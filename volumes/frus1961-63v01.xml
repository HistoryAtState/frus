                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts that contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>

                            certain political actions and ideas about military-civilian
                            relationships. The Ambassador completed his comments by stating that
                            consideration should be given to what steps “we are prepared to take to

                        <p>(1) Communist-inspired insurgency in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
                            aimed at the destruction of authority and prestige of established
                            government, is a prelude to further inroads designed ultimately to
                            absorb <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> into the Communist bloc.</p>
                        <p>(2) Existing Conditions:</p>
                        <p>(a) General: Developments in South Viet-Nam over the past year indicate a
                            trend that is adverse to the stability and effectiveness of President
                            Diem’s government. Beginning in December 1959 and continuing to the
                            present, there has been a mounting increase throughout South Viet-Nam of
                            Viet Cong terrorist activities and guerrilla warfare. This activity has
                            included armed propaganda and leaflet distribution; taxing of the
                            population for food, money, and medicines; kidnapping and murder of
                            village and hamlet officials, <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0024"/>road
                            and canal ambushes; and armed attacks against agrovilles, land
                            development centers, Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps posts, as well
                            as small army units. Through the use of these tactics current Viet Cong
                            military and political objectives are the overthrow of the Diem
                            Government. Their immediate objectives are to eliminate any semblance of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control in rural areas,
                            particularly the Mekong Delta, and establish so-called “liberated
                            zones.”</p>
                        <p>(b) Political: Politically, discontent with the Diem Government has been
                            prevalent for some time among intellectuals and elite circles and has
                            been rising among the peasantry and, to some extent, labor and urban
                            business groups. Criticism of these elements focuses on Ngo family rule,
                            especially the roles of the President’s brother, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NDN2">Madame Nhu</persName> and the influence of the
                            clandestine Can Lao political apparatus of the regime. An even more
                            important element in the political situation is the criticism of the
                            President’s leadership within government circles, including the official
                            bureaucracy and the military. In the past, such discontent and criticism
                            had been centered on Diem’s brothers, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo
                                Dinh Nhu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo
                                Dinh</persName> Can, as directors of the allegedly corrupt Can Lao
                            Party.</p>
                        <p>Further aggravating many of the government’s problems is the active and
                            partly successful campaign of the Viet Cong to discredit President Diem
                            and weaken the government’s authority through political subversion, as
                            well as through military action. Among other factors making this
                            possible is the void between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            its people which stems from the failure of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to communicate understandably with the population and,
                            in reverse, the lack of an effective mechanism whereby the people can in
                            their terms communicate with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            Taking advantage of this lack of effective communication and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s inability to protect the people the
                            Viet Cong has had considerable success in sowing disaffection and
                            disrupting effective administration of the government among the
                            population. This is especially true in the Capital, 1st and 5th Military
                            Regions. Viet Cong successes in these regions are due to the large
                            number among the population who, whether out of terror or sympathy, give
                            support to the Viet Cong. Aided by this situation, the Viet Cong is
                            striving to establish a political apparatus parallel to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Below province level in the 5th
                            Military Region, no effective <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            control exists in many areas. The Viet Cong are increasing the void by
                            taxation, terroristic acts, attacks on Self Defense posts, assassination
                            of village and provincial officials, and simultaneously a systematic
                            development of the Viet Cong political apparatus to fill the void. In
                            view of the above conditions the principal task facing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is restoration of individual
                            security.</p>
                        <p>(c) Military: Military force, in the form of increased communist
                            insurgency, is clearly the major immediate threat to the stability of
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0025"/>VietNam today. South Viet-Nam
                            is unique in that it is the only country in the world which is forced to
                            defend itself against a communist internal subversion action, while at
                            the same time being subject to the militarily supportable threat of a
                            conventional external attack from communist North Viet-Nam. The <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> force basis is inadequate to meet
                            both these threats.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">See two last sentences of
                                penultimate paragraph of covering despatch for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName>’s views on this subject.
                                [Footnote in the source text. Regarding these views, see <ref target="#d1fn1">footnote 1</ref> above.]</note></p>
                        <p>The problem is twofold, although at present the counterinsurgency phase
                            is the more dangerous and immediate. In this counterinsurgency fight
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is on the defensive.
                            Approximately 75% of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is committed
                            to pacification missions, about half of these being committed to static
                            guard and security roles. The military chain of command has usually been
                            violated at the expense of unity of effort and command. No adequate
                            operations control or overall planning system presently exists, although
                            significant progress has been made in the development of military plans.
                            The President has exercised arbitrary control of operations, by-passing
                            command channels of the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> and often
                            Corps and Division staff. Resources have been fragmented to provincial
                            control. The above practices appear to have been designed to divide
                            responsibility in order to guard against the possibility of a military
                            coup through placing too much power in the hands of a single
                            subordinate. The guerrilla problem has become much more serious than the
                            Civil Guard can manage, thereby requiring a disproportionately large
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> commitment, which has
                            further resulted in a serious weakening of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> capability for defense against internal or overt
                            attack in force. Rotation within <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            and Civil Guard cannot be accomplished regularly. Many units have been
                            on operations for a year or more without relief, because <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> strength is insufficient to permit
                            an adequate rotation policy and to conduct adequate border and coastal
                            surveillance. Many troops are battle weary, in a state of low morale,
                            and in need of recuperation and training. Notwithstanding the above
                            deficiencies, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> plans have recently
                            been developed for the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> Command
                            Control and Logistic structure which upon implementation, possibly in
                            the near future, should correct major deficiencies if adequate military
                            strength is provided.</p>
                        <p>The complete divorce of command control from logistics support in the
                            field has resulted in a lethargic and cumbersome requisitioning and
                            supply system. Requisitions from tactical units even below division
                            level must be submitted through channels to agencies of the Defense
                            Department in Saigon with consequent red tape before issues can be
                            authorized and deliveries effected. Reorganization plans <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0026"/>being developed will establish “Logistic
                            Commands” in place of present military regions and under operational
                            control of their respective Corps commanders, thus enabling tactical
                            units to follow-through on deliveries against their requisitions. The
                            poor, and in some regions nonexistent, communications systems and road
                            net are primary logistics obstacle [obstacles] in Viet-Nam. Although the
                            President has continued to make strenuous efforts to improve the road
                            net, military movements must continue to rely on light more mobile
                            systems and airlift for the foreseeable future. Implementation of the
                            concept of light mobile logistic support with pack supply suitable to
                            mountain trails is urgent if <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is
                            to take offensive against insurgency.</p>
                        <p>Some elements of desirable counterinsurgency actions have been
                            recommended piecemeal to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> authorities. These elements have
                            been incorporated herein in order to form a comprehensive and
                            coordinated plan for counterinsurgency actions. President Diem and
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> military authorities appear
                            to be receptive to significant improvement of the national military
                            establishment and some of the actions contemplated by this plan have
                            actually been taken and others are under consideration by the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> authorities. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s plans for implementing
                            counterinsurgency measures are progressing at an increasing tempo
                            concurrently with the preparation of this counterinsurgency plan. It
                            should, therefore, be read with the thought that some elements may
                            already have been implemented or may be in the process of
                            implementation.</p>
                        <p>The current military intelligence capability of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is inadequate to support the
                            critical intelligence requirements of all echelons of the armed forces.
                            Although the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has recently agreed
                            that improvement is needed the intelligence agencies of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> are not now adequately integrated with
                            the various military and quasimilitary intelligence systems. The
                            processing of military intelligence is too slow for timely tactical
                            reaction. The major reason for this slow intelligence responsiveness is
                            the total lack of an adequate civilian communications system in the
                            provinces. While the military command communications system is
                            frequently the best in an area, it is often inadequate, overcrowded, and
                            not comprehensive enough for anti-insurgency intelligence gathering and
                            disseminating needs.</p>
                        <p>(d) Economic: The economic health of the country, though not robust, has
                            been improving rapidly. In the future, if current economic trends
                            continue and the economy is not further disrupted by adverse security
                            developments, the economy will be able, insofar as physical wealth is
                            concerned, to provide for the consumption needs of a growing population
                            and at the same time to finance a steadily increasing proportion of
                            local military costs and could under favorable conditions meet
                            essentially all these costs. Along with lack of <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0027"/>confidence in the future, a principal deterrent to
                            economic progress is the avowed and effective <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> campaign for the systematic sabotage of the public works
                            program including progressive destruction of lines of communication,
                            structures, agrovilles and the like when left unprotected by Civil Guard
                            or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units.</p>
                        <p>For the first several years after institution of direct U.S. aid to
                            Viet-Nam the aid level was determined primarily on a budgetary gap
                            basis, but early in 1959 this was shifted to a balance of payments
                            basis. Since exports plus aid received exceeded imports, sizeable
                            foreign exchange reserves were accumulated. The increase in reserves,
                            together with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s reluctance to
                            tax the wealth accumulating in private hands, has led to a large money
                            supply and an increasing budgetary deficit which could cause
                            inflation.</p>
                        <p>Distribution of income is very uneven, with rural population receiving
                            little of the benefits of an expanding economy, a fact which is believed
                            to bear on their lack of positive support for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The earlier U.S. Country Team-approved military budget of 6,066.9 million
                            piastres for 1961 does not include various <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> proposals relating to the military and security forces.
                            The budgetary aspects of these proposals will be fully discussed in
                            Appendix IV to Annex C which will be submitted separately.</p>
                        <p>The several proposals in this counterinsurgency plan (see table on
                            following page) will further increase the costs of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s military and related budgets for
                            security forces by perhaps as much as 478.8 million piastres. In
                            subsequent years if the 20,000 force level increase is fully realized,
                            annual costs of the Counterinsurgency Plan proposals will be about 876.9
                            million piastres.</p>
                        <p>In addition, a number of other suggestions have been accepted by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, such as subsidization of rice
                            prices to peasants, which will further increase financial pressures.
                            Still other suggestions have been made, such as establishment of a
                            system of payment for corvee labor and institution of a system of
                            subsidies for agroville inhabitants, which, if accepted by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, would add even more to budgetary
                            costs.</p>

                        <p>General Lansdale visited Vietnam from January 2 to 14, 1961. On January
                            17, he reported on his trip in a memorandum to Secretary of Defense
                            Gates, recommending: “The U.S. should recognize that Vietnam is in a
                            critical condition and should treat it as a combat area of the cold war,
                            as an area requiring emergency treatment.” For text of the memorandum,

                                    Viet-Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note></item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether the
                            President would prefer to consider this report first or have a briefing
                            from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> on the Viet-Nam
                            counter-insurgency plan<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3"><ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note>just submitted by the Country Team at
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> then outlined the
                            plan, saying that it comprehended not only military, but political,
                            economic and psychological programs. Inspired originally by Defense, it
                            was worked out by a group chaired in the Embassy with participants from
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Apart from the recommendation for a
                            20,000-man increase in the Vietnamese army and accelerated training
                            under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> of the 30,000-man civil
                            guard, the plan recommended organizational changes in the Vietnamese
                            Government having to do with security planning and execution,
                            centralization of intelligence and other factors. The initial cost of
                            the army and civil guard portions of the plan would be approximately $40
                            million chargeable to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> said that the essence of the plan, including
                            analysis of <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0036"/>the situation,
                            assumptions, tasks and recommendations, was in a 20 page double-spaced
                            prelude to the full text. He added that, as regards status of the plan
                            in Washington, it had only just arrived, was elaborated in some 220
                            pages of detail and in the State Department had received initial
                            approval only at the lower levels of the Far Eastern Bureau. It was
                            probable that <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> would recommend to the
                            Secretary that all the main features should be implemented as speedily
                            as possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> did not
                            know its status in other Departments. He also mentioned that the Country
                            Team believed that implementation of the military portions of the plan
                            would enable the Vietnamese army to turn from the defensive to the
                            offensive against the Viet Cong guerrillas.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that if the situation in Viet-Nam was now so
                            serious he wondered why the recruitment of troops and the training of
                            police, who could become effective only a year or two hence, would be of
                            any use. He also wondered why, if there were only 10,000 guerrillas, an
                            increase from 150 to 170,000 in the army was necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName> responded that it was
                            the judgment of the people out there that this plan would be useful,
                            that civil guard training was already under way, and that it should be
                            borne in mind that the Vietnamese army had two tasks, first to provide a
                            deterrent against conventional attack by the 300,000-man army of north
                            Viet-Nam and, second, to combat widespread and determined insurgency
                            over a large area which, of course, has elsewhere pinned down a much
                            greater number of men.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President’s invitation, General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> spoke at some length along
                            the lines of his report. He also said in reference to the
                            counter-insurgency plan that it was written in the Defense Department
                            and then sent out to Saigon for further consideration. He said that he
                            had found that relations between the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and President
                            Diem were excellent and that the spirit of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> people was
                            constructive. Regrettably, it was otherwise in the Embassy and the
                            Foreign Service people were defeatist and not as interested as they
                            should be.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s reference to the morale of President Diem and
                            his belief that the Ambassador and others were not fully behind him and
                            perhaps favored the coup d'etat rebels. He wondered if a letter or some
                            gesture from the new administration would help. General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> thought that something of
                            this nature would help a great deal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he had
                            received a draft letter for the President to send in response to
                            President Diem’s congratulations<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">Neither
                                letter has been found.</note>
                            <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0037"/>and had sent it back for further
                            redrafting with this morale problem in mind. It should reach the
                            President shortly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> emphasized the
                            need for speed and for doing those things which would increase
                            immediately the anti-guerrilla capability in Viet-Nam. With Mr.
                                <persName>Broe</persName> he also mentioned the limited efforts
                            being made to produce South Vietnamese guerrillas capable of harassing
                            the north Vietnamese. Mr. <persName>Broe</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJG1">Parsons</persName>’ remark that thus far
                            the Vietnamese Government had not been very receptive to this program.
                            He added that the teams which had been trained were being used in the
                            contaminated areas of South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> mentioned that
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> and his staff
                            had had a very difficult role to play over these past three and a half
                            years. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> had had the
                            unpalatable task of balancing representations designed to persuade
                            President Diem to undertake reforms and other tasks to improve the
                            Vietnamese position against the need to assure him of our support and
                            friendship. This was never easy nor was President Diem an easy person.
                            He thought that the Ambassador had energetically and effectively done
                            this but that it was now time for a change and he should be relieved in
                            the near future.<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">On January 25, Wood drafted a

                            <item>The President then asked whether this order of magnitude of
                                increase in the armed forces of Viet-Nam would really permit a shift
                                from the defense to the offense. He asked whether the situation was
                                not basically one of politics and morale.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>It was explained that a very high proportion of total Viet-Nam
                                forces was now pinned on the front facing a Viet Minh force of
                                300,000.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The President asked whether guerrilla forces could be mounted in
                                the Viet Minh area. It was explained that Diem had shown thus far
                                little taste for such operations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that four teams of eight men each had
                                been organized for harassment; that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had other notions about offensive operations; but
                                thus far these teams had been allocated to working on a series of
                                guerrilla pockets in the south of the country, which had moved in
                                over the Laos border. General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> said that he was familiar with the plan, as
                                was Diem. He said that any plan that could work would require that
                                the Vietnamese themselves become fully engaged. Diem’s view was that
                                some parts of the American plan made sense, others would be very
                                difficult. For example, he has been able to find only three men who
                                could bear serious executive responsibility beneath him; only three
                                men who could make tough decisions and not simply buck them upward
                                to himself. He also said that he believed an increment of 20,000 men
                                to the armed forces could significantly affect the margin in the
                                field available for counter-guerrilla operations. The Communists had
                                just begun serious political work in the field. Their objective was
                                to organize some kind of political front capable of bringing Diem
                                down, which they could dominate.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The President asked what his estimate of the prospects was.
                                Lansdale replied that the Communists regard 1961 as their big year.
                                He believed that a maximum American effort could frustrate a
                                definitive effort in 1961 and move over into the offensive in 1962.
                                The essentials were three: first, the Americans in Viet-Nam must
                                themselves be infused with high morale and a will to win, and they
                                must get close to the Vietnamese; secondly, the Vietnamese must, in
                                this setting, be moved to act with vigor and confidence; third, Diem
                                must be persuaded to let the opposition coalesce in some legitimate
                                form rather than concentrate on the task of killing him. It was
                                Diem’s view that there are Americans in the Foreign Service who are
                                very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11. Lansdale
                                found it impossible to dissuade him that this was a fact. Diem felt
                                confidence in the Americans in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. He
                                had <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0040"/>tried to persuade Diem to
                                appoint his brother to an executive position out in the open; but
                                Diem apparently needed the confidence of his brother’s advice, given
                                at night and in the early morning; Diem did not believe his brother
                                had executive competence; and the loss of his brother—perhaps in an
                                ambassadorship—would be a traumatic experience for Diem.</item>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> said that if
                                Laos goes to the Communists, we might not have time to organize the
                                turn-around required in American and Viet-Nam morale and
                                action.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> described the
                                recent increase in the number of transmission stations used by the
                                Communists to instruct the guerrillas in Viet-Nam, an increase from
                                11 to 29. He advocated a quick beef-up of counter-guerrilla forces
                                before the 20,000 increment was organized. He advocated a review
                                within our government of training of foreign guerrillas, a program
                                for which there was no clear-cut line of authority. He said the
                                    <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> organization was excellent
                                but had no adequate provision for pare-military forces. There was no
                                clear authority in Washington; the funding problem was not clear;
                                and the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was properly confined to
                                the training of the <gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>-type men to
                                seek out and identify dangerous Communists.</item>

                            <item>The President again stated he wants guerrillas to operate in the
                                north and asked what the situation there was. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied the people were
                                unhappy and that the government was strong. The military forces
                                consisted of over a quarter of a million men. Moscow had its men in
                                the government bureaus; but the Chinese Communists were more widely
                                spread about in Viet Minh territory.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> explained that the
                                diplomats in Viet-Nam face an extremely frustrating task. They were
                                caught between pressing Diem to do things he did not wish to do and
                                the need to convey to him American support. It was a difficult
                                balance to strike; and Diem was extremely sensitive to
                                criticism.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>The President asked whether he should write to Diem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said this would be a good idea,
                                as part of a new approach by the new Ambassador. It was agreed there
                                would be an early Presidential statement backing the effort in
                                Viet-Nam. The President asked how do we change morale; how do we get
                                operations in the north; how do we get moving? It was replied that
                                the funding problem would be difficult. The emergency fund was low.
                                We already had $41,000,000 committed to Viet-Nam and $30,000,000
                                committed to Laos. The President expressed in the meeting, as he
                                expressed to me personally, his desire to be fully informed with
                                respect to the emergency fund. He wishes a Viet-Nam task force set
                                up like the Cuba task force. The question of whether General

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Friend:</hi> Your thoughtful kindness made the
                            trip to Vietnam a most interesting and memorable one for me. I was happy
                            to see you looking so well, despite the many problems you face every <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0043"/>day, and it was a real pleasure
                            to have had visits with you. So, thank you for all your help, for
                            letting Nguyen Dinh Thuan go along on the 5th Military Region trip, and
                            for the sandwiches you sent along! I know that Joe Redick would want to
                            join me in expressing appreciation, too.</p>
                        <p>On the way home, I stopped in Hawaii for a visit at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. I had good talks with Admiral
                            Felt and his staff. I called attention to the grave dangers of the
                            current Viet Cong threat and the need for some extra attention by the
                            U.S. He was extremely interested and, although understandably engaged
                            with urgent duties concerning Laos, put some of his staff to work
                            promptly on your problems. I understand that he sent General Thiemer out
                            for a visit.</p>
                        <p>In Washington, Secretary Gates and Deputy Secretary Douglas of Defense
                            were most receptive to my report.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> Douglas in particular
                            called it to the attention of our top people at the White House and
                            State Department. When the new Administration took office, Douglas went
                            to considerable lengths to make our new leaders aware of the situation.
                            He is a very staunch friend. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName>, also, has been most helpful. General Lemnitzer
                            and Admiral Burke had been instrumental in getting me out on the trip
                            and have taken great interest in what I reported.</p>
                        <p>The new Defense leaders (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul
                                Nitze</persName> the new Assistant Secretary for <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>) all had me in for talks with them
                            about your problems. Then, last Saturday, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> had me in for a long talk on
                            the subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">See <ref target="#d3">Documents
                                    3</ref> and <ref target="#d4">4</ref>.</note>He was warmly
                            interested and asked many questions. I am sure that you can count upon
                            him as an understanding friend and that you will be hearing further
                            about this. It would have “warmed your heart” to have heard this
                            conversation. So, you see, you do have some sincere friends in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>However, there will be some here who will point out that much of the
                            danger of your present situation comes about from your own actions. They
                            say that you try to do too many things yourself, that you refuse to give
                            real responsibility to others and keep interfering with what they do,
                            that you feel you are infallible personally, and that too many of your
                            organizations like the Republican Youth Corps and the Can Lao Party are
                            actually formed by coercion—that is, people join because they are afraid
                            not to—rather than being genuine organizations rooted in the hearts of
                            the Vietnamese people. I believe there will be many of these criticisms
                            voiced in private talks here as word gets around about favorable
                            reactions to my report.</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0044"/>
                        <p>The best answer to these criticisms would be actions by you in Vietnam.
                            The critics would then have to close their mouths in the face of your
                            actions. One action would be for you to announce your reorganization of
                            the government very soon. Also, you could make your Security Council
                            become alive and dynamic. Please remember my suggestion: call the
                            military commanders and province chiefs in from the 1st and 5th Military
                            Regions—to meet with the Security Council. You could make a talk to this
                            group, and broadcast it all over Vietnam to all of the people of
                            Vietnam. Your country needs you to rouse spirits right now, the way
                            Winston Churchill did for Britain at a dark hour. Your countrymen need
                            to be told that Vietnam is in grave danger from the Communists, that the
                            help of every citizen is welcomed by the government, and that Vietnam
                            must and will be kept free and independent.</p>
                        <p>After your talk to this group, it would be smart to turn the meeting over
                            to Vice President <persName>Tho</persName> or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. The meeting should be a secret
                            one. I believe that each province chief, each responsible military
                            commander, and the regional delegues, should report openly and frankly
                            on the problems they have in their own areas. You did this once before,
                            in February 1955, and it was a very wise and healthy action. You will
                            hear many things, not only bad problems but also good ideas. So will all
                            of those at such a meeting.</p>
                        <p>It would help you very much if you could include some of the Americans
                            who are trying to help you—let them attend this meeting and take notes.
                            You can invite those you believe to be sincere. They, too, would learn a
                            lot and would become more realistic in their work in Vietnam. I would
                            include <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Now, the political opposition to you worries me greatly. I have thought
                            about it for many hours and days since leaving Vietnam. There is much
                            ugly talk and bad feeling among many people in Saigon. It is so ugly and
                            bad that I am afraid it will prompt some thoughtless persons to attempt
                            another coup. You are one of the great leaders of the Free World and a
                            friend for whom I have deep affection. So, please take my words in the
                            friendship with which they are offered.</p>
                        <p>Simply suppressing this political feeling of opposition by arresting
                            people or closing down newspapers will only turn the talk into deep
                            emotions of hatred and generate the formation of more clandestine
                            organizations and plots to oppose you. This is so far from your real
                            nature and your gifted talents of leadership that I know you are seeking
                            a better solution.</p>
                        <p>An idea suggests itself for your consideration of this problem of the
                            political opposition. If you could get most of the oppositionists
                            working on a program of specific ideas to save the nation, and to work
                            on this program freely among themselves outside of the <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0045"/>government, you would turn the major
                            share of their political energies into constructive work. They would
                            argue among themselves over their ideas, trying to get each other to
                            accept these ideas, rather than spend their political energies attacking
                            you.</p>
                        <p>How do you do this? Perhaps you yourself cannot. But, you are the only
                            person who can set the proper political climate for such an action. It
                            needs you to tell the people, including the oppositionists, that Vietnam
                            is in grave danger. It needs you to remove the lurking fear of secret
                            arrest at night as punishment for political activity; whether such fears
                            are based on fact or falsehood, the point is that many people believe
                            that special police under Dr. <persName>Tuyen</persName> make political
                            arrests at night, with the knowledge of your brother Nhu.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the wisest move would be to call in the younger people among the
                            opposition. It would be best if you talked to them personally. You might
                            tell them that Vietnam stands to lose its freedom, that all Vietnamese
                            must go to work now to save that freedom, that you know the
                            oppositionists have not agreed with all your programs but that running a
                            government which is under savage Communist attack is not as simple as
                            critics apparently think. You want people not to merely criticize their
                            government. If they believe they have good ideas, they should write
                            these down and agree to a program they believe would save the country.
                            Not a Communist program, but a program by Free Vietnamese. If they go to
                            work to write and agree upon such a program, you can assure them that
                            you won't stand in their way—even if it means the formation of a strong,
                            single opposition party.</p>
                        <p>You might talk to them, too, the way you did to me in 1955 and 1956—that
                            your dream for Vietnam was to have two strong political parties. You
                            might point out that you called the younger people in from the
                            opposition groups because they are the ones who have to build the
                            future. They will live in it. Too many of the older politicians are
                            living in the past or are selfishly looking for power for
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Well, this became a very long letter. My suggestions were prompted by the
                            fact that many people in Washington, just like many people in Asia, are
                            watching you right now to see what you will do next. I am sure that
                            whatever you do, you will do it resolutely and with wisdom. I will help
                            to the extent that an American official can.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gentlemen:</hi> This Senior Advisors meeting has
                            been called to discuss our mutual problems, bring you up-to-date, and
                            refine our Better Automobile, or Tactics and Techniques paper.<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">Not further identified.</note> With the rapid
                            turn-over we have here in Vietnam, you'll notice many new faces today
                            that were not with us in November and I want you all to make it a point
                            to get acquainted. In this respect, I am sorry the operational situation
                            and the wide dispersal of advisory detachments prevents more frequent
                            meetings. Therefore, let’s all take maximum advantage of this
                            opportunity to exchange ideas among each other and with the members of
                            my staff.</p>
                        <p>Before proceeding with the meeting proper, I wish to take this
                            opportunity to clarify and reemphasize the official U.S. and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> position toward the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and President Diem.</p>
                        <p>Here in Saigon, in particular, as well as in the Provinces where you are
                            stationed, you have heard many rumors and statements about the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and President Diem. These run the gamut
                            from corruption of governmental officials, to nepotism, favoritism,
                            political dogmatism, undue interference by Diem in military matters, and
                            normally end with the statement or implication, that Diem “must go” if
                            the country is to be saved.</p>
                        <p>These rumors and statements are normally instigated by dissatisfied
                            politicians, misled intellectuals, Communists or certain elements of the
                            foreign community. Human nature being what it is, these rumors are,
                            unfortunately, picked up, repeated and elaborated <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0047"/>upon by certain elements of the U.S.
                            community here in Vietnam and by certain well meaning Vietnamese
                            officers and civilians.</p>
                        <p>Although there may possibly be some degree of validity to some of these
                            rumors—there always is—they are mostly based on the Communist technique
                            of half truths and insinuations and are not supported by hard facts. It
                            has been my observation over a period of years that our Armed Forces are
                            not entirely immune to this questionable pastime. I am convinced that
                            the best defense against rumor is truth. With this in mind, the U.S.
                            policy towards the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and President
                            Diem is clear and unequivocal. Briefly stated, it is that the U.S.
                            supports the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and President Diem.
                            That although Diem has certain shortcomings, as do we all, he is
                            pro-U.S., definitely anti-Communist, and has done a remarkably fine job
                            during his five years in office against terrific odds. He is the most
                            tough minded, dedicated practicing anti-Communist leader among our
                            friends today.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it is only fair that all personnel of this <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> refrain from giving credence—tacit or
                            openly—to these unfavorable rumors regarding President Diem and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Remember that they cannot be
                            proven—and that there is definitely less corruption in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> than most similar countries. Diem will
                            not countenance it!</p>

                        <p>1329. In view of General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s experience in Viet-Nam, I have given
                            considerable attention and thought to the suggestions he made in <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> 172157Z January,<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">In this telegram, Lansdale concluded that the

                                that a coup attempt might soon follow. He suggested two U.S. actions
                                to forestall this possibility and the resulting chaos: 1) a clear
                                statement of U.S. support for Diem and 2) U.S. encouragement of the
                                opposition to form a responsible party. (Ibid., Internal Security,

                                    in light of recent critical US press comment which have tended
                                    encourage activities of all elements completely disunited and
                                    disorganized non-Communist opposition, most of whom erroneously

                                    be highly appropriate, two facts make any more pointed statement

                                        <item>We have devoted considerable effort pressing Diem to
                                            adopt certain needed liberalizing reforms and changes in
                                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> methods and
                                            structure which we believe he should adopt in his own
                                            interests in order to win further popular support
                                            vitally needed in face of growing <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military and political threat. While we
                                            have been told that many of our suggestions are under
                                            active consideration, considerable time has been lost
                                            since November attempted coup with little action taken.
                                            Therefore at this juncture strong public reiteration US
                                            support toward Diem personally might further convince
                                            him that we have no alternative but to support him no
                                            matter what he does. Such statement, therefore, might
                                            induce him further to procrastinate from taking
                                            necessary actions which I am convinced he must do to

                            <item>While the ideal of a two-party system with a constitutional
                                opposition should be our long-range goal for Viet-Nam, I have
                                considerable reservation as to the possibility of accomplishing this
                                in the near future or of the practicality and desirability of
                                actively pressing for it at this time. The Vietnamese people lack
                                the necessary <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0049"/>sophistication
                                and understanding, as well as the necessary sense of political
                                responsibility to make a two-party democratic system work at this
                                time. Furthermore, and more important, one key element of Vietnamese
                                scene is lack of any hopes of opposition leadership or any
                                distinction in diverse oppositionists’ minds between a
                                constitutional and unconstitutional opposition. Furthermore none has
                                any clear-cut realistic program to offer. Thus any effort on our
                                part to try to unite the heterogeneous non-Communist opposition
                                elements into a cohesive loyal opposition would not only be most
                                difficult if not impossible but might easily develop into real
                                effort to unseat Diem, independent of any constitutional niceties,
                                in a mistaken belief US desires replace Diem. Furthermore, in light
                                of the current, most serious <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                                threat, any such effort on our part would be considered by Diem as
                                mortal blow to his regime and would negate any encouraging official
                                statements we might make. Moreover, such US effort would tend to
                                drive Diem further to count on use of force only to win battle
                                against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and almost guarantee that
                                he would take or implement few if any of the essential steps we have
                                urged him to take in his own interests. Diem already is of strong
                                belief that US does not understand or appreciate the problems of a
                                newly-independent country, half-occupied by Communists, and that we
                                tend to think, despite realities of situation, that adoption of full
                                democratic procedures will win day.</item>

                        <p>Is it possible for us to distribute the available forces we now have in
                            Vietnam more effectively in order to increase the effectiveness of
                            anti-guerilla activities. Are there troops stationed along the border
                            who could be made available for this activity? It is my recollection
                            that the Vietnam army now numbers 150,000, and that we are planning to
                            add 20,000 more, making a total of 170,000. Reports are that the
                            guerillas number from 7,000 to 15,000. I would think that the
                            redistribution of available forces immediately would make them more
                            effective in this work and we would not have to wait for action during
                            the training period of the new troops. Would you give me your judgment
                            on this when next we meet?</p>

                                reforms aimed at decentralizing governmental powers, improving
                                democratic institutions and village administration, and encouraging

                            Answers to questions straight-forward and helpful. After conference Diem
                            did good public relations job, joking with correspondents in relaxed
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>Not surprisingly, reforms announced have number of positive and negative
                            aspects, but tone as whole is encouraging. With enough time to work them
                            out in detail, and if Diem grants more authority to Department heads as
                            he said he would, result should be improved functioning of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Reforms clearly go considerably beyond more modest and hesitant list of

                                (Ibid., 751K.00/1-3061)</note> Most encouraging aspects include
                            following: (1) General tone is forward-looking, and reforms clearly
                            product of prolonged reflection and discussion on part of President and
                            most progressive elements in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; (2)
                            Emphasis is wisely placed on improved administration of functioning
                            programs through better coordination of existing agencies, thus making
                            use of momentum already gained and avoiding personnel problems that more
                            radical change would have entailed; (3) Movement into some new fields
                            such as elected youth member of village councils (for youth and
                            information matters) and establishment of councils at national level to
                            promote economic, social, and cultural activity; (4) Some
                            decentralization of power from provincial down to municipal and village
                            levels.</p>
                        <p>Notably lacking were political changes of an impact nature or any
                            immediate concessions of democratic freedoms except election youth
                            representative. Diem’s answers this connection might have shown more
                            finesse, particularly on village council elections, but he did admit
                            frankly that because of security situation it not possible permit

                        <p>Program Diem announced February 6 is substantial, forward-looking and, if

                            forty-five minute talk.</p>
                        <p>After reading letter, Diem and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> expressed concern as to how they could finance
                            piaster costs for twenty thousand additional men. I told them plan
                            included concrete suggestions how this could be accomplished and
                            expressed firm conviction that by taking extraordinary measures <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could raise sufficient piasters.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stated Ford Foundation
                            financial group here had just recently expressed some doubt as to how
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could raise more piasters in
                            near future. I replied I hoped our suggestions would help them find
                            solution. Diem then spoke some length about extraordinary expenses he is
                            faced with backing planned road along Cambodian border from Gulf of
                            Siam, road in Tay Ninh area and costs of many other essential projects.
                            He then stated he needed at least 5,000 more troops immediately to help
                            guard construction gangs, for instance those to complete Kontum-Tourane
                            road, new industries being built, as well as to give more protection to
                            population. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> asked what our
                            position would be if, for instance, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            could not see way to finance plan as whole. I replied plan is
                            comprehensive document and therefore all facets should basically be
                            carried out although our position not inflexible and we ready work up
                            agreed plan.</p>
                        <p>Diem then outlined Communist plans to disrupt election which he learned
                            from captured documents. Communists have two plans: (1) To prevent
                            people from voting in elections, or (2) to try to induce enough people
                            to vote for weakest presidential candidate so as to establish weak
                            government in south Viet-Nam which would be easy prey to Communists
                            later. According Diem, reasons Communists less active on terrorist front
                            January was because they have regrouped their cadres to indoctrinate
                            them on how to disrupt elections and train others to carry out phase two
                            of Communist plan, <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0054"/>i.e., cause
                            riots, demonstrations and bombings in cities. He stated Communists will
                            try some bombing during Tet. Because of this he has to deploy large
                            number present security forces around Saigon to thwart Communist’s plan.
                            Diem’s remarks added up to: His piaster expenses are extraordinarily
                            high and he does not know where he can get more; and he needs more
                            troops immediately to give protection to installations and people and
                            prevent Communists from disruption elections.</p>
                        <p>We discussed <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations for about forty minutes (reported

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> recalled that he
                            had visited Viet-Nam six or seven years ago. He hoped he would again be
                            able to visit Viet-Nam. He had met the then Prime Minister, Nguyen Van
                            Tham, who had seen the necessity of giving the people of Viet-Nam
                            reforms and more freedom. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> recalled that Tham had good ideas, but had lacked
                            courage. Secretary Bowles agreed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> emphasized that President Diem by contrast, had
                            had <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0055"/>enough courage to tell the
                            French that complete independence was necessary for Viet-Nam. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> then mentioned the
                            Communist tactic of distributing land to the landless and emphasized how
                            important it was to provide land for the peasants. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> mentioned that in some cases
                            where this was done too rapidly the peasants found themselves with
                            insufficient land, livestock and tools. Secretary Bowles agreed that
                            land reform had to be well-planned and then mentioned the success of
                            such programs in Thailand and Japan. He also mentioned the effectiveness
                            of the Indian Civil Service whose people, although not originally
                            trained for agriculture, were such good administrators that they were
                            now able to supply Rural Extension Service to about 70% of India. He
                            then spoke warmly of <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Wolf
                                Ladejinsky</persName>’s role in the land reform program of Japan.
                            Ambassador Chuang recalled that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LW1">Ladejinsky</persName> was now working for the Government of
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> said that in his
                            view, the peasants not only wanted more material things but also a sense
                            of justice and of participation in the government.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> asked if the
                            Under Secretary would give him specific comments on the present
                            situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> said
                            that it was certainly necessary to be extremely firm with the Russian
                            and Chinese Communists; but at the same time, military power was not
                            enough. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>
                            commented that French failures had certainly proved that point.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> continued that we
                            wished to bring the people of Southeast Asia together so that they would
                            have a sense of common destiny. This was not easy. They had traditional
                            differences, but our aim was to help these people to be confident in
                            their own future rather than to be grateful to the United States. He
                            cited the analogy of the British who in the 19th century through the
                            protection of their fleet made it possible for the United States to grow
                            into a strong country. It would seem that the main ingredients needed
                            domestically within the countries of Southeast Asia were justice and
                            more equality.</p>
                        <p>As to our relations with Viet-Nam, the Secretary emphasized we would
                            certainly continue our support and live up to our treaty obligations. It
                            would also be found that there would be a greater emphasis on looking
                            further ahead and on long-range projects such as the Mekong Valley.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> agreed on the
                            necessity of closer cooperation among the nations of Southeast Asia,
                            continued cooperation with the United States and a greater sense of
                            participation amongst the Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> said that if such
                            a spirit could be built up, there would no longer be the feeling that
                            the Viet Cong were aiming <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0056"/>their
                            attacks against the United States, but rather that they were attacking
                            the future of the Vietnamese people themselves.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>, referring to
                            Laos and Viet-Nam, said that a war situation existed and that Asia was
                            terribly weak in terms of defending itself. Thus in planning for the
                            future of Asia it should be remembered that free Asia must sail with the
                            wind. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> suggested that it
                            was also possible to tack into the wind.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> mentioned the
                            usefulness of the Civil Guard and the fact that the Government of
                            Viet-Nam paid for its support.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> inquired how much
                            taxes the Vietnamese Government collected. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> talked rapidly, replying that
                            good taxes required good production.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> spoke of the importance
                            of strengthening <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and said that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was planning to
                            attend the Council Meeting on March 27. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> asked if the Secretary might
                            consider stopping off at Saigon. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> made it clear that the Secretary would even have

                        <p>Lord <persName>Hood</persName> felt that it would be worth discussing the
                            present tensions and threats which existed in Viet-Nam. Mr.
                                <persName>White</persName> requested Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> to give our views briefly.</p>
                        <p>After stating that the nadir might have been passed during the last month
                            or two, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> spoke of the
                            repeated suggestions which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> had made on the subject of liberalization,
                            indicating that while the Vietnamese were well aware of our views, we
                            would continue to keep this subject alive. However, there was some
                            feeling that certain Western observers, especially newspapermen, tended
                            to over-stress the question of liberalizing the regime. There were other
                            illiberal regimes in Asia. While it was perhaps more important for
                            President Diem to establish a better “dialogue” with his people, the
                            main problem in Viet-Nam appeared to be the Communist threat. As to
                            liberalization, we had noted some responsiveness on President Diem’s
                            part; the National Assembly was playing a somewhat greater role and the
                            press occasionally gave voice to cautious criticism.</p>
                        <p>As to security, we had recently put forward to the Vietnamese Government
                            a plan<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2"><ref target="#d1">Document
                                1</ref>.</note> which had been carefully worked out by our various
                            specialists and had been approved in Washington at a very high level. In
                            general this plan called for certain changes in the Vietnamese
                            Government which would increase its efficiency in dealing with the
                            Communists and envisaged increasing the Vietnamese armed forces by
                            20,000 men. Certain parts of the plan had already <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0058"/>been adopted, such as our training
                            program for the Civil Guard. We had recently explained this plan to
                            President Diem.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">See <ref target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> In addition to requiring a great deal
                            of cooperation on both sides, it would also cost the Vietnamese a good
                            deal of their own money. We felt that their economy was capable of
                            meeting these additional expenses. President Diem had not been sure of
                            this when the plan was explained to him. For the present the plan was
                            being studied by the Vietnamese Government. It did not seem profitable
                            to go into detail on the plan until agreement had been reached with the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>We had been pleased by President Diem’s press conference of February
                                6,<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">See <ref target="#d10">Document
                                    10</ref>.</note> particularly as this appeared to be the first
                            time in which he had been willing to engage in questions and answers
                            with the correspondents. We hoped that this custom would continue and
                            that Diem could also be persuaded to make at least occasional informal
                            radio talks. It seemed to us that this might provide an area where our
                            Ambassadors in Saigon could work together.</p>
                        <p>The substance of Diem’s public appearance on the 6th had also been
                            encouraging since it showed that he was seeking to increase the
                            coordination and efficiency of his government and to increase the
                            participation of various groups such as the peasants (demonstrated by
                            his plans for electing youths to village councils and the eventual
                            creation of district and village councils) as well as by the creation of
                            councils which were designed to attract the intellectuals and the
                            businessmen.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in terms of Diem’s security, we felt it essential for him to
                            seek some improvement in his relations with <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> in order to achieve at least a minimum
                            of border control. Here again there might be room for joint efforts
                            between the American, British and French Ambassadors in Saigon and
                            possibly in Phnom Penh. We felt such efforts could best be arranged in
                            the field.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName>Hood</persName> expressed his government’s interest in the
                            counterinsurgency plan and indicated that the British, on the basis of
                            their Malayan experience, hoped to be able to cooperate. They would
                            appreciate receiving fuller information on the plan. It was indicated
                            that we would give them more on this as the situation developed.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName>Hood</persName> felt in general that their own
                            appreciation of the over-all situation in Viet-Nam was somewhat more
                            pessimistic than ours, but he was inclined to agree that Diem was at
                            last taking some realistic steps to meet the problems he faced. He
                            agreed that there might well be room for coordination in attempting to
                            persuade President Diem to be more communicative and in encouraging him
                            to improve his relations with Cambodia.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear General Palmer:</hi> I am convinced that
                            implementation of State Limited Distribution Message 1115, March 1,
                            1961, would be counter productive in that it will confuse and will
                            retard the offensive of the Government of Vietnam against the Viet Cong
                            which is finally getting underway. For this reason, I am enclosing a
                            copy of a letter which I wrote Admiral <persName corresp="#p_HRALC1">Heinz</persName>, Director, Far East Region, OASD, International
                            Security Affairs, which bears directly on the problem.<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Not printed. In this six-page letter, dated February

                                opposing the Department of State position.</note></p>
                        <p>I sincerely hope Defense is not stampeded into going along with the
                            referenced State message as, contrary to its contention, it is counter
                            to the approved Counter-Insurgency Plan in significant respects. We
                            already have the approved overall Operations Plan for driving the Viet
                            Cong from Vietnam which the message directs and parts of it are already
                            underway. What we need now is time to implement our present sound plans
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-not directives to make major
                            changes. It must also be understood that neither <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> or the Ambassador can direct the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to follow our recommendations-we
                            can only work through persuasion and advice.</p>
                        <p>Under the provisions of the Military Assistance Program and the authority
                            of the Ambassador stated as a qualification to United States approval
                            given the Counter-Insurgency Plan for Vietnam, military aid and other
                            support can be withheld or withdrawn from the Government of Vietnam for
                            noncompliance with certain requirements. This kind of action could, of
                            course, lead to a weakening of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            military action, would allow further Viet Cong successes, be dangerous
                            to our position in Southeast Asia and be at variance with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s announced intention
                            to hold Vietnam. Therefore, our decision-making people will probably

                            of the Counter-Insurgency Plan by Ambassador
                                <persName>Durbrow</persName> to President Diem on February
                                13th,<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">See <ref target="#d11">Document
                                    11</ref>.</note> I was encouraged by our apparent unity of
                            interests and the likelihood that the plan in its entirety would prove
                            substantially acceptable to your government.</p>
                        <p>My conversation with President Diem on Monday, March 6th,<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">A memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>’s conversation with Diem on March 6 and the
                                aide-memoire which he presented to the President were transmitted in
                                despatch 422 from Saigon, March 23. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 751K.5/3-2361)</note> bore out my feeling that he was
                            favorably inclined to adopting the plan substantially as presented.
                            Staff discussions on the proposed implementation of the plan have cast
                            some doubt as to the understanding by your government of certain
                            important military provisions of the Counter-Insurgency Plan which
                            presumably had been agreed upon. These together are of such magnitude
                            that their rejection would in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s
                            professional military opinion negate much of the plan’s required
                            effectiveness. I am most anxious that none of the several actions
                            contemplated by the plan, particularly those which would involve <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support, be taken piece meal until
                            agreement has been reached on the military portion of the
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan as a whole.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you realize that effectiveness of the plan will depend to a
                            large extent on the equipment and supplies for the forces including the
                            20,000 <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> augmentation and the 32,000
                            Civil <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0067"/>Guard. I am unable, as you
                            were informed by the Ambassador, to order any <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> materials for these forces in spite of the long
                            procurement lead time and consequent delayed arrivals involved, until
                            formal agreement on the complete Counter-Insurgency Plan has been
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>Among the major military provisions of the plan which I feel necessary
                            and hope will be found acceptable to your government, are the following: <list>

                                    would give the military responsibility without commensurate

                                    Colonel Liem of your office has dispelled your apprehensions as

                            success or failure in the fight against the Viet Cong rests on mutual
                            understanding and agreement on the wise and early resolution of

                            their inclusion in the plan are not fully understood, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> would welcome the opportunity for
                            further discussion of these points with you or your staff.</p>
                        <p>I would also hope that before final actions are taken by your government
                            on the important military provisions of the plan, we may be advised of
                            the nature of these actions in order that any differences between your

                        <p>The President directed that we see what we can do to speed this up. He

                            he asked why the man couldn't go directly from Paris to Viet-Nam and get

                        <p>I offered that the man had to stop in Washington for his debriefing on

                            speed up the operation so that it isn't the first of June before he is

                            comprehensive Counter-Insurgency Plan (<gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>). From my conversation 11th with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> (reftel) General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers have come to basic oral agreement with

                            acceptance main military <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> suggestions
                            which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> considers it can live with
                            provided <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> follows through with proper
                            implementation. However as <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> position
                            on several other fundamental <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>
                            suggestions was not yet clear, I decided to take up directly with Diem.
                            Following summary conversation:</p>
                        <p>I opened conversation by stating expected go Bangkok end of month to see
                            Secretary who would surely ask me full details re <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction to <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>. Since it imperative we work out agreed plan in some
                            detail and this will take time, I urged Diem to nominate competent
                            military and civilian officials with power of decision to go over our
                            plan with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and embassy officers in
                            order to come to agreement on plan and avoid any future
                            misunderstanding. Since I will leave for Bangkok in about 10 days, I
                            urged Diem nominate his <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0070"/>officials
                            soonest so that group can get together in hope that I would be in
                            position to inform Secretary agreed plan worked out. Diem assured me
                            would do this and reaffirmed it just before I left.</p>
                        <p>I stated I was pleased learn <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had
                            come to basic agreement with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on
                            military aspects <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> and that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had assured me of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agreement on many other aspects.
                            Nevertheless, there were still certain important <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> suggestions which should be discussed in detail. I then
                            enumerated following points:</p>
                        <p>(1) We believe it important to attain further national unity that Diem
                            make reasonable offer take one or two non-commie oppositionists into
                            cabinet.</p>
                        <p>(2) I stated we still receiving allegations and rumors about Can Lao
                            party secret activities which, whether true or not, are harmful to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I again urged that party come
                            out in open or dissolve itself and suggested might be worthwhile pass
                            law or issue decree stating against law have any secret parties VietNam,
                            pointing out this would help give legal basis act against various secret
                            parties even covert communist-front organizations.</p>
                        <p>Diem interrupted me at this point to describe what he called favorable
                            evolution among non-communist oppositionists which now taking place. He
                            stated many of those who took part in coup see errors their ways and now
                            realize if they had won they would have only assisted communist
                            take-over. According Diem most oppositionists, whether those arrested
                            because of coup or others, now in process changing their attitude and
                            realize it in national interests they try to work more closely with
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. For this reason too soon to
                            make offer cabinet posts to oppositionists but, without making firm
                            promise, he stated that if some non-commies could agree basic policy
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> he might take them into
                            government after election.</p>
                        <p>He did not directly reply to my Can Lao suggestion but stated that more
                            and more oppositionists and public in general coming to realize
                            allegations and rumors re party are not true. I interjected these
                            developments all more reason why Can Lao Party should come into open or
                            dissolve and why he should seriously make reasonable offers
                            non-communists enter Govt. Diem made no promises.</p>
                        <p>(3) I stated it’s absolutely fundamental for success <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> to have effective central intelligence
                            organization. Diem agreed and stated he had finally decided to appoint
                            Col. Y as head of Central Intelligence. He spoke highly of Y who has
                            good combat record and has done very well in running re-education
                            centers. I expressed hope he would take over duties soonest and Diem
                            stated he now working out details.</p>
                        <p>(4) I pointed out one of most necessary parts of <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> is to have better <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss>
                            relations. I reminded him I had talked to Mau and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> twice and once to him about bad
                            effects of anti-Sihanouk <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0071"/>articles
                            in Saigon Mai,<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">See <ref target="#d11fn4">footnote 4, Document 11</ref>.</note> adding that we convinced
                            these articles probably sparked <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss>
                            tirade against alleged ill treatment Vietnamese-Khmers. Diem said he had
                            sent word to editors of Saigon Mai point out harm they doing by
                            publishing such articles, but editors replied someone had to answer
                            continuing anti-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> press campaign Phnom
                            Penh. I replied while I realized <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had
                            maintained press truce for many months during which anti-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> campaign continued Phnom Penh, it
                            fundamental that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> not permit mere
                            press campaign prevent efforts establish better <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> relations.</p>
                        <p>I reminded Diem General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>
                            convinced it would be almost impossible put down Viet Cong threat unless
                            work out some border control arrangements. I then stated while we too
                            deplored <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> tirade to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, etc., <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should use incident to point out <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> safety and welfare of population in
                            Delta, including Vietnamese-Khmers, endangered by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks and atrocities and therefore in interest of both
                            countries work out border arrangement (Depcirtel 1370<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Circular telegram 1370 discussed reprisals against

                        <p>Diem went into his usual line re impossibility work out arrangement with
                                <persName>Sihanouk</persName>, “who now considers himself world
                            statesman”. He added certain ex-French colonialists, particularly French
                            army captain Vietnamese origin (I think he said Huyen Dinh La), had been
                            permitted by <persName>Sihanouk</persName> to come to Cambodia after
                            November coup to try to stir up <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            opposition. Diem stated other unnamed French colonialists permitted to
                            return Cambodia for same purpose and certain of them in touch with
                            Hanoi. This proved <persName>Sihanouk</persName> did not wish good
                            relations. Diem then said when Pinay<note n="5" xml:id="d20fn5">Antoine
                                Pinay, Independent Deputy in the French National Assembly.</note>
                            here recently he had pointed this out to him and given details re <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> sanctuary Cambodia and Pinay had taken
                            matter up with <persName>Sihanouk</persName> urging it very much <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> interests prevent <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> using its territory since if <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> should take over <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> would be next
                            target. After <persName>Sihanouk</persName> had put on tirade against
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, particularly treatment
                            Vietnamese Khmers, Pinay—according to Diem—told
                                <persName>Sihanouk</persName> he was “spitting in his own soup” by
                            not trying have better <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> relations.
                            Incidentally he mentioned in passing Ho Thong Minh trying stir trouble
                            by talking Gen. Lawton Collins. Diem then stated recently province chief
                            Kien Tuong had informally met with opposite <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> province chief in effort collaborate. According
                                Diem,<gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> province chief shortly
                            thereafter removed. I replied this unfortunate but matter cannot be
                            arranged at local level as it must be worked out with
                                <persName>Sihanouk</persName>. Diem said that Vice President
                                <persName>Tho</persName> had informally been in contact with friends
                            who were <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> ministers in effort to try
                            to <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0072"/>encourage negotiations. Diem
                            added these efforts got nowhere because <persName>Sihanouk</persName>
                            opposed. I again reiterated no matter <gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> provocation it essential in fight against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to have better relations. Diem made no
                            promises.</p>
                        <p>(I took occasion discussion Saigon Mai articles to say I very concerned
                            series of recent Saigon Mai articles stating “Americans” in touch with
                            presidential candidate Truyen and while articles did not say official
                            Americans they inferred as much. I stated such inference harmful all
                            concerned and urged Diem use this false information as another lever to
                            stop Saigon Mai anti-<gloss target="#t_RKG1">RKG</gloss> attacks. Diem
                            replied editors probably motivated by “evidence” Truyen and presidential
                            candidate that have been showing local press consisting several pictures
                            these two candidates at social gatherings with “Americans”. Diem
                            deplored this harmful publicity and promised to try stop it.)</p>
                        <p>(5) I stated pleased note several press code bills before assembly and
                            urged one be passed soonest. Diem promised to do this and asked whether
                            I did not believe press here now more active in criticism, etc. Replied
                            I pleased this development which very helpful.</p>
                        <p>(6) Stated I also pleased learn press would be permitted be present when
                            ministers interrogated by assembly commissions (reftel) and urged press
                            be encouraged publish details assembly debates, particularly when
                            several bills being discussed on same subject. Diem replied press free
                            to attend all assembly meetings but subjects so dry they have no public
                            appeal. I agreed but urged press be encouraged give details so some of
                            public would be better informed pros and cons important questions.</p>
                        <p>(7) I again urged he make modest payments to peasants called upon furnish
                            labor, particularly those for instance who work on agrovilles but would
                            not live there and would thus get no benefit from their labor. Diem
                            replied peasants everywhere except those in Cochin-China area gladly
                            contributed to community development. He added if he tried to tax them
                            it would cause more disgruntlement. He argued even those who did not get
                            into agrovilles received considerable benefits from establishment nearby
                            markets, schools, hospitals and maternity wards. I stated that while
                            this undoubtedly true, corvee labor was one of principal things used by
                            communists to cause disgruntlement Delta.</p>
                        <p>(8) I then asked whether elections of youth to village councils
                            proceeding and whether internal security councils at provincial and
                            district levels being established. He replied he has given strict orders
                            youth elections be fully democratic since this first step in electoral
                            process to be implemented later on broader scale and therefore public
                            must be assured these honest elections. He corrected me by saying his
                            plan did not call for internal security councils at provincial and
                            district level but would be purely provincial councils, not <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0073"/>necessarily limited to internal
                            security. He would not implement this part of reform until after
                            election since he could be accused using councils to back his campaign.
                            I stated <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> called for lower level
                            internal security councils as well. He promised think this over.</p>
                        <p>(9) I asked when he would implement other reforms announced February 6th.
                            He had same answer that to appoint ministers and others, including
                            members national economic council, before elections could be used by
                            opposition to say he appointing his supporters to help in campaign. He
                            pointed out he desires Vice President <persName>Tho</persName> to take
                            other functions but it would hurt his campaign with business community
                            if he changed from national economy to some other ministry before
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>(10) I then urged Diem to put into practice many psychological warfare
                            suggestions in <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>, particularly those
                            which would induce <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>’s to desert. He
                            said he doing this to certain extent but had to be careful because of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> reprisals against relatives. He
                            added he nevertheless has chosen several ex-VC’s who will make public
                            statements against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>’s just before
                            elections.</p>

                            Again before giving full green light believe we should await outcome

                        <p>At the request of the Government of VietNam, the Secretary had a talk
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> for 50 minutes in
                            the evening of March 27.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary opened the discussion by stating he was pleased that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> could take the trouble
                            to come to Bangkok to discuss Vietnamese problems with him, since he
                            unfortunately could not spare the time to visit Saigon. The Secretary
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> to extend his
                            best wishes to President Diem which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> promised to do.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then stated he wished to
                            discuss two matters: 1) the situation in VietNam and 2) the Vietnamese
                            Government’s concern regarding Lao developments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said it was unfortunate that the
                            world in general did not realize the seriousness of the Viet Cong
                                (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>) activities and threat in
                            VietNam. Often foreign correspondents praised the progress being made in
                            VietNam in the economic and agricultural fields but usually they
                            emphasized the lack of democratic freedoms in his country. These
                            correspondents failed to realize that VietNam is an under-developed
                            country both economically and politically, and they seem to ignore the
                            fact that since the end of 1959 the Viet Cong have changed their tactics
                            from subversion and persuasion to all-out guerilla terrorism. The Viet
                            Cong have increased the number of trained cadre coming from the north
                            and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> (North Vietnam) have
                            announced publicly that they are doing all they can to overthrow the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (South Vietnam) in order to
                            prevent economic progress and set up a weak Communist front <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0075"/>government in order to unify the country
                            under the Viet Cong. For these reasons President Diem cannot put into
                            effect all the democratic freedoms, but as the Viet Cong threat
                            diminishes and the people become educated and more sophisticated
                            democracy can make progress.</p>
                        <p>To emphasize this point, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            reported a conversation that Mr. <persName>G. Menon</persName>, the
                            Indian Chairman of the International Control Commission (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>), had had with Gen. Giap, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Chief of Staff. According to Menon,
                            Giap recently told him that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            desired to get rid of the Diem regime and replace it with a “friendly”
                            government in order that the latter could carry out the provisions of
                            the Geneva Accords to unite North and South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> interpreted Giap’s statement to
                            mean that the latter desired to set up a front government in South
                            Vietnam which in fact would be fully Communist controlled.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then reminded the Secretary
                            that President Diem and his entire government are 100 percent
                            anti-Communists and have, during the last 7 years, cooperated fully with
                            the free world and done all they could to prevent the Communists from
                            taking over South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            added very few in the free world realized that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is actually at war. To point this up,
                            he stated that between two and three hundred South Vietnamese troops
                            were being killed each month and many more civilians were being killed
                            by Viet Cong terrorists. He continued, very few on the outside realized
                            that the Viet Cong occupied practically the entire countryside in South
                            Vietnam for ten years prior to 1954. During this time, they
                            indoctrinated a large part of the population with Communist ideas,
                            kidnapped a lot of South Vietnamese youth when they moved north under
                            the Geneva Accords and many soldiers in the Viet Cong Army are married
                            to South Vietnamese or are the brothers or sons of people from that
                            area. Because of this fact, the Viet Cong are able to bring strong
                            pressure on relatives in the south to collaborate with them. When
                            President Diem took over the government in 1954 from the French, the
                            latter only controlled the main towns and the main highways. For that
                            reason, Diem had to exert a great deal of effort and energy from 1954 to
                            1956 to regain control of the countryside and generally stabilize the
                            internal security. From 1956 to 1959 considerable progress was made in
                            economic and agricultural development and basically for this reason the
                            Viet Cong in late 1959 changed their tactics and are now trying to
                            prevent further progress.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then referred to the
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan (<gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>) which we
                            presented to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> some six weeks ago.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stated that in recent
                            meetings in Saigon, American and Vietnamese experts had come to
                            substantial agreement on the U.S. plan as presented. While the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> agreed basically with the plan, they
                            were very much <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0076"/>concerned by the
                            fact that the plan would require them to meet all the piaster expenses.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> continued, that by
                            extraordinary efforts such as putting in new taxes, collecting old taxes
                            more effectively and by making arrangements with local banks to float a
                            government loan, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be able
                            to meet most of the piaster costs of the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> for calendar year 1961. He added, however, that
                            although the banks had agreed to try to float the loan, they had
                            insisted that half of the loan should be used for economic development
                            purposes instead of entirely for military counter insurgency
                            expenditures. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then said
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> frankly did not know how it
                            could raise sufficient piasters for calendar year 1962 to pay the cost
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>. He said one of the reasons
                            for this was that the “Buy American” program and the U.S. insistence
                            that all aid shipments be made in U.S. ships would, in fact, reduce the
                            effective amount of U.S. aid by 30 percent in the future. He backed his
                            arguments about the piaster shortage by quoting from statements made to
                            him by the Brookings-Ford Foundation financial expert team now in
                            Vietnam. According to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, the
                            team experts after several months’ study came to the conclusion that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not raise more taxes
                            without raising prices or causing a fairly serious inflation. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> added the reason prices had so
                            far not gone up more, although heavier taxes had recently been imposed,
                            is that there have been sufficient stocks of consumers goods in the
                            country to meet the basic demands. Once these stocks are exhausted,
                            there is bound to be a shortage and inflation. The financial experts
                            also told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that before an
                            accurate figure could be set for the devaluation of the piaster, it
                            would be necessary to make a careful study of the entire Vietnamese
                            price structure. The experts believed that until this is done it would
                            be wrong to set the new piaster rate at 60 to the dollar since this
                            might cause serious disruption of the economy, stop progress, and might
                            cause further inflation, unless it turned out to be the right rate. The
                            experts said it would take them about 5 months more to complete the
                            price structure study. For this reason, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not accept the suggestion in the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> that as a last resort the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could devalue in order to obtain
                            sufficient piasters for their counter insurgency needs. He admitted that
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had earned comparatively large
                            amounts of foreign exchange in 1960 and had fairly large reserves.
                            However, because of the Buy American policy and their extraordinary
                            expenditures in connection with the fight against the Viet Cong, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had to spend a comparatively
                            large amount of this exchange for necessary imports.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then thanked the Secretary
                            for approving the force increase of 20,000 men which were [was] urgently
                            needed to give adequate protection to the population now seriously
                            harassed by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. In view of the fact
                            that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are stepping up their attacks
                                <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0077"/>prior to the coming
                            presidential elections in April, he, Minister of Defense, had given firm
                            orders to all security forces to go on and continue on the offensive.
                            While these tactics were effective, they were causing considerable
                            losses on both sides. He added that the despite [sic] the all-out effort
                            that must be made to fight the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, it is
                            also essential to carry on as much economic and agricultural development
                            as possible under the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> for
                            his explanation of the situation and assured him that the United States
                            Government would give as much assistance to Vietnam as it can to fight
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat and maintain its
                            independence and integrity. He then asked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> whether the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            had any long-range development plans. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that they had a three-year plan which is
                            being carried out as best it can be under the present circumstances. He
                            pointed out that one of the main objectives of the plan is to bring
                            about a gradual devaluation of the currency. Despite the efforts made in
                            this field, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stated that he
                            disagreed with the U.S. contention in the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for
                            various reasons could not usefully absorb any more aid. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> admitted that if the present list
                            of goods which can be imported through U.S. aid is maintained and if the
                            Buy American policy remained in effect, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> might not be able to use even all the U.S. aid
                            available for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61. He contended,
                            however, that if <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> would revise the
                            list of commodities paid for by American aid, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could not only use all the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61 aid money but a considerably larger
                            amount. In this connection, he agreed that the present US balance of
                            payments criterion for aid would have merit if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was not confronted by a serious <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat. Under the circumstances, however,
                            exceptions should be made to the balance of payments approach in order
                            to permit the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to obtain enough
                            piasters to implement the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> emphasized that one of the
                            principal needs was to give security protection to the people in the
                            countryside who were being constantly harassed, propagandized and
                            intimidated by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This costs a great
                            deal. He added that this extra aid is needed until the many factories
                            now being built or in production can produce enough goods to meet the
                            consumers’ needs and if these needs are not met, serious inflation will
                            ensue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary again thanked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            for his full explanation and assured him of continued US support. He
                            added that President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>
                            himself had personally approved the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>.
                            The new administration, however, has found it necessary to study
                            carefully the methods and results of US aid programs in the past 15
                            years in order to find out what mistakes had been made and which methods
                            had proved most efficacious. The administration believes that, in the
                            past, there were too many short term plans and projects which, as good
                            as they may have been, were not aimed at long range goals in <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0078"/>individual countries. For these reasons,
                            the Administration is asking the Congress to make available funds for
                            longer periods of time. If this is granted, not only can the United
                            States plan ahead but it is essential that each individual country put
                            into effect their own long range plans to attain desired goals ten years
                            hence and then draw up plans to work on projects each year which would
                            lead to these goals.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that economic and military aid will do no good if
                            efforts are not made simultaneously to explain to the people what the
                            government is doing, the goals they hope to attain and the sacrifices
                            needed. This is particularly essential in countries fighting Communist
                            “promise.” The Secretary then urged that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> do all it can to better its international relations,
                            particularly with countries in its own area. He mentioned such countries
                            as India and Burma. He stated unless these countries are aware of
                            Vietnam’s problems, what they are doing about it and how they hope to
                            attain their desired goals and explain to them the seriousness of the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat, these countries will
                            neither understand the plight of Vietnam nor do anything to help the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The Secretary stated it is
                            essential also to fill in the foreign press on these same problems.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>, the Secretary
                            stated it is essential that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            establish as soon as possible an effective chain of military command in
                            order that the security forces may be used as effectively as possible in
                            the battle against the Communists. If the country does not use all its
                            resources, military, political, psychological and economic, to best
                            advantage, it will be difficult if not impossible to overcome the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> thanked the Secretary for
                            his explanations of the Administration’s point-of-view and stated that
                            shortly after the elections the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            expects to have <persName corresp="#p_TAR1">Tunku Abdel
                                Rahman</persName> and Gen. Nasution visit Vietnam in order to
                            strengthen relations with these neighbors. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is also endeavoring to build up its prestige in Africa,
                            but this is proving difficult because of what: they term the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s “Operation Checkbook”. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> explained that the Chinese
                            National Foreign Minister had explained to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Foreign Minister recently that in connection with
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> efforts to win friends in Africa
                            one of the African leaders asked how much the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> could give in aid and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Ambassador promised to inquire into the matter. Shortly
                            thereafter, the Chinese Communist Ambassador was asked the same question
                            and when given the answer, he was presented with a check immediately by
                            the Communist representative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> interjected, to remind <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that part of the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> called for serious efforts by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to better its relations with
                            Cambodia. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, citing how
                            difficult this is, stated hat the Vice President had had discussions
                            with the Cambodian Foreign Minister just the day <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0079"/>before and it was hoped that these talks
                            would lead to good results. In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> particularly commented on the
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> campaign recently mounted
                            in Phnom Penh in connection with the alleged flight of hundreds of
                            Vietnamese of Cambodian origin to Cambodia. He decided it was too bad
                            that this Viet Cong organized incident had caused so much difficulty. He
                            then referred to the Cambodian Assembly resolution of March 24 which was
                            particularly derogatory to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            stated that he was pleased to have been told by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> that it was quite evident that
                            this resolution had been written and pushed through by the Communist
                            elements. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stated that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is making extraordinary efforts
                            to have better international press relations and reminded the Secretary
                            of the rather sweeping governmental reforms Diem has already announced.
                            He added that most of these reforms would be put into effect by April
                            15, a few days after the presidential election.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> spoke for only a minute or
                            two about Laos, indicating that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            was naturally deeply concerned about the prospects of the country going
                            Communist and stated that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            supports the Boun Oum Government. He expressed concern about growing
                            reports that the Viet Cong are coming through the passes from North
                            VietNam into Laos to create bases in the Southeastern part of that
                            country which are being used for attacks into VietNam.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Secretary thanked <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> again for his clear expose of the situation in
                            VietNam. The Secretary then said that the Administration is endeavoring
                            to speed up procedures and decisions; therefore, he suggested that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> discuss these problems
                            frankly and fully with Mr. <persName>Nolting</persName>, the
                            Ambassador-Designate to VietNam, a man of proven ability who will be
                            very understanding. The Secretary again assured <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that we appreciate fully the
                            anti-Communist stand of the Diem Government and we will do all we can to
                            help, but our efforts must be mutual.</p>

                            <item>Most Southeast Asian countries are either now experiencing or will
                                encounter in the next year or two serious political crises arising
                                out of foreign intervention, domestic strains, or a complex of
                                factors attributable to their basically unstable and unhealthy
                                political, social, and economic structure. By far the most serious
                                problems are the deteriorating situation in Laos and the mounting
                                Communist threat and precarious governmental situation in South
                                Vietnam. (Paras. 22-68)</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The Pathet Lao probably have a greater military capability than
                                they have yet chosen to exercise. They could sharply step up the
                                action at any time and probably achieve a series of local victories.
                                This would increase the likelihood of the disintegration of the
                                Laotian Army and the subsequent collapse of the non-Communist
                                position. The Laotian crisis has become a matter of contention among
                                the major powers and its resolution rests primarily in non-Laotian
                                hands. (Paras. 28-30)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>In South Vietnam, the situation of the Diem government seems
                                likely to become increasingly difficult, not only because of rising
                                Communist guerrilla strength and declining internal security but
                                also because of widening dissatisfaction with Diem’s government.
                                Since the coup attempt of November 1960, Diem has reasserted <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0081"/>his control of the government
                                and made some cautious moves toward government reform; he has taken
                                action to improve the antiguerrilla capabilities of the army and
                                stepped up military activities against the Viet Cong. Nonetheless,
                                the factors which gave rise to the November 1960 coup attempt still
                                exist, and we believe that the odds favor another coup attempt by
                                non-Communist elements in the next year or so. The Communists would
                                attempt to exploit any new efforts to unseat the government. We are
                                not confident that the army would be able to keep the situation from
                                getting out of hand. (Paras. 36-38)</item>

                            <item>There is deep awareness among the countries of Southeast Asia that
                                developments in the Laotian crisis, and its outcome, have a profound
                                impact on their future. The governments of the area tend to regard
                                the Laotian crisis as a symbolic test of intentions, wills, and
                                strengths between the major powers of the West and the Communist
                                Bloc. (Para. 69)</item>

                            <item>Those countries which are in close alignment with the US favor
                                stronger measures to assure at least a non-Communist and preferably
                                an anti-Communist, western-oriented regime in Laos; neutralist Burma
                                and Cambodia, as well as Malaya, favor a neutralist but not
                                Communist-dominated government. These latter governments favor some
                                form of international political agreement to end the crisis. They
                                would be alarmed if Laos were lost under conditions which indicated
                                to them that the US position in the area had gravely weakened.

                            <item>The loss of Laos to the Communists, or perhaps even the division
                                of the country, would almost certainly incline the Thai toward
                                accommodation to Communist power in Southeast Asia. A predominantly
                                Communist-controlled Laos would vitally threaten South Vietnam’s
                                independence: it would greatly extend the Communist frontiers with
                                South Vietnam; it would bring substantially greater Communist
                                military power to bear on the crucial Saigon defense complex; and it
                                would greatly facilitate Communist infiltration and subversion. The
                                close proximity of a Communist state would make more difficult
                                Western efforts to starch up local resistance. In short, the loss of
                                Laos would severely damage the US position and its influence in
                                Thailand and South Vietnam. (Para. 72)</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>The future course of all of the countries of Southeast Asia would
                                be strongly influenced by the actual circumstances in which the loss
                                or division of Laos had occurred as well as the local appraisal of
                                the attitude and actions of the US in response to the situation. The
                                extent to which these countries would go in resisting Bloc pressures
                                or in withstanding local Communist threats would depend in great
                                degree on whether they still assessed that the US could stem further
                                Communist expansion in the area. They would <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0082"/>feel more keenly than before a
                                strong temptation to take a neutral position between the two power
                                blocs, even though they recognized that the US is the only country
                                with sufficient power to oppose the Communist Bloc in the area.
                                Although they probably would be deeply disillusioned regarding US
                                resolution after the loss or division of Laos, they would
                                nonetheless welcome demonstrations of US firmness and might in
                                response modify their appraisal of their own future in due course.

                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>Although the Communist threat to South Vietnam has reached serious
                                proportions, the chances of a Communist takeover in the next year or
                                so are considerably less than they are in Laos. Nevertheless,
                                Peiping and Hanoi almost certainly attach greater importance to
                                their efforts in South Vietnam than they do to their efforts in
                                Laos. US prestige and policy are particularly deeply engaged in
                                South Vietnam. Diem’s policy of close alignment with the US is on
                                trial in the current crisis. All countries of the area would attach
                                great importance to a failure of the South Vietnam Government to
                                cope successfully with the rising tempo of Communist subversion and
                                armed insurrection. If South Vietnam were to fall to the Communists
                                or be forced to swing toward neutralism, the impact upon the
                                countries of Southeast Asia would be similar in kind but
                                considerably more severe than that resulting from the loss or
                                division of Laos. (Para. 74)</item>

                                fully exploited in the counter-guerrilla program of the Vietnamese?
                                The helicopter is uniquely effective in tracking down
                                guerrillas.”</p>

                                interested in the counter-guerrilla problem there and is well aware
                                of the importance of helicopters in a counter-guerrilla role.

                                in counter-guerrilla operations. The Vietnamese armed forces now
                                have 14 H19 helicopters. The current military aid program includes
                                an additional 11 H34’s, which were asked for for the specific
                                purpose of use in counterguerrilla warfare. Ten of these H34’s have
                                actually been delivered and the remaining one will be delivered in

                                him that the total of 25 helicopters appeared to be about all that
                                the Vietnamese could effectively use and maintain. However, General

                            <p>Question 2. “Why were the Special Warfare units withdrawn from
                                Vietnam in November 1960? Why are they not being sent back to work
                                with our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> there? General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">Decker</persName>, when asked,
                                indicated that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> had
                                opposed. Why?”</p>
                            <p>There have been two basic problems in properly training the South
                                Vietnamese in counter-guerrilla activities. The first of these
                                involved both U.S. organization and the manner by which President
                                Diem of Vietnam had organized his own forces. Until quite recently
                                the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was responsible for
                                counter-guerrilla training of only the regular armed forces of
                                Vietnam. The <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>) was responsible for training the
                                Vietnamese Civil Guard and police. Further, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was responsible for training in guerrilla warfare.
                                President Diem, on his part, has in the past been trying to conduct
                                counter-guerrilla operations almost personally and with a
                                complicated fragmentation of responsibilities in the lower levels.
                                The conduct of operations in any particular area which involved
                                primarily local resources, including the Civil Guard and police,
                                were supposedly coordinated by the political head of the area. If
                                regular armed forces were involved, the operations were supposedly
                                coordinated by the military region commander. During the past year,
                                however, great progress has been made both in the simplification of
                                U.S. responsibilities and in the Vietnamese organization. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam developed a
                                comprehensive Counter-insurgency Plan<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4"><ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> which was
                                finally approved by <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0085"/>the
                                Country Team and later in Washington. At the same time, President
                                Diem-despite the fact that he has not yet agreed to all aspects of
                                the Counter-insurgency Plan-has moved forward considerably and has
                                assigned primary responsibility for counter-guerrilla action to the
                                Ministry of Defense and has also put training of the Civil Guard
                                under the same Ministry. This has greatly facilitated <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> training in this field.</p>
                            <p>The second complicating problem has been the limitation in numbers on
                                the size of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam, deriving
                                from the “legal” requirements of the Geneva settlement of Indochina
                                in 1954. The settlement permits no increase in foreign military in
                                Vietnam above the number there at the time the settlement was made.
                                It has been the U.S. position for the past years that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> should not exceed 685.
                                Conceivably the figure could be recomputed now because of reduction
                                in the French military there</p>
                            <p>In March 1960 the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, noting the
                                deteriorating situation in Vietnam, offered <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam through the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> a
                                “Cold War Task Force,” consisting of 156 Special Forces personnel
                                and 19 Civil Affairs, psychological and intelligence specialists.
                                However, because of the personnel ceilings on the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, mentioned above, only 30 U.S.
                                Army Special Forces personnel could be accepted of the overall
                                proposed Task Force. Teams of these Special Forces personnel were
                                used to instruct elements of the Vietnamese armed forces in
                                counter-guerrilla warfare during the period May through November
                                1960. As Vietnamese instructors were trained, they assisted each
                                Special Forces team and gradually assumed a larger share of
                                instruction as they became qualified. Since becoming fully qualified
                                these Vietnamese instructors have been working under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam supervision to continue
                                training of others in their specialties. As we understand it, this
                                training is moving ahead quite effectively and the training load is
                                being adequately carried.</p>
                            <p>Because of the current limitation on the size of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, Vietnam, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> must carefully balance
                                the makeup of his personnel against his over-all training
                                requirements. However, he is now in the process of reassessing the
                                situation and will report if he believes more Special Forces type
                                personnel are needed and can be accommodated within the ceiling.
                                Presuming that the current ceiling is not changed, it is possible
                                that it could be evaded by various subterfuges, but it has so far
                                been the policy of the Country Team to require the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to remain within its ceiling.</p>
                            <p>The Cold War Task Force of the size originally offered by the Army in
                                1960 is still available for employment in South Vietnam if
                                desired.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> replied that he was
                            particularly happy to have the chance to explain to the Ambassador
                            because the developments had a very vital bearing on his country’s
                            interests. He said that in one conversation with our British colleagues
                            we had tried to focus our attention on the larger issue of security in
                            Southeast Asia as a whole. We had dramatized to them the fact that the
                            place where more of our friends were being directly attacked and killed
                            by the Communists was in VietNam. We informed them of the things we
                            intended to do in VietNam, our plans for stepped-up assistance, etc.
                            They were interested, sympathetic, and cooperative.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador wanted to know if we had an understanding about what
                            should be done.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> in reply reviewed the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Conference saying that the
                            members faced up to the fact that they must assume their
                            responsibilities. For example, M. Manach, the French representative,
                            certainly left the meeting with a full understanding that responsibility
                            lay with the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> process if there
                            were no settlement. Thailand and the Philippines both felt content with
                            the decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> then stated that we
                            now have the problem of attempting to find a peaceful solution. Since we
                            are afraid to attend an international conference while military activity
                            continues, we <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0087"/>have taken a firm
                            stand that a cease-fire must be de facto in effect. As to the current
                            situation, we are disturbed that one prong of the <gloss target="#t_PL2">PL</gloss> near Paksane is close to cutting Laos in two. On the
                            other hand, two days ago the Government of Laos dropped paratroops at
                            Muong Kassy.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then urged that it was necessary to keep on fighting and
                            defending to the last moment; he was encouraged to see that our side had
                            not stopped before the conference. He then addressed himself to an item
                            from the press which he thought needed comment:</p>
                        <p>Chinese troops. He had been disturbed by editorials which cited the
                            danger that Chinese troops would enter the conflict. He thought that the
                            press misunderstood the fact that Red China, the USSR, the Pathet Lao,
                            and the Viet-Minh were all fingers on the same hand. The Chinese do not
                            have to send troops directly into Laos because Communist cadres have
                            been trained in North VietNam for the last fifteen years. The enemy can
                            inject this nucleus into Laos with no trouble at all because they speak
                            the same language, have trained with the Pathet Lao, etc. He recalled
                            that he had seen Souphanouvong in Hanoi in 1945 when he attended a
                            meeting to help in the organization of Viet-Minh in Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then urged the necessity of having more troops in VietNam;
                            not American Marines, but Asiatics who know the terrain. He thought that
                            the US understood the military situation very well but had hesitated for
                            years on an increase in the Vietnamese army. He then asked for
                            confirmation if it were correct that we had recently given his country
                            an offer of help of $41 million, on condition that the Vietnamese make a
                            counter effort which he said would involve 1,500 million piastres. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> confirmed this. The
                            Ambassador closed with an eloquent plea for help of various kinds saying
                            that his people were still ready and willing to fight to defend
                            themselves. He said that his government was glad to make reforms such as
                            land reforms, etc., but he was afraid that reforms would be ineffectual
                            unless they were backed up in depth with means of resettlement, farm
                            machinery, etc., intimating that the US could help along other
                            lines.</p>

                                        apparently feels it cannot provide the financial support
                                        required in the Counterinsurgency Plan. Furthermore, the
                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that prompt acceptance of the
                                        Counterinsurgency Plan by the Government of Vietnam is a
                                        matter of overriding concern in that country’s present
                                        critical situation. Therefore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                        request the Secretary of Defense to take action to the end
                                        that Defense Support funds are provided for a 170,000 man

                        <p>In reporting on the Vietnamese elections, Mr.
                                <persName>Jenkins</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2"> Alfred LeS. Jenkins. Bureau of Far Eastern
                                Affairs, Department of State.</note> remarked that they could be
                            considered a significant victory for President Diem. An analysis of the
                            returns indicate that he was able to hold the countryside in spite of
                            Viet-Cong actions. Countrywide, there had been a turnout of about 90%.
                            On the other hand, in Saigon the turnout was only 75%. Diem had received
                            about 89% of the votes, but in Saigon he had received only 64%. This was
                            probably due to <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0093"/>the fact that
                            opposition candidates were better known in the urban areas. There was no
                            evidence of any blatant frauds in the election.</p>
                        <p>From a security point of view, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            armed forces had done surprisingly well. Though the Viet-Cong had
                            attacked at several points, the situation was kept under control by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> countermeasures and the
                            Viet-Cong efforts had had little effect on the vote.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName> remarked that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> had begun to release a good deal more
                            information on Viet-Cong activities and the Government’s own
                            countermeasures. There had been an increase in our own press reporting
                            on insurgency activities in Vietnam, but this probably resulted largely
                            from the presence of a good number of press people in Vietnam who were
                            essentially there to cover the elections.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Russell <note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Admiral James S. Russell,
                                Deputy Chief of Naval Operations.</note> asked whether we are really
                            supporting Diem and, if so, in view of his election victory, shouldn't
                            we publicly affirm our support for him. Mr. <persName>Jenkins</persName>
                            reported that we do continue to support Diem and that the Department is
                            trying to arrange for President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to send a personal message to President Diem at
                            the time of the latter’s inauguration.</p>
                        <p>In connection with Admiral Russell’s query, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> noted that in the next several
                            weeks the Executive Branch will be taking another concerted look at the
                            entire Vietnamese problem. One of the items that must be faced up to is
                            the Geneva Accord as it relates to Vietnam. Current thinking is that we
                            should disengage ourselves from the continued support of and adherence
                            to the Geneva Accords since others are openly violating them. Mr.
                                <persName>Jenkins</persName> remarked that the State Department’s
                            legal people feel that we can probably do so, particularly since we are
                            not signatories to the Accords and since some of the signatory nations
                            are grossly violating them.</p>

                                renewed conviction. Perhaps a visit to the field by a Washington
                                team to see what is going on, is called for. I gather that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> would like to go himself

                                Ambassador, he may have been good. I believe so, but Diem never had
                                to deal with him when he bore the full burden of an Ambassador, with
                                all the awkward inevitable <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0095"/>problems of negotiation. I think we must go with Nolting, whom I
                                know well personally. You will find him a man of rare strength and
                                character. But I am sure we must find a way to send <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> for a visit to VietNam
                                soon in a way that will strengthen Nolting’s hand-not weaken it.
                                This is wholly possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d30fn3">A memorandum to

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said that General

                            the Vice President on his coming trip to VietNam and that this week he

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> said that he
                            would be making side visit to VietNam and would do his best to support
                            the Task Force efforts in the field. He emphasized the need for security
                            to prevent leaks and speculation about this new activity. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said that the President
                            wanted one document similar to that which had been prepared on
                                “Millpond.”<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">Operation Millpond, approved

                                improve the U.S. military posture with respect to Laos.</note> He
                            then called on General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>
                            for a report.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> said that
                            President Diem wanted to see General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> and would like him to stay in VietNam as long
                            as possible. The General then gave a briefing<note n="5" xml:id="d33fn5">For an outline of <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>’s briefing, see <hi rend="italic">Declassified
                                    Documents, 1978</hi>, p. 361B. Two days later, at 9 a.m. on

                                briefing has been found.</note> on the situation stressing that the
                            war in VietNam was vicious and brutal and that casualties were high. The
                            Communists were trying to establish secure areas in the countryside and
                            during 1960 Viet Cong incidents averaged about 505 per month and were
                            highest in September. This year they have been as high as 650 in March
                            but the incidents themselves had not been on quite as large a scale and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now has the initiative. In 1960
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> suffered 3000 casualties. The
                            figures all came from VietNam sources but were considered fairly
                            accurate. At present it was estimated that 42% of the country was under
                            firm <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> control with the rest uncertain
                            degree under Communist control. He felt that the military problem must
                            first be solved before we can move ahead in the psychological, economic
                            and other areas.</p>
                        <p>In describing pare-military operations in VietNam the General spoke of
                            the country team headed by the Ambassador but stressed that all
                            Americans there were merely advisers. He mentioned the Presidential
                            order giving the Ambassador policy coordination control<note n="6" xml:id="d33fn6">For text of Executive Order 10893, November 8, 1960,
                                which, inter alia, defined the coordination and supervision of
                                functions in diplomatic missions abroad, see <hi rend="italic">Code
                                    of Federal Regulations, Title 3—The President—1959-1963
                                    Compilation</hi>, Washington, pp. 420-424.</note> and pointed
                            out that the Ambassador had insisted that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> might send its position to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> only after coordinated by the <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0101"/>Ambassador. This procedure had delayed
                            for as much as 13 days his getting his own views across to his
                            superiors.</p>
                        <p>As for the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>, we were now trying to get
                            full agreement from the Vietnamese. There was no doubt for the need for
                            20,000 more troops. The Ambassador had finally withdrawn his objection
                            for this increase because of the situation in Laos.</p>
                        <p>From the military point of view there was a need for a phased and planned
                            operation under a firm chain of command. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> now had full control of the training of the civil
                            guard 32,000 of whom were financed under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> with the remaining 38,000 to get <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> equipment.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was developing a counterinsurgency
                            doctrine which contained the seeds of an operational plan. As for the
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> there were 125 battalion
                            equivalents 90 of which were fully committed and some had been in
                            operation continuously for one and one-half to two years without
                            training. The additional 20,000 were needed for rotation and to permit
                            training. 65 ranger units and s5 ranger cadres had been trained. By the
                            end of 1965 six ranger groups would have been trained.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked about pay and
                            allowances for the additional 20,000. The General pointed out that the
                            President was annoyed that defense support [which] had been at the rate
                            of $155 million was to be reduced to $90 million based on a balance of
                            payment justification. He pointed out that Diem and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that they can pay for the
                            additional 20,000; in his opinion they could do so to a certain
                            extent.</p>
                        <p>The General said that the situation although dangerous could be dealt
                            with. If the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> substantially stepped up
                            their activity and they have the capability, the situation could become
                            highly critical. He mentioned the covert introduction at Kun Tum of some
                            1000 Viet Minh as well as the strikes that were launched across the
                            Cambodian frontier. He referred to the Khmer problem and to the long
                            standing friction between Diem and <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> as well as the Ambassador’s efforts to get
                            these two together. The best arrangement would be to a military seal
                            along the Cambodian frontier but this could not be done because of vast
                            jungles and swamps. He explained how the problem was more serious and
                            how it differed from those in Malaya and in the Philippines. Obviously
                            if the Communists should get control in southern Laos they could
                            outflank VietNam and for this reason the coming conference will have
                            dangerous possibilities. He did not see any solution with the
                            partitioning of Laos so the southern part could be sealed off.</p>
                        <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said we must do what
                            we can to preserve internal security but must assume that we cannot do
                            too much about the Cambodian and Lao problems. The General said that it
                            was difficult to get the team to work together and that we are unable to
                            get coordinated action in Laos. There was much to do in the paramilitary
                            areas, but nothing would take the place of military force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said he hoped we could
                            resolve the balance of payments issue as applied to the additional force
                            level.</p>
                        <p>The General said that 170,000 would be enough troops and perhaps more
                            than could be taken care of because of lack of officers for the
                            additional 20,000. He said we could hold and mop up with what we have
                            but that it would take 30,000 to keep the border area secure. As for the
                            chain of command, the General pointed out that Big Minh was to be the
                            top commander.</p>
                        <p>There was then a discussion of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            ceiling during which the General pointed out that if <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is to take over other duties there
                            would have to be some increase.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> was called on to
                            comment which he did along the following general lines:<note n="7" xml:id="d33fn7">A summary of <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s remarks, attached to a note from him to

                            of dollars and Vietnamese personnel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said we need to come up with a program for

                        <p>It was agreed that the Task Force would meet again on Wednesday to go

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President:</hi> I wish on the occasion of
                            your second inauguration to offer to you and to the Vietnamese people my
                            personal congratulations and those of the American people. We have
                            watched with sympathy your courageous leadership during your country’s
                            struggle to perfect its independence and its efforts to create a better
                            life for its people. The United States stands firmly with you in this
                            struggle and in these efforts. The recent treaty of amity and economic
                                relations<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">For text of this treaty, signed
                                at Saigon April 3, 1961, see 5 UST 2400.</note> and the inauguration
                            of the Saigon-Bien Hoa highway are symbols of the cooperation between
                            our countries.</p>
                        <p>The progress made under your leadership has caused the Communists to step
                            up their campaign of hatred, terror and destruction by which they seek
                            to further their purposes in Asia. I am encouraged that the
                            Communist-instigated guerrilla war failed to disrupt the elections and
                            that in the midst of a perilous struggle your country was able to
                            conduct a political campaign with frank exchange of opinion. Your
                            leadership has again been nourished and strengthened by the mandate of
                            your people. This augurs well.</p>
                        <p>I look toward a future in which VietNam will be able to pursue the
                            aspirations of its people in peace and freedom. I do not minimize the
                            difficulties your country must pass through, but I am confident because
                            I know that as always in history the cooperation of free men will
                            ultimately triumph over tyranny.</p>
                        <p>It is fitting that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> should be present on this occasion to deliver my
                            message to you, for he has worked tirelessly and with understanding for
                            the common good of our countries. I look forward to his return, when I
                            shall have opportunity to hear from him first hand of his services in
                            your country.</p>

                                Cong did try to oppose the election. They bombed polling booths and

                            Vietnam, indicating that the Task Force Report<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> is
                            only a first draft to be reviewed, reshaped and then carried personally
                            by the Vice President on his trip.</p>
                        <p>1. We need a more realistic look.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that this plan depends on the communists being tied down in
                            Laos or lacking further forces, on our blocking land corridors through
                            which communist support flows, or on our obtaining effective
                            anti-infiltration action from Laos, Cambodia and the Laotian
                            negotiations, the outcome is highly doubtful.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that it depends on wider popular support among the
                            Vietnamese, tax and foreign exchange reforms by Diem, and his agreement
                            to the military and governmental reorganizations required, the outcome
                            is speculative at best.</p>
                        <p>There is no timetable-no clear division of field authority between our
                            new Ambassador and the military, or between U.S. and G.V.N.—and no
                            realistic estimate of long-run costs and effect, with many estimates
                            being omitted altogether. Many miscellaneous ideas are vaguely thrown in
                            without any consideration comparable to that given the military and
                            intelligence build-ups (e.g., a U.N. appeal, a 5-year economic plan, “a
                            long-range plan for the economic development of Southeast Asia on a
                            regional basis,” etc.).</p>
                        <p>2. More importantly, it may be necessary to recast this in terms of a
                            joint plan to be implemented by both countries only after the Vice
                            President and Diem have come to a firm agreement.</p>
                        <p>There is no clearer example of a country that cannot be saved unless it
                            saves itself-through increased popular support; governmental, economic
                            and military reforms and reorganizations; and the encouragement of new
                            political leaders. We do not want Vietnam to fall-we do not want to add
                            to Diem’s burdens-and the chief purpose of insisting upon such
                            conditions should not be saving of American dollars but the saving of
                            Vietnam.</p>

                            of these measures should be substantial, if actually carried out.</p>
                        <p>As usual in such outline plans, there is far more emphasis on what we

                                    too well on selling him those aspects of the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> which call on him to do

                                    This is a lot easier said than done. What quid pro quos do we
                                    offer for <persName>Sihanouk</persName>’s cooperation?</item>
                                <label>(c)</label>
                                <item>If we are bailing Diem out, why aren't we entitled to insist
                                    (Page 6) that he overhaul tax system, halt waste of foreign
                                    exchange and devalue currency to a realistic rate? To my mind
                                    one of the flaws of our Korean operation has been that we always
                                    gave and <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0108"/>never demanded.
                                    This is war for Diem too, he’s got to understand that continued
                                    procrastination on his part will be fatal.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I question whether task force directorship should be in Defense rather
                            than State, although I grant that the instrumentalities to be employed
                            are largely military. We must also remember the face we present to the
                            world, and the precedent we would set.</p>
                        <p>I miss any attention to how we tell the other side that we mean business.
                            It is terribly important, of course, to convince the Communists of this,
                            and to attempt to forestall a parallel intensification of their effort.
                            Here’s a field for quiet diplomacy and even a few private threats.</p>
                        <p>How do we demonstrate our determination in unmistakable terms? At a
                            minimum, why not give Diem now a public commitment that if things get to
                            the stage of overt fighting, we will come to his support. (Like we had
                            to do with <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName>). We should
                            consider ways and means of putting token US forces in South Vietnam as
                            further evidence (if this is possible under Geneva Accords). I know you
                            are already on top of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> angle.</p>
                        <p>One purpose of an explicit US commitment along above lines would be to
                            guarantee <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> border so that <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>’s 170,000 men can be more
                            effectively deployed against Viet Cong. To me, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is not yet on top of problem, but still regards
                            internal threat as secondary. We should have a showdown on this, and if
                            necessary replace <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> chief.</p>
                        <p>Before we get into expensive radar surveillance (Page 5), do we have any
                            evidence of extensive clandestine overflights? I had thought most <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> support came in by land or sea. And don't
                            we need more than a “Junk force” to meet latter?</p>
                        <p>One big headache in Laos has been that our boys won't fight. Should we
                            consider putting <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisers into
                            operations down to battalion, etc. level? This might be more important
                            than anything else. On this score, I can't over-emphasize importance of
                            having the best American personnel; the average <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officer is simply not suited for the type of war we're
                            going to have to fight (<persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> is well aware of this). Instead of just adding
                            on to 685 now there, we must insist on careful screening process!</p>
                        <p>Finally, while immediate focus must be on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> problem, we cannot neglect longer-range objective of a
                            viable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Our purpose is not just to
                            conduct a holding action, but to use the time gained to build a
                            structure which will last. Let’s not have another Korea, where
                            prolongation of primarily military focus long after hostilities were
                            over leaves us (eight years later) with the job of building a viable
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> still in front of us.</p>

                                    guidance from, the State Department.</item>

                                <item>As regards organization in the field, he felt that the
                                    Ambassador and the Country Team should control the timing of the
                                    actions recommended, should have authority to recommend changes
                                    and should negotiate the steps. The Defense member of the Task
                                    Force, if he visited the country, would be subject to the
                                    authority of the Ambassador and would not visit the country
                                    unless asked for by the Ambassador.</item>

                                    The other measures proposed in the State paper should be

                            and procedure, I would recommend that you agree to the Task Force

                            accurately done and some of the measures should be further considered,
                            you too feel that a general approval of the accelerated program of
                            action for VietNam is warranted. If in fact the above points do not come

                        <p>Although this point was not made specifically by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>, it would follow from our

                            inquired on validity of election and seemed surprised that Diem received
                            only 65% of vote in Saigon-Cholon as opposed to 95% in country as a
                            whole which he considered as evidence of non-rigged elections. He again
                            reiterated that U.S. must save <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and
                            with the present situation it could be saved primarily by military
                            means. We must express our requirements clearly, immediately, not

                            limitations, in fact use an over-kill factor. He again referred to
                            possible use of U.S. units in training, logistics, and combat support
                            such as helicopter units. He inquired on intelligence at all
                                levels,<gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and Viet Cong
                            communications, source of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> supplies,

                        <p>4. In separate discussions with Ty and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>
                            stressed time and the lesson to be learned from Laos was the loss of
                            time. While U.S. support in Laos was limited to provision equipment and
                            minimum non-tactical training Pathet Lao-Viet Minh forces were
                            organizing, training, equipping, and moving. He urged required <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> decisions on command structure,
                            intelligence, force increase, and other facets of Counterinsurgency
                            Plan. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> cited <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> financial problems in paying increased
                            forces. He also noted Diem had stated need 20,000 more in 1957. Both Ty
                            and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> expressed grave concern

                                needed two or three months training. Diem raised the question of

                                in Hanoi on 13 May 1959, the Central Committee of the North
                                VietNamese Communist Party publicly announced its intent “smash” the
                                government of President Diem. Following this decision, the Viet Cong
                                have significantly increased their program of infiltration,
                                subversion, sabotage and assassination designed to achieve this
                                end.</p>
                            <p>At the North Vietnamese Communist Party Congress in September, 1960,
                                the earlier declaration of underground war by the Party’s Control
                                Committee was re-affirmed. This action by the Party Congress took
                                place only a month after Kong Le’s coup in Laos. Scarcely two months
                                later there was a military uprising in Saigon. The turmoil created
                                throughout the area by this rapid succession of events provides an
                                ideal environment for the Communist “master plan” to take over all
                                of Southeast Asia.</p>
                            <p>Since that time, as can be seen from the attached map,<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5">Not found.</note> the internal security
                                situation in South VietNam has become critical. What amounts to a
                                state of active guerilla warfare now exists throughout the country.
                                    <hi rend="underline">Despite greatly stepped up efforts by South
                                    VietNamese forces</hi>, the number of Viet Cong hard-core

                                12,000 today. The number of violent incidents per month now averages

                            <p>The Viet Cong over the past two years have succeeded in stepping up
                                the pace and intensity of their attacks to the point where South
                                VietNam is nearing the decisive phase in its battle for survival. If
                                the situation continues to deteriorate, the Communists will be able
                                to press on to their strategic goal of establishing a rival
                                “National Liberation Front” government in one of <hi rend="underline">its</hi> (these) “secure areas,” thereby
                                plunging the nation into open civil war. They have publicly
                                announced that they will “take over the country before the end of
                                1961.”</p>
                            <p>If agreement is reached on a cease fire in Laos, political

                                statement on Laos by the Peiping government<note n="6" xml:id="d42fn6">For text of this statement, see <hi rend="italic">Survey of China Mainland Press</hi>, No. 2487,
                                    May 2, 1961, pp. 31-32.</note> indicates that the Communist
                                members of that conference intend to expand the negotiations to
                                include other areas of Southeast Asia. As a result, it can be
                                expected that the Fourteen Power meeting will be prolonged, covering
                                several months or more.</p>
                            <p>The effect of these negotiations on the situation in VietNam will be
                                threefold: <list>
                                    <item>First, the very fact that the Fourteen Powers are meeting
                                        under essentially the same ground rules as the 1954 Geneva
                                        Accords, including the concept of an <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> mechanism in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia,
                                        could have a politically inhibiting effect on any
                                        significant measures which the U.S. might undertake to
                                        prevent a Communist take-over in South VietNam.</item>
                                    <item>Second, as has been their practice in the past, the
                                        Communists can be expected to use the cover of an
                                        international negotiation to expand their subversive
                                        activities. In this case, close coordination of their
                                        efforts in Southern Laos, Cambodia and VietNam can be
                                        expected. The 250 mile border between South VietNam and
                                        Laos, while never effectively sealed in the past, will now
                                        be deprived of even the semblance of protection which the
                                        friendly, pro-western Laos offers.</item>
                                    <item>Third, the three principal passes through the Annamite
                                        Mountains—the Nape Pass, Mugia Gap, and the pass that
                                        controls the road from Quang Tri to Savannakhet—lie in
                                        Southern Laos. These passes control three key military
                                        avenues of advance from North VietNam through Laos into the
                                        open Mekong valley leading to Thailand and South VietNam. A
                                        Lao political settlement that would afford the Communists an
                                        opportunity to maintain any sort of control, covertly or
                                        otherwise, of these mountain passes would make them gate
                                        keepers to the primary inland invasion route leading to <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0117"/>Saigon and flanking
                                        the most important defensive terrain in the northern area of
                                        South VietNam.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>Thus the situation is critical, but not hopeless. The South
                                VietNamese Government, with American aid, is increasing its
                                capabilities to fight its attackers. It provides a strong
                                anti-Communist government and generally pro-American population as a
                                base upon which the necessary additional effort can be founded to
                                defeat the Communist attack. Should the Communist effort increase,
                                either directly or as a result of a collapse of Laos, additional
                                measures beyond those proposed herein may be necessary.</p>

                                Rather the need is to focus the U.S. effort in South VietNam on the

                                where, at least for the time being, primary emphasis must be placed
                                on providing a solution to the internal security program. A

                                counter Communist subversion in South VietNam has been the
                                development of the Counter-Insurgency Plan. This Plan—a summary <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0118"/>of which is attached as Annex

                                    confidence in him as a man of great stature and as one of the
                                    strong figures in Southeast Asia on whom we are placing our

                                    political and economic reforms in Vietnam which are an essential
                                    element in frustrating Communist encroachments. Recognizing the

                                    insurgency and the government’s inability to protect its own
                                    people. Thus military measures must have the highest priority.
                                    There is, nevertheless, strong discontent with the government
                                    among not only the elite but among peasants, labor and business.
                                    Criticism focuses on the dynastic aspects of the Diem rule. on
                                    its clandestine political apparatus and on the methods through
                                    which the President exercises his leadership. This is aggravated
                                    by Communists’ subversive attempts to discredit the President
                                    and weaken his government’s authority. All this is made the
                                    easier because of a communication void existing between the
                                    government and the people. For many months United States efforts
                                    have been directed toward persuading Diem to adopt political,
                                    social, and economic changes designed to correct this serious
                                    defect. Many of these changes are included in the
                                    Counter-Insurgency Plan. Our success has only been partial.
                                    There are those who consider that Diem will not succeed in the

                                    If his efforts are inadequate in this field, our overall

                                    politically-charged problem like border-control. In 1960
                                    Cambodia made a major request for military assistance to which
                                    we made only a token response. We should endeavor to obtain

                                steps to be taken, leaving the explanatory background and discussion
                                to a separate annex. He further suggested that this annex also
                                embody the funding discussion in the paper. He proposed that two

                            <item>In turning to the revised Task Force draft, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> stated that while he
                                hoped it would be possible to work out a maximum area of agreement
                                we need not be inhibited from showing a split position on major
                                points of difference if such points emerged. In this connection,
                                however, he stated that he personally accepted without question the
                                interrelated nature of the military and nonmilitary actions which
                                were required if the problem represented by Viet-Nam was to be
                                successfully addressed. The need was not to establish an absolute
                                priority of one above the other. We need both working toward the
                                same objective.</item>

                            <item>On the organizational problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> indicated that agreement had been reached
                                to accept the State proposal as contained in the Task Force draft,
                                as revised by the Dept. of State, which vests the continuing
                                responsibility for the inter-departmental Task Force in the
                                Department of State. He suggested, however, that Defense preferred
                                to have General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName>
                                act as its representative rather than as deputy director of the Task

                                    his memo as follows: “The U.S. past performance and theory of
                                    action, which State apparently desires to continue, simply

                            <item>In turning to the specifics of the revised Task Force paper, Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> suggested that
                                the necessary position papers and related backstopping for the Vice
                                President’s trip should be handled by the State Department and not,
                                at least in any detail, be embodied within the Task Force paper.
                                However, to obtain a comprehensive picture of the Viet-Nam
                                undertaking, the Vice Presidential trip could continue to be
                                reflected in general in the Task Force paper.</item>

                            <item>As a second point of immediate interest, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> stated that the Defense
                                Dept. was concerned over the relationship between <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0139"/>the proposed 14-nation conference
                                on Laos<note n="6" xml:id="d43fn6">Reference is to the 14-nation
                                    conference on Laos that opened May 15 at Geneva.</note> and the
                                suggestions which had been advanced for the deployment of additional
                                U.S. forces to VietNam. He expressed the fear that once the
                                conference is initiated the effort will be made by the Communists to
                                tie the negotiations to a general discussion of Southeast Asia which
                                could result in a freeze of forces into and out of the area. He
                                pointed out that a marine brigade could be in Viet-Nam in 12 hours
                                and that this could be further reinforced by army forces in Hawaii
                                over a somewhat longer period of time as requirements demanded.
                                Particularly in light of the projected May 12 starting date for the
                                conference Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> felt
                                that this point would have to be placed before the President which
                                the Dept. of Defense proposed to do independently of the Task Force
                                paper, although he indicated his feeling that the matter should be
                                referred to by the Task Force as well.</item>

                                was being given to the possibility of a postponement of the opening
                                date of the conference, a position apparently independently arrived
                                at by the French government. In the event of a postponement of the
                                opening date, the urgency of reaching a decision on U.S. troop
                                deployment would be somewhat alleviated though the basic problem
                                remained for resolution.</item>

                            <item>In turning to the question of the formal disavowal of the Geneva
                                Accords, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to
                                a memorandum prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CAJ1">Chayes</persName>, the Department of State legal advisor,<note n="8" xml:id="d43fn8">Not found.</note> pointing out that the
                                whole structure of the Indochina partition rested on the Accords. As
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained it, the
                                issue was not whether we removed the inhibitions which the Accords
                                have heretofore placed upon our actions but rather the manner and
                                the degree to which we took such action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that he was fully in
                                accord with the need to move fast on developing a definitive
                                position on this point which he undertook to do.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated that he
                                felt that it was necessary to carefully consider our basic strategy,
                                particularly in connection with the pending conference and in
                                connection with the proposal for troop deployment. On the first
                                point he felt that we might consider a focus of attention on the
                                inability of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to protect
                                frontiers developing a highly aggressive offensive to be used in the
                                conference. <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0140"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRG1">Cleveland</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> pointed out that precisely
                                such a position was in process of development with extensive
                                materials being gathered to bolster the effort. On the second point,
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated that it was
                                essential that we have a maximum degree of clarity both as to the
                                types of U.S. troops which were required in Viet-Nam and as to the
                                precise missions which they would be expected to fulfill. He pointed
                                out that this might be a “plate glass window” or “trip wire”
                                function but that in this event we would want to be sure that our
                                forces had a clear function and relationship to the
                                counter-insurgency effort.</item>

                                pointing out that the availability of U.S. combat troops in Viet-Nam
                                could result in the release of indigenous forces pursuing the
                                counter-insurgency effort.</item>

                                he felt that there were largely three alternative rationales for the
                                supply of U.S. forces: (1) a step-up in our previous activities
                                directed against the insurgency movement by involving additional
                                training forces, etc., (2) provision of sufficient force to act as a
                                trip wire and (3) sufficient forces to meet an anticipated major
                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> invasion.</item>

                            <item>General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> injected
                                to ask how many individuals Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> was thinking of in terms of increasing the
                                force capability to meet the first objective, i.e., the
                                counter-insurgency problem, for example, hundreds? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> indicated that hundreds
                                might be appropriate but to be applied gradually as they could be
                                effectively absorbed. He pointed out that he felt that such an
                                acceleration in our current efforts was quite a different matter
                                from putting in U.S. combat units. He stated that this latter action
                                particularly required clarification in connection with Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>’s 14-nation

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked if the
                                Chiefs had addressed the question of U.S. combat troop deployment to
                                VietNam. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName>
                                said the Chiefs had made an assessment in terms of the Lao situation
                                but not specifically in terms of the proposal for deployment in
                                VietNam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> stated
                                he would like to have the Chiefs’ assessment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> stated that it would also be
                                useful to get a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> judgment on the
                                ability of choking off the VietCong from infiltrating into South
                                VietNam. Both General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> stated their doubts as to the ability to
                                effectively shut off the 1500 mile border. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> said that this then raised a
                                question as to why we should pour hundreds of millions into Viet-Nam
                                if we can’t choke off the problem. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> stated that he believed
                                this brought the discussion to the central point which is, how
                                seriously are we to take the objective which represents the Task
                                Force’s basic term of reference, viz. preventing Communist
                                domination of VietNam. He stated that if we are to <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0141"/>take this seriously, we should
                                recognize that it posed a major requirement for very sizeable force
                                commitments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                                asked what was behind Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName>’s view that a marine brigade would be very
                                useful. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName>
                                said he could not speak for Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Burke</persName> but believed that he meant that it would carry
                                important symbolic value as an indication of U.S. willingness to
                                fight. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated that
                                it was important that the kinds of commitments and U.S. aid which we
                                provide be clearly directed toward whatever we consider our basic
                                objectives to be. For example, if the threat is from overt
                                aggression from North Viet-Nam we need one sort of a plan. If it is
                                to meet the insurrection we need another plan. Or if it is to choke
                                off infiltration at the border we need still another plan. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> referred to the
                                important positive psychological advantages which the introduction
                                of troops into the area would have. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> stated that the Chiefs
                                would need as clear a statement of the real national intent as
                                possible in order to give clear policy guidance concerning the
                                commitment of forces. For example, even the commitment of one marine
                                brigade tied down a significant amount of U.S. land combat power and
                                it was therefore necessary to know whether this should be considered
                                a permanent commitment. Alternatively, if we envisage the
                                possibility of “pulling them out” with a clear knowledge and
                                evaluation of the impact thereof, this would be important to know.
                                He stated that he felt that if our interest as a nation is to resist
                                a further Communist encroachment beyond the line drawn in Laos and
                                if we are willing to fight for this objective then the commitment of
                                U.S. combat forces would be worthwhile though a major
                                undertaking.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> expressed the
                                view that the Task Force papers should address themselves to these
                                broad implications and various alternatives to troop deployment
                                suggesting that they be thoroughly explored but that the body of the
                                recommendations in the paper be primarily limited to whatever was
                                necessary to meet the insurgency problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that we must be honest
                                in assessing the ability of U.S. military power to be effectively
                                employed against the Viet-Cong guerrilla effort. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> pointed out that it was
                                by no means solely a military effort to handle the insurgency
                                problem and, moreover, that much depended on the nature of the
                                Laotian settlement. He expressed the view that if we wanted to put
                                down the insurgency effort in VietNam, if we had a reasonably
                                workable settlement in Laos, bolstered by the barrier between Laos
                                and Viet-Nam and along the 17th parallel, we could probably succeed.
                                He cited our experiences with the Greek civil war pointing out that
                                such an effort cannot succeed by partial steps. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> commented that in the Greek
                                situation we were dealing with a unified public and eventually with
                                a disaffection of Tito (which <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0142"/>closed off assistance to the guerrillas). Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that we
                                not lose sight of the French experience in fighting guerrillas in
                                Indochina. He also stated that the difference between the insertion
                                of U.S. combat forces as such, as distinct from U.S. forces training
                                the VietNamese, posed the implication of the U.S. vs. Communists as
                                the principal protagonists as against the VietNamese fighting an
                                internal effort supported by the Communists. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> in commenting on the
                                French experience, said that the French lost the Indochina effort
                                because of an unwillingness to train indigenous forces above the
                                grade of corporal because of a fear that the forces once trained
                                would eventually throw them out. Obviously the indigenous forces
                                under foreign leadership had no incentive to fight.</item>

                                would take if we decided to hold firm and fight in VietNam. He
                                indicated that he felt the area needed to be looked at as a whole
                                though he acknowledged General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s point that there were differences as
                                between the neighboring countries, in the people, in their language,
                                etc. He still felt that the area was linked together.</item>

                                that if our policies resulted in the loss of Southeast Asia this
                                would have an impact on all other areas of the world where the
                                credibility of our guarantees to protect nations would be open to
                                serious doubt. He specifically mentioned Latin America and the Near
                                East. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> reiterated
                                his view as to the need to focus on the three most logical
                                alternative objectives for the application of military force (i.e.
                                to fight the insurrectionist movement, as a trip wire and to resist
                                massive invasion). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> reiterated that this problem should be
                                recognized in the Task Force paper although its major focus should
                                be on the insurgency problem.</item>

                            <item>General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> raised
                                a question concerning the statement of our objectives particularly
                                as regards the emphasis which should be placed upon political action
                                in relation to military actions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> stated that he recognized that the two
                                objectives existed side by side with “no clear bright line between
                                them.” He stated that the exact blending of the two actions would
                                have to be worked out. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> questioned whether the two points of view
                                were in basic opposition and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> agreed with the implication of the remark,
                                that certainly this was not true at all or even at a majority of
                                points. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">Fitzgerald</persName>
                                believed that there still was an unresolved conflict, citing that
                                the 20,000 troop increase had heretofore been held out as a carrot
                                for VietNamese concessions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> both stated that this matter was settled, that
                                the troop increase was approved and that its exact manner of
                                communication to the VietNamese would be worked out in the <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0143"/>negotiation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FGD1">Fitzgerald</persName> asked how long the
                                negotiation was to go on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said that would be handled by the people

                                questions concerning the communication to President Diem. It was
                                agreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>
                                would identify the key elements in the Task Force proposal which
                                would be communicated to President Diem in a letter from President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> which would be
                                delivered by Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that Defense should focus on this
                                letter with State, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> asked General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> to do so for Defense.
                                General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName> stated
                                that if it was implied that the letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to Diem should contain an
                                insistence on Diem’s “being a good boy” and otherwise insisting on
                                various conditions this would be exactly contrary to Asian
                                psychology and would place Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> in “the same trap as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> found himself in.” Both
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName> and Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CRG1">Cleveland</persName> indicated that
                                this was not to be the tone or nature of the letter and Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> stated that
                                it was intended to make the letter essentially non-controversial and
                                that Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                                did not want to get into a detailed debate with Diem. General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> asked if the
                                letter would have specific reference to the U.S. force contribution
                                which seemed to be implied in the State redraft. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weiss</persName> indicated that it was not
                                intended that this be contained in the letter since the timing would
                                preclude the careful consideration of the serious issues raised by
                                the troop deployment proposal, as indicated by the discussion at

                                said that it would be best to permit State to come up with a draft
                                which Defense could then react to. He indicated in response to an
                                inquiry that the proposed letter would not require NSC
                                consideration.</item>

                                deployment of U.S. forces as this affected our position in the
                                14-nation conference, to take action in opposition to the Accords
                                would inhibit our position in the Conference where we might be
                                trying to benefit from the terms of the Accords. The point being
                                that we would have to decide the relative political and military

                                was of dubious practical value. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CRG1">Cleveland</persName> agreed but felt that it was useful to

                                pointed out that it helped to make the record clear. The question
                                was raised as to whether the observers would be in both North and
                                South Viet-Nam with the indication being that State had been
                                thinking solely of South Viet-Nam on the grounds that this is
                                presumably where the insurgent action was observable. The general
                                consensus was, however, that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                observers should be requested for both North and South

                                assist even if in a small way, that they had a special capability
                                for doing so stemming from their Malayan experiences and that it was
                                to our advantage to share the responsibility with our allies.

                                that his concern was that the British would use this as a means for
                                exercising control over our freedom of action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weiss</persName> indicated that the British
                                contribution would be quite limited in numbers and size, thereby
                                hardly warranting a major voice in policy formulation. He asked
                                General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> whether
                                there would be any objection if the British were prepared to provide
                                their technical aid under direct U.S. control. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> said he did not see why
                                we should keep the British out and in fact saw advantage to bringing
                                them in. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated
                                that in the last analysis he thought that we had our allies “over
                                our shoulder” when it came to facing up to the need to fight. The
                                problem was not in keeping the British out but rather in getting
                                them in and sharing the problem with us. General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> stated that he did not
                                want to be misrepresented. The U.S. military do not want to fight a
                                war but believe the best way to avoid such a contingency is to show
                                strength early and did not want the British or others to dilute our
                                position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                                agreed, but felt that we should see if we can’t bring the British in
                                more closely and get their contribution. Mr.
                                    <persName>Hansen</persName> raised the question concerning
                                adequacy of staff available to the Ambassador to carry out increased
                                actions proposed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WS1">Weiss</persName>
                                stated it was intended that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> include an assessment of staff requirements
                                in his initial review of the situation. It was agreed that this
                                matter would be mentioned in the Task Force report. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> stated that he felt a review
                                of current <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> field activities was
                                also needed to see if lesser <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0145"/>priority items could not be deferred to make people available for

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> supported the
                                position taken in the State draft, particularly that of tying
                                together the total economic and social problem for overall review.
                                He indicated that he also believed we would need a sizeable package
                                to negotiate with the VietNamese and suspected that the $50 million
                                development fund was probably understated. He suggested that our
                                position on this be kept flexible. Mr. <persName>Fine</persName>
                                agreed that the figure was arbitrary and could be considerably
                                larger. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LJM1">Leddy</persName> suggested
                                that the paper might reflect recognition that depending on outcome
                                of monetary reforms “substantial funds may have to be committed over
                                period of years.” General <persName corresp="#p_BMGCH1">Bonesteel</persName> stated that as a serious student of this
                                sort of situation, the question was raised in his mind as to whether
                                emphasis on various economic programs might not “be doing too much
                                too fast,” thereby distracting attention from fighting. He alluded
                                to our experience in this connection in the early part of the Greek
                                program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> and
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that the
                                economic efforts should be pursued as set forth in the State draft
                                but that the long-range development program and stabilization
                                program should be reversed in order of treatment in the
                                paper.</item>

                            Vietnam</hi></p>
                        <p>We must seriously consider precautionary measures to “seal off” South
                            Viet-Nam in such a way as to deter another Laos.</p>
                        <p>It seems almost certain that the other side will raise Viet-Nam issues
                            (perhaps reunification) in 14-nation conference. Moreover, Viet-Nam
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> is still in existence although
                            hardly functioning. Our sending any troops to Viet-Nam now or later
                            would be violation of Geneva Accords, to which Saigon is party. But we
                            will be violating <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0146"/>this in any
                            case if we increase <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> strength, and
                            other side will surely raise hell at the conference.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as a “half-way house,” why not urge Diem to abrogate Geneva
                            Accords before the conference begins. After it starts, he will get an
                            even bigger black eye if he does. He could simultaneously apply for
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> membership, and perhaps ask
                            for <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> troops. This would establish
                            legal basis for our subsequent entry even if we decided not to do so
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p>Is Pentagon contingency planning for troops to Viet-Nam geared too much
                            to sensible military objectives, thus involving forces too large and
                            unwieldy for early action? The purpose of sending forces is not to fight
                            guerrillas. It would be to establish a US “presence”; this could be
                            accomplished by no more than a battalion supported by naval power.</p>
                        <p>Why not invite Asian <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> states
                            simultaneously to send token contingents? They need not actually send
                            them on such short notice, but we could announce when we went in that
                            they had agreed in principle to do so.</p>
                        <p>I am not convinced that we should send troops to Vietnam. But I am
                            convinced we should carefully weigh the cost to us of waiting until
                            conference is underway and Vietnamese situation has perhaps seriously
                            deteriorated. Also Diem (as well as Sarit) urgently needs some
                            reassurance in aftermath of Laos; I doubt that VP’s visit or <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> alone would suffice.</p>

                                    <item>One of the many urgent actions required to save Viet-Nam
                                        is the 20,000 increase in Vietnam’s military strength which
                                        U.S. has generally approved. This additional strength is to
                                        be used to defeat the Viet Cong in Vietnam.</item>

                                    <item>There are differing views within the Embassy as well as
                                        the U.S. Govt at the Washington level as to whether the U.S.
                                        or Viet-Nam will pay for this added authorized strength. The
                                        arguments as I understand them, are that one segment of the
                                        U.S. Govt (and Embassy staff) considers that Viet-Nam has
                                        the necessary means to finance this additional effort and
                                        should do so. The Vietnamese Govt, on the other hand,
                                        considers that for a variety of reasons they are unable to
                                        do so.</item>

                                        little or no real action taken to implement the increase in
                                        authorized strength. When I was in Saigon, only 4 to 6,000
                                        of the increase had been raised and the entire effort was
                                        grinding to a dead halt with critical loss of time in
                                        initiating the long training period required.</item>

                            <item>The problem of Vietnam, from the U.S. point of view, is very
                                simple and very clear. I believe it can be stated in these words:
                                Does the U.S. want Viet-Nam to follow the path of Laos (with all the
                                effect that would have on the rest of SE Asia) or does the U.S.
                                really want to maintain Viet-Nam as an independent non-Communist
                                state closely <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0149"/>aligned with
                                the West? Stated another way, does the U.S. intend to take the
                                necessary military action now to defeat the Viet Cong threat or do
                                we intend to quibble for weeks and months over details of general
                                policy, finances, Vietnamese Govt organization, etc., while Viet-Nam
                                slowly but surely goes down the drain of Communism as North Viet-Nam
                                and a large portion of Laos have gone to date?</item>

                                recommendations to President Diem in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s presence, the President
                                has now issued edicts designating a field command as the directional

                                establishing a central intelligence agency. Both actions were felt

                                key actions in the counterinsurgency plan and indicates that

                                to meet the threat and has taken actions that were not easy for him

                            propaganda campaign on Viet Cong insurgency in VietNam. Our instructions
                            are to start this immediately and continue it at the highest possible
                            level until further notice.</p>
                        <p>One of our big problems is scarcity of unclassified material upon which
                            to draw for specifics of Viet Cong insurgency and terrorism. All steps
                            are being taken here to get as much past material declassified as
                            possible. But the real crux of the problem lies in Saigon, i.e.,
                            classification at the source. The <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>

                            so as much material as possible can be put into public channels world

                        <p>I wish you would make it a point to see Colby as soon after his arrival
                            as possible, discuss this whole problem with him and work closely with
                            him on developing a flow of material. It can move in any form that seems
                            advisable, despatch, telegram, or signals; but it should move through
                            our channels to give our media operators ready access to it at this
                            end.</p>

                                this from happening. They both state this is primarily military
                                problem and in seeking a solution we must <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0152"/>not be overly restricted by such

                            began on the schedule for Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s trip to Asia. Initially, the Embassy in Saigon
                            wanted him to arrive in Viet-Nam in time for Diem’s inauguration on
                            April 29, but this was not feasible. By early May, plans for the trip

                            Thailand, India, and Pakistan, beginning May 9 and ending May 24. On May
                            5, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> announced at
                            his press conference that he had asked the Vice President to undertake a

                            on May 11 and proceeded directly to the Gia Long Palace, the official
                            government guest house. That evening the Vice President attended a

                            day. On May 12, he held extensive conversations with President Diem
                            starting at 8 a.m. followed by a day of ceremonial visits which ended
                            with a dinner in his honor hosted by Diem. On May 13, the Vice President
                            paid a brief farewell call on Diem at 8 a.m. before departing for Manila

                            role might be in cooperation with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            Vice President stressed that we could learn much from Diem’s experience
                            and he had come to listen to his views as well as present President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s.</p>
                        <p>Diem read letter and then proceeded outline situation in Viet-Nam both
                            historic and present. He brought in particularly aspects of situation
                            suggested by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s
                            letter and noted that he had proposed 20,000 force increase and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for full Civil Guard several
                            years ago.</p>

                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s letter and
                            asked Diem specifically whether he agreed to various proposals in

                            discussion established that personal bond between men of power and
                            authority so essential for effective dealing with Asian leaders. As
                            earnest of cooperation Sarit has agreed to increase Thai Defense budget
                            by ten percent of our contribution, which Embassy considers symbolically
                                <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0166"/>significant. Meanwhile Diem
                            issued his own communiqué and directed quick preparation of positive
                            reply to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s
                                letter,<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">See <ref target="#d55fn4">footnote 4, Document 55</ref>.</note> which is promising. I
                            feel greatly heartened that we have at last opened a two-way channel of
                            confidence at the highest level with these three men. Later might have
                            been too late.</p>
                        <p>The “veep to the people program” also went over, notwithstanding the
                            reserve and scepticism of the orthodox and the old timers Asians and
                            Americans. What impressed me in all four capitals was the eagerness of
                            the younger generation, particularly the school children to reach him.
                            This was especially significant in Bangkok. Young people gathered
                            everywhere to greet an American leader and spokesman for the President
                            whose name was often sounded by voices among the crowds. The leaders of
                            tomorrow and the people of the future were with the Vice President. He
                            reached them in a new kind of dialogue despite the reserve of the
                            receding generation. The Vice President dramatically carried the
                            pedestal of power to the open places of the people far better than could
                            long lectures or diplomatic notes. Witnessing an American Vice President
                            mixing with the crowds and talking with them may serve to humanize
                            political communications in Asia. It may jostle political leaders and
                            their administrators out of their office sanctuaries, even if they are
                            nettled by this typically American approach. Some officials felt
                            challenged to go and do likewise; others betrayed their uneasiness over
                            this intrusion into their supposedly well ordered and old-fashioned
                            system of aristocratic aloofness.</p>
                        <p>This enterprise also succeeded psychologically. It boosted the
                            badly-sagging morale of Asians and Americans out here. He pictured the
                            new administration for Southeast Asians. It filled the newspapers and TV
                            of America with Southeast Asia. Where our image has been blurred, the
                            mission sharpened the focus. Where our dialogue had been garbled, the
                            mission has corrected the pitch and spoken clearly as well as
                            eloquently. However, we must not now just bask in the afterglow. The
                            words of assurance must be followed by acts of support. Shrewd, tough
                            leaders like Diem, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName>, and
                            particularly <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName>, are waiting to
                            see if the US follows through quickly and vigorously with concrete
                            actions. Owing to his deep concern over Laos and the vulnerability of
                            his long frontier, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName> is waiting to see what material steps we now take
                            in Southeast Asia. Neither he nor Thai public opinion were pleased that
                            the US could give no specific assurances on Laos. The visit exposed but
                            could not fill our gaping silence on Laos for understandable reasons. If
                            the visits to Bangkok and Saigon do not result in more real support, we
                            will look terrible in Southeast Asia. Neutralism will spread; Geneva <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0167"/>might then turn into a
                            communist victory celebration. The follow-up of this visit is the heart
                            of the matter now. <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName>, for
                            example, wants some material benefit from the United States alliance to
                            show his officers and people. In Viet-Nam will the government with our
                            massive support take steps to ensure a political acceptability? In
                            Thailand can we stimulate a political motivation among the armed forces
                            and rural people to support a defense plan to secure the Mekong
                            Valley?</p>
                        <p>A significant outcome of this enterprise was the parallelism of views
                            expressed by the four leaders we met, particularly Diem, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName>.</p>

                                difficulties in dealing there. Diem, <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName> stressed the urgency of maximum training for

                            <item>For the time being these three leaders are allergic to putting US
                                soldiers into the area. Diem showed no appetite for American combat
                                troops mixing among the Vietnamese people. He told me privately that
                                we should be extremely careful about such a proposal, and pleaded
                                with me that American military personnel-and all Americans-exercise
                                tact and restraint in Viet-Nam in this critical and delicate period.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName> also quickly backed
                                away from taking up any suggestion of putting US troops in Thailand
                                either under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> or otherwise.
                                He was not so reluctant over Laos where, if hostilities are resumed,
                                he will wish to lend military support to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> but only in company with US. I think we must be

                                there is no major provocation such as the outbreak of large scale
                                hostilities or infiltration. What they want is adequate equipment
                                and training rapidly and efficiently provided to assure them success

                                    from Washington. The leaders and the people will now expect us

                        <p>In conclusion, the next step is to capitalize the assets of this visit
                            and disregard some of the minor liabilities or irritants that inevitably
                            follow in the wake of such an ambitious enterprise: 1) First we must go
                            all out to stamp out the Viet Cong in the Delta area of Vietnam. To
                            implement a comprehensive politico-military program the President and
                            his brother promised me that they would reply positively and in detail
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s letter as
                            the Vice President suggested. I urged Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> carry the letter to Washington,
                            but I would not be surprised if he were kept in Saigon where he is so
                            needed. 2) We must draft a supplemental military program for Thailand
                            and reverse the cutback for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> program which seems to
                            contradict reality out here (a really good team of experts should be
                            sent to help on fiscal planning and economic development). 3) We need to
                            clarify our contingency thinking on Laos for the benefit of Diem and
                                <persName corresp="#p_ST1">Sarit</persName>. 4) We must use the
                            opportunities the visit gave us to mount military, economic, social, and
                            psychological reinforcement of Thailand, Viet-Nam and as much of Laos as
                            possible to strengthen our hand at Geneva. 5) In order to retain the
                            value of this trip I would urge <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> to
                            compile a booklet of the speeches, communiqués, pictures and schedules
                            of this visit for circulation in this area to play up its progressive
                            gains.</p>
                        <p>This enterprising visit did not help our adversaries. It will hurt them
                            in this area if we follow through quickly. We should be ready for their
                            counter actions at least in propaganda and political action
                            somewhere.</p>

                            Reps and Sec-Gen. Pakistan Rep then suggested that since Vice Pres

                            that Vice Pres had consulted with Diem on two major problems: (1)
                            military pacification and (2) social-economic development. US position
                            is insurgency must be eliminated. Pres <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> suggested following as principal means
                            accomplishing this: (1) Immediate increase <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> armed forces by 20,000, with US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to keep under review possible further
                            expansion. Increase to consist mainly ground forces supplied by US. (2)
                            Development new style civil guard stationed in and around villages to
                            replace old civil guard who not properly trained, armed or organized.
                            Estimated figure in neighborhood fifty to sixty thousand. (3) Assistance

                            of frontiers. I stressed point that old methods of defense by no means
                            being abandoned but that we mean to supplement them with new
                            developments particularly suitable to situation this part of world. If
                            worthwhile developments result from R &amp; D efforts Vietnam, they
                            might well be applied to other countries of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. US is convinced prevention infiltration a most
                            difficult task but is determined do everything possible to limit
                            infiltration. Idea is to be sure we are trying every means to play game
                            better than Communists. I reported that Pres Diem most receptive to U.S.
                            proposals and arrangements now under way for early implementation.</p>
                        <p>I said Vice Pres and Diem also considered need for technical assistance,
                            not only by US but by other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members
                            and interested countries. Particularly assistance in rehabilitation of
                            villages subject <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0170"/>to attack or
                            duress from Viet Cong. I emphasized that this would be a major
                            undertaking and that Viet-Nam would need extensive help from outside. I
                            urged other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> govts, particularly
                            those with experience in this or related fields, to lend assistance. I
                            noted that general discussion also held on long-term economic and social
                            assistance and that plans under way for establishing joint cost-sharing
                            arrangement. I noted that long-term development concept consistent with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> administration
                            emphasis on long-range rather than “crash” projects. I informed
                            colleagues we had appointed a task force to work with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>; that in US view welfare of Vietnamese
                            populace and their attitude toward <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            is key factor. We recognize this is matter of extreme delicacy and this
                            was one reason Vice Pres <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            personally given responsibility for approaching Diem.</p>
                        <p>I then emphasized that US horizons by no means limited to Viet-Nam and
                            that Pres has placed very high priority on all <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. He wishes be sure our commitments to Asian friends
                            well understood not only by Asian govts and peoples but also by other
                            side. Our present goal is stabilization of Laos and, in addition,
                            prevention festering sore of communism spreading into neighboring
                            countries. We have no illusions task will be easy but job is under way
                            and we intend see it through. In answer Philippine question on morale
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces compared with <gloss target="#t_FAL1">FAL</gloss>, I noted morale high and they willing
                            to fight despite weariness of long campaign against Viet Cong. I cited
                            new ranger units as particularly effective, not only as fighters and
                            village watchdogs but because of their humane treatment of villagers
                            which earning them real popularity and bringing people closer to Govt.
                            French and Australian Reps commented that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troops have no misgivings about nature and intention
                            Viet Cong, having confessed atrocities perpetuated such as wholesale
                            assassinations, burning of schools and terrorizing children and
                            teachers.</p>
                        <p>Turning momentarily to North Vietnam, French Rep said French official
                            from Hanoi now visiting Bangkok reports severe famine in North Vietnam.
                                <persName corresp="#p_REE1">Rice</persName> ration totals 9 kilos
                            per month and only 500 grams meat when available. New ration cards
                            required every fortnight, people fainting on streets, and police control
                            tightening. In this official’s view, famine is one major motivating
                            factor behind Viet Cong guerrilla activities in South Vietnam. French
                            Rep will have further consultations and expects receive extensive report
                            which he hopes make available other council Reps next mtg.</p>
                        <p>All council Reps expressed deep interest in US plans for South Viet-Nam
                            as I had outlined. Australian Rep particularly interested in new
                            developmental plans but said he also pleased US not neglecting older
                            method which possibly not fully exploited in past. Stopping terrorism
                            and reinforcing rural populace is at heart of Viet-Nam problem he felt
                            sure Australia would wish join US in program for <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0171"/>South VietNam and believes Australian
                            experiences New Guinea and Malaya might be helpful. Philippine Rep
                            believes his govt could provide expert advice and assistance in view its
                            experience with Huk problem. He also suggested operation brotherhood
                            medical activities might be extended to Vietnam. New Zealand Rep
                            similarly expressed interest and felt his govt might take part.</p>

                        <p>Among the countries which I visited, the threat to peace and progress is
                            most direct and immediate in Viet Nam. That country has come a long way
                            since the days when the Indo-China war was brought to a halt by the
                            first Geneva Conference of 1954. Relative initial peace and a major land
                            reform and other programs of self help have restored agricultural
                            production and lifted it to new highs. Internal communications as well
                            as the transportation system have been expanded. Industrial development
                            has begun in earnest. Responsible political institutions have begun to
                            function, as attested to by the recent election. Social progress in
                            education and health and other fields has been significant.</p>
                        <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0172"/>
                        <p>This great constructive work was made possible by the personal dedication
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, the
                            efforts of the Vietnamese people themselves and by the infusion of large
                            amounts of United States aid. While this aid has gone largely for the
                            support of a large military establishment, it has enabled the Vietnamese
                            to join their own resources with our economic aid for many constructive
                            undertakings.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the continuance of this constructive work is now
                            threatened by a resurgence of Viet Minh terrorism in South Viet Nam. The
                            number of these trained and organized disrupters has risen in recent
                            months from three thousand to an estimated twelve thousand. Though
                            relatively few in number, their capacity for disruption is very great.
                            This is the nature of this type of activity as indicated by experience
                            in Malaya, Burma and elsewhere. It may be that those with experience
                            elsewhere with this problem could be most helpful in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>The basic problem in Viet Nam is not very different than it is for all of
                            the nations of the region. The ordinary people need decent houses. They
                            need schools. They need better conditions of health. They need the
                            productive industries, the thriving agriculture and the safe and
                            adequate transportation and communications which will make all of these
                            things possible. They need an understanding government which is close to
                            them and in which they feel a stake.</p>
                        <p>The will to achieve these improvements is present in Viet Nam. The
                            determination and the energy to obtain them is present. Yet, the effort
                            to achieve them is frustrated and disrupted by the agents of terrorism
                            as well as by the ever-present shadow of the massive communist armed
                            forces in North Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>In short, that degree of material security which acts to release the full
                            and constructive energies of peoples is not present in Viet Nam. Unless
                            it is forthcoming in the near future, the great efforts and sacrifices,
                            the vast amounts of aid which have poured into this country in the
                            interests of peace and security may go down the drain.</p>
                        <p>I am assured by responsible officials-military and civilian-of this
                            government and the government of Viet Nam, that Viet Nam can be made
                            secure against the depredations of the organized terrorists who roam the
                            countryside. I am assured, further, by these officials that the country
                            can be made reasonably secure against invasion by the Viet Minh from the
                            north.</p>
                        <p>An increase in military aid will be necessary for this purpose. New
                            methods and new tactics for dealing with the problem of terrorism will
                            be required. This will not be a short-term proposition. It will not be
                            cheap. Yet, if this effort will in fact produce the security necessary
                            for progress in freedom in Viet Nam, as those <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0173"/>who are expert in these matters say
                            that it will, then it is in our interests as well as the interests of
                            the Vietnamese people and all free nations that the effort be made. The
                            price of the failure to make the sacrifices now in Viet Nam will be paid
                            for later in the increased jeopardy to the United States and other free
                            nations. The failure to act vigorously to stop the killing now in Viet
                            Nam may well be paid for later with the lives of Americans all over
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Let me stress, however, that a mere increase in the level of military aid
                            on our part to Viet Nam will not necessarily solve the difficulty. There
                            must be new methods for the use of all such aid. It must be provided
                            under clear-cut plans mutually agreed upon. These plans must be pursued
                            with great vigor on the part of the Vietnamese and with the cooperation
                            of other free nations as well as our own if this job is to be done.</p>
                        <p>Most important, there must be a simultaneous, vigorous and integrated
                            attack on the economic, social and other ills of the Vietnamese peoples.
                            The leadership and initiative in this attack must rest with the
                            Vietnamese leaders. But our aid program must be closely integrated with
                            practical plans of the Vietnamese. The agents of the aid program must
                            work closely with the Vietnamese and their constructive effect will be
                            clearly felt by the Vietnamese people as a whole. It would be most
                            helpful in this connection if the Joint Economic Commission referred to
                            in the communique which was issued in Saigon at the conclusion of my
                            visit could be named and begin to function without delay.</p>
                        <p>There is a serious and immediate challenge to peace and freedom in
                            Vietnam. It can be met if Viet-Nam and this country and other free
                            countries will face it and act vigorously to meet it.</p>

                        <p rend="center">A. General Observations</p>
                        <p>The situation in Viet Nam is more stable than is indicated by newspaper
                            and other reports reaching Washington in recent weeks. Economic
                            conditions within the city of Saigon are at least superficially good and
                            that, in itself for the short run, is a prop to stability. Similarly,
                            conditions in the rural areas are not believed to be desperate, although
                            merchants in Saigon complain in some cases they are unable to supply
                            their normal customers in the provinces due to increased Viet Cong
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>The picture we receive at home has been colored by journalistic
                            sensationalism. It may also be distorted by these other factors: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>An obsessive concern with security on the part of many of our
                                    mission people and a tendency to incorporate this concern into
                                    interpretations of the general situation. After all, occasional
                                    murders in Rock Creek Park, deplorable as they may be, do not
                                    mean that the United States is about to fall apart.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>A conscious or unconscious desire in various quarters to
                                    stimulate the flow of United States aid.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>An excessive reliance by our mission on the evaluations of the
                                    situation by Vietnamese government officials, often checked only
                                    against other government sources or discontented Vietnamese
                                    intellectuals who are in opposition to the present government.
                                    This reliance stems in part at least from the government’s
                                    discouraging of travel by Americans outside Saigon on alleged
                                    grounds of security.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>An assumption, that because conditions have turned bad in Laos
                                    they must inevitably turn bad in Viet Nam.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>To say that conditions in Viet Nam are not as they appear to be in
                            Washington is not to say that they are not serious. There are certainly
                            Viet Minh terrorists in the jungles and rice-paddies. Vietnamese
                            government officials are being assassinated in significant numbers.
                            There is anti-government, non-communist plotting going on in the city of
                            Saigon. Yet, we must keep our perspective. We <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0175"/>must not react in panic and in
                            consequence, perhaps, do precisely that which will worsen the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The perspective which seems closest to reality is that the existing
                            political-military structure based largely on <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName> and a palace bureaucracy
                            in Saigon is not in danger of imminent collapse. That structure is not
                            likely to be suddenly upset except by one or more of the following
                            contingencies: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The removal of Diem through assassination by communist or
                                    non-communist opponents.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The removal of Diem by a palace-military coup-not an
                                    impossibility but an improbability for the present.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The sudden termination or drastic reduction of United States
                                    aid.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>An actual invasion in preponderant force by the Viet Minh from
                                    the North.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Apart from these possibilities there is nevertheless a serious danger in
                            Viet Nam. It is the danger of the progressive disintegration of the
                            government’s hold on the nation. This deterioration can be brought about
                            by a combination of two factors: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The people of Viet Nam, in increasing numbers, may be
                                    terrorized or attracted into the Viet Minh camp.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The government and bureaucracy may fail to maintain and
                                    intensify its responsiveness to the social, economic and
                                    political needs of the people of Viet Nam, particularly in the
                                    rural areas.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Of these two factors, the second may well be of equal, if not greater
                            significance, although it is not so seen by the present government or
                            even by the preponderance of our own official observers.</p>
                        <p>In any event, if the present trend continues, there is the danger that
                            the government will become a glittering facade. It will come to rest in
                            the end, not on its people, but on a modern military establishment and
                            an oriental bureaucracy both maintained for the indefinite future
                            primarily by the United States Treasury. The power which is inherent in
                            the ordinary Vietnamese people will be left to others to organize. In
                            present circumstances, “others” can only be the Communist Vietnamese
                            since there is little promise that effective leadership will emerge from
                            the non-communist opposition to <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh
                                Diem</persName> at this time.</p>
                        <p>If the point of no return in the present trend is reached-that is, if the
                            preponderance of the people move from support of or at least
                            acquiescence in the rule of the government to support of or acquiescence
                            in the Viet Minh movement-a grave dilemma will be posed for our
                            policies. Then, whatever aid we supply to the government to fight
                            communism in the abstract will also be directed, in the specific,
                            against the Vietnamese people. And if we use our own forces to help <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0176"/>put down Communist rebellion in
                            South Viet Nam we will also bear the onus of helping to put down the
                            Vietnamese people.</p>
                        <p>It should be emphasized that this point of no return has not yet been
                            reached. It is probably not even on the immediate horizon despite the
                            panic-type reports that have originated of late in Viet Nam.
                            Nevertheless, the danger flags are flying. One indicator is the increase
                            in Viet Minh terrorists from three or four thousand to 12,000 despite
                            reported heavy casualties inflicted on them by government forces.
                            Another, is the increasing tendency of the palace bureaucracy to isolate
                            itself and President Diem from the people. Still another is the
                            significant level of disaffection with the government which, although to
                            some extent chronic, is present in the highly educated and politically
                            conscious group. While numerically small this group is of importance in
                            Viet Nam. It is the principal recruiting ground for dedicated public
                            servants and high political leaders. Members of this group who are
                            alienated by the government, will move in other directions, first to the
                            non-communist opposition and if that offers no outlet, ultimately, to
                            the Viet Minh. A disturbing number of this group is already in the first
                            stage of alienation.</p>
                        <p>A final indication of the danger is the fact that the ordinary people of
                            the cities and probably even more of the rural areas are starved for
                            leadership with understanding and warmth. There is an enormous popular
                            enthusiasm and great popular power waiting to be brought forth by
                            friendly personal political leadership. But it cannot be evoked by men
                            in white linen suits whose contact with the ordinary people is largely
                            through the rolled-up windows of a Mercedes-Benz.</p>

                            <item>The existing government in Saigon is the only realistic
                                alternative to Viet Minh control in South Viet Nam. At this time,
                                there is no other non-communist leadership which, in all realism,
                                may be expected to replace the present
                                military-political-bureaucratic structure that has been developed in
                                Saigon.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>There is no question of the will of the Diem government and its
                                military forces to resist the Viet Minh communists; there is some
                                question as to their capacity to do so effectively and as to the
                                general efficacy of their present methods. And they certainly cannot
                                resist it without continued and substantial aid.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The need has long been recognized that the government must develop
                                stronger popular support. In theory, the government recognizes this
                                need. In practice, there is grave question that the Vietnamese
                                bureaucracy is now characterized by that degree of <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0177"/>self-dedication and self-sacrifice
                                which would serve to develop such support.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The government appears to be placing increasing reliance on
                                military measures for producing stability and relatively less
                                emphasis on popular political, economic and social measures. To some
                                extent this is inevitable in view of the stepped-up campaign of Viet
                                Minh terrorism. To what extent, however, is not clear. And there are
                                disturbing suggestions that the government not only fears the Viet
                                Cong cadres and terrorists but its own people as well.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Without the increased level of aid that has now been offered
                                clearly the prospect would have been for a progressive but not
                                necessarily rapid deterioration of the position of the Vietnamese
                                government. Nevertheless, this aid is not in itself a guarantee that
                                the deterioration will be checked. It is likely to prove effective
                                only if the military campaign which the aid is designed to produce
                                is pressed with vigor and yet with great discretion. Against the
                                Viet Cong who terrorize the general populace, military force must be
                                firm and powerful. But military force must not be used
                                indiscriminately in an effort to stamp out all resistance to local
                                government officials. Much of this resistance may well be justified
                                as the only outlet against exploitation and oppression. How much, we
                                do not know because the information we have is not adequate. But to
                                the extent that such is the case military action will be costly and,
                                probably increasingly ineffective. The only response which will meet
                                this type of resistance is the redress of the grievances by the
                                efforts of the government itself.</item>

                            <item>There is a great need for more direct and accurate observation and

                            <item>In present circumstances there is no visible solution to the
                                instability in Viet Nam on the basis of neutralization. But if the
                                steps we are now taking work effectively then, in time, the Saigon
                                government may become less dependent on aid and lay a valid claim to
                                represent the entire Vietnamese people, north and south. If the
                                steps fail, however, we shall be able to hold even the present
                                unsatisfactory situation only by larger and larger infusions of aid.
                                Ultimately, perhaps even our direct military involvement may be
                                required to hold the situation, a step which is not sought by the
                                Vietnamese or required by the situation at this time.</item>

                                <item>We should think in terms of a three year plan of increased
                                    aid-military and economic. The plan should be liberal but not
                                    extravagant. We should insist in private and with great tact
                                    that the details of this program be put on paper before the
                                    increased aid flows. The details should include specific
                                    measurable goals, specific responsibilities for the Vietnamese
                                    as well as ourselves, specific techniques, directed to the
                                    improvement of the safety, not only of local officials, but of
                                    the Vietnamese people and the improvement of the livelihood of
                                    these people.</item>

                                <item>We should make clear, in private, that barring an unmistakable
                                    and massive invasion of South Viet Nam from without we have no
                                    intention of employing combat U.S. forces in Viet Nam or using
                                    even naval or air-support which is but the first step in that
                                    direction. If the Vietnamese government backed by a three-year
                                    liberal aid program cannot do this job, then we had better
                                    remember the experience of the French who wound up with several
                                    hundred thousand men in Viet-Nam and were still unable to do it.
                                    And all this, without engaging a single Chinese or Russian.
                                    Before we take any such plunge we had better be sure we are
                                    prepared to become bogged down chasing irregulars and guerillas
                                    over the rice fields and jungles of Southeast Asia while our
                                    principal enemies China and the Soviet Union stand outside the

                                            directed with discretion at the Viet Cong terrorists,
                                            rather than at those who have legitimate grievances. We
                                            must insist at the beginning that the Vietnamese
                                            government permit our representatives and military to go
                                            anywhere at all times in the country, regardless of the
                                            security situation. There will be perhaps some
                                            casualties in this approach but if we are not prepared
                                            to take them in small numbers now, how will we take them
                                            in the great numbers which will be involved if we become
                                            directly involved? This job cannot be done with talk of

                                interest in such new arrangement and on basis Diem’s past attitude
                                toward association with <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> it
                                is questionable that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would be
                                particularly responsive to idea. In past whenever Diem has been
                                asked whether he wishes join <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, his answer has been that Geneva Accord precludes

                                alliance. Diem’s motivation probably is that as <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> protocol state Viet-Nam
                                receives whatever benefits <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>

                            <item>While Diem probably now dubious full membership of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> would take effective action, he
                                has always realistically viewed US as real source <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> strength and thus of guarantee
                                to Viet-Nam under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> protocol.
                                Diem would therefore probably feel that US would be about as likely
                                take action under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, either
                                unilaterally or jointly with those <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers which are willing, as under bilateral
                                arrangement. Under indirect US planning guidance all <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> contingency war plans are based on
                                expressed assumption that US and/or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces will intervene immediately (24-72 hours)
                                after overt attack on <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. This
                                assumption so well established that he would probably therefore view

                            Departmental officer replied decision not yet final, but it appeared
                            unlikely we would seek justify any further increases as being within
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling (although it could be
                            argued as basis <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> increase that

                        <p>Dept officer continued main reason <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            fighting for its existence today was that these restrictions had

                            contravene main purpose Geneva Accords which was to prevent one side
                            from violating the cease-fire and attacking the other. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was being clearly attacked by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> through guerrilla methods; <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> certainly did not intend to cross
                            demarcation line and attack <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Its aim
                            was to defend itself and preserve its independence. In this we intended

                        <p>Action addressees should also point out that U.S.-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> decision not be limited by Articles 16 and 17 would be
                            in accord with recognized principle international law that material
                            breach of a treaty obligation by one party relieves the other of full
                            compliance with its obligations until first party resumes observance (II
                            Yearbook International Law Commission 1959, Articles 18 and 20 on law
                            treaties, pp. 45, 66, 66-71). The U.S. specifically intends that this
                            action will be limited to period during which communists continue
                            violate their treaty obligations. The U.S. will return to complete
                            compliance as soon as the communists discontinue their violations.</p>
                        <p>Addressees should also emphasize that U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> consider <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has
                            continuously breached Article 24 Geneva Accords which states that armed
                            forces each party “shall commit no act and undertake no operation
                            against the other party.” (Copies Geneva Agreement pouched to addressees
                            January 13, 1960.) There is continuing evidence that armed <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> personnel acting under <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> orders have for years traveled from
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> territory into Viet-Nam and
                            carried out hostile acts. The Kontum attack of October, 1960 when
                            several hundred armed persons attacked across the Vietnamese frontier in
                            unit formation is one example.</p>
                        <p>Finally, should emphasize this decision does not reflect desire upset
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> mechanisms. As set forth
                            Department’s 3404 to New Delhi, we believe that mechanism of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> should be perfected. The present
                            situation in Viet-Nam results to some extent from the fact that the

                            has not been able to act effectively. This is why we have urged that the

                            saying President Diem would like for me to accompany him on tour of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then said (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1794<note n="2" xml:id="d64fn2">Telegram 1794, May 24, reported that <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> discussed the introduction of fully equipped
                                U.S. combat units as trainers for the Vietnamese Army with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> on May19 and on two
                                subsequent occasions without result. (Ibid., 751K.5-<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/5-2461)</note>) Diem has carefully
                            considered question introduction of US combat brigade as trainers, and
                            had concluded that this would not be desirable at present time. Diem
                            thought that an addition of up to one thousand <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel, over and above present number, would be
                            desirable and could be accomplished through <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> decision. These, he believed, would suffice for
                            training additional Army units. For training civil guard and
                            self-defense corps, Diem felt that US military personnel in civilian
                            clothes should be used. These would be over and above the number <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> military personnel mentioned
                                above.<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> envisaged direct
                            training.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that we do not wish
                            to proceed against his Government’s judgment in these matters and that I
                            would wish to have General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>’s and Washington’s views before making any final
                            comments; but that certain preliminary comments occurred to me: (1) an
                            obvious relation exists between the number of US trainers needed and the
                            number of Vietnamese forces to be trained, their time-phasing, etc., (2)
                            another factor was how we should decide together to handle the whole
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> matter, especially Articles 16
                            and 17 of Geneva Accords; (3) another factor was whether or not training
                            of civil guard and self-defense corps by US military personnel in
                            civilian clothes was a good idea militarily or politically. I had some
                            doubts on this in light Laotian experiences; (4) still another factor
                            was whether it is a good tactic to argue for an <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>-approved increase in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel when it is apparent that the final
                            requirement is likely to exceed number which <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> will approve. To me, a more forthright approach to
                            problem presented by <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had
                            considerable merit. In summary, I wondered whether the way proposed by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> of meeting the problem
                            was adequate from the military point of view and whether it was good
                            from the political point of view.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> seemed interested in idea
                            that Articles 16 and 17 of the Geneva Accords might be ignored, but
                            worried that this might bring about the abrogation by the Commies of the
                            entire Accords, and/or the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. He said that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            felt that Geneva accords and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had
                            certain deterrent value worth preserving. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> suggested as alternative position that we should
                            work together to sound out opinion of our allies re denunciation of
                            Articles 16 and 17, while at same time proceeding to build up numerical
                            strength of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> under existing
                            regulations. This matter was left inconclusive. <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0186"/>We need Washington reactions to our

                        <p>I then discussed <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s trip to
                            Washington, and asked him tell me the major things that would be taken
                            up in President Diem’s letter to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. He said letter had not yet taken final shape,
                            but would include (a) a request for approval of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> army build up to 100,000 over and above 170,000 already
                            agreed, over two and one-half year period; (b) cost estimates in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and in local currency for a force of
                            that size; (c) some suggestions re long-term economic plan for South
                            VietNam. I told him that we had recently submitted comments to
                            Washington on a possible build-up to 200,000 (increase by 30,000 over
                            present-agreed force); that I did not know what our reaction would be to
                            a larger figure, but that I was sure we would like to hear their
                            considered views and their justification for such a force. My impression
                            was that we were thinking in terms of a phased build-up to see if we
                            went along what the ultimate requirement should be. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said the figure for an additional
                            100,000 came to them from his generals, who had been asked to submit
                            their estimates of what it would take to (a) guard against overt frontal
                            attacks; (b) control borders; and (c) mount successful anti-guerilla
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>I made clear to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, pursuant

                            while our officials in Washington were anxious to hear President Diem’s

                            talks, there would obviously be many matters including cost-sharing, to
                            be worked out specifically and in detail after his return, which could
                            not be done finally in Washington and could be better done here. In

                        <p>I then brought up subject which President Diem had discussed with me at

                                that had been discussed with the Vice President and to evolve a

                                of the discussion at Dalat has been found.</note>— namely, his hope
                            that we could work out together a comprehensive, joint, long-range plan
                            embracing measures in various fields. Diem had stressed the need to have
                            such plans fit the local situation here, rather than having them “made
                            in America”. I told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> I felt
                            sure my Government would be <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0187"/>interested in developing Diem’s thoughts along these lines; we did
                            wish to help in ways which would fit local situation, and I personally
                            thought a high-level joint planning group here would be most useful if
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> wished to suggest it. I said we
                            had a number of ideas in several interrelated fields which could be
                            discussed by such a group, and perhaps then referred to joint
                            subcommittee for detailed study and eventual implementation. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied, while <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> limited re expert personnel, he felt
                            something could and should be done along these lines. Mentioned fact
                            that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would have “opposite numbers”
                            for US financial and economic experts expected around June 17.<note n="7" xml:id="d64fn7">Regarding the establishment of a special group

                            President Diem wished to set one up. (I did this not only because I
                            think it would be best way to have our task force proposals studied
                            systematically, but also to meet Diem’s earlier insistence that plans
                            and actions here should have an indigenous character, in order to
                            promote his basic aim of encouraging a counter-dynamic on the part of

                        <p><gloss target="#t_SGN1">SGN</gloss> 376. Increasing pressure being
                            brought to bear by State Department to bring British, Malayan and other
                            third country trainers into anti-guerrilla training program of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> which is <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s mission. Have pointed out strongly the confusion
                            that will result if coordinated counter-insurgency doctrine and training
                            which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has developed, using best of
                            other country experience applicable here, should now be redirected and
                            diluted by individual third country trainers with different concepts and
                            methods. Diem had assured me these third country trainers in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> field not desired. However,
                            Ambassador here and <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken Young</persName> new
                            Ambassador Thai land leaving for Washington visit today making concerted
                            effort change Diem’s mind by indicating <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> has much to learn from British and Australians. I do not
                            agree and am [not?] certain history would show U.S. had to be “bailed
                            out” by them as in past. I am <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0189"/>unable here to pin down “<persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> group” qualifications and, more important, its
                            authority; only that they are anti-guerrilla “experts.” Feel we must
                            insist they convince us by furnishing concrete anti-guerrilla material
                            for our evaluation and consideration before we approve their coming.
                            Also, if State forces it, that it must be understood any actions by them
                            in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> field are controlled by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Now that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has fought through major
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> reorganization and
                            strengthening of command structure, taken over Civil Guard training, and
                            gotten approval on a long overdue 20,000 <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> increase, we are just beginning to show positive
                            results as manifested by increasing offensive operations against Viet
                            Cong. I am convinced US prestige as well as that of US military will
                            suffer in Southeast Asia if third country individuals are to be forced
                            into <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> field here. I have no
                            objection to their operations in other fields and this is already mostly
                            agreed by the country team. This should suffice to “show the flag.” If
                            State Department insistence result of political expediency, then believe
                            strongly Defense Department must, to protect itself, go on record that
                            we are now progressing in a military sense and have already set the
                            stage organization and strength-wise for further successes. New approach
                            by <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Ken Young</persName> here yesterday with
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and me was have
                            “international counter-guerrilla warfare school,” which has been
                            considered by Washington Task Force, for location somewhere in Far East
                            definitely located South Vietnam. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            is resisting this maneuver for reasons above and in addition, because
                            feel it will conflict with and retard our hot war effort by sowing seeds
                            of doubt our methods with other countries trying to get into act
                            operationally. Better results obtainable by location of “international
                            counter-guerrilla warfare school” in say Malaya, with field research
                            work here by its “students.” I am convinced participation by third
                            country trainers would be militarily counter-productive <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s mission here.</p>
                        <p>As a fall back position, if forced to have “international
                            counter-guerrilla warfare school,” in Vietnam, believe we could possibly
                            compromise on Asian trainers, such as Filipinos and Chinese
                            Nationalists, as they really knowledgeable, would be more acceptable to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, mix better ethnically and would
                            not downgrade US effort to extent British participation.</p>
                        <p>Augmentation of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is being delayed
                            by US failure so far to assure the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            of the necessary defense support funds as differentiated from <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds already promised. While
                            admittedly an economic problem, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            high officials say they cannot by themselves finance the local currency
                            costs of the 20,000 augmentation presently approved, the 30,000
                            additional augmentation proposed nor the 100,000 augmentation to achieve
                            the requisite 15 <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0190"/>division force
                            which they are convinced they need and with which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> analysis agrees, all concurrently
                            with maintaining paramilitary forces which they also supporting local
                            currency-wise. In view <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> economic
                            base, cannot expect <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> carry this added
                            security load. In addition attempting this would result serious
                            curtailment of Diem’s economic and social programs. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> attitude here apparently strongly
                            supported by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and State in Washington
                            is to sit by and wait for Special Financial Group (<gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss>) to arrive and analyze economic and
                            financial situation. This could take months and every day the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> mobilization is further delayed is
                            dangerous. These fiscal and diplomatic types fail or refuse to realize
                            the time lag for training and equipping military forces.</p>
                        <p>In view feeling by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that we have not
                            lived up to our commitments in the past, following on heels of
                            deteriorating Laos situation and Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s statements here, more delay
                            could well trigger an attitude of neutralism in both the military and

                        <p>We made it clear that final resolution of aid level for 1962 and
                            subsequent years could not be accomplished until <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> advice available and funds voted for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962. We very much hoped, however, that
                            during this summer we and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could
                            agree on a sound long-term financial plan. Meanwhile, I hoped nothing
                            would be allowed to interfere with build-up of forces to 20,000 agreed
                            increase as fast as possible. This was regarded as necessary by both
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US. Was it true, I asked,
                            that the build-up of the 20,000 was being delayed for financial
                            reasons?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said, yes, inductions are
                            now being deferred since <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does not
                            have funds to take on additional obligations. I emphasized that we were
                            not trading, but exploring possibilities within framework of our mutual
                            desire to raise 20,000 troops as quickly as possible. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then threw out proposal that
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should finance as much of 20,000
                            increment as could be raised for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 61,
                            but said this would have to be done at cost of stand-still on certain
                            economic-military-social projects now under way (mentioning roads,
                            canals, and land development). I told him that US considers many of
                            these projects as necessary in the fight against the Viet Cong, and that
                            I do not wish at this time to be in position of recommending priorities
                            between necessary projects. This proposal of <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s was later withdrawn, after <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget man had pointed out that
                            transfer of funds from other budget appropriations to military is not
                            possible during current year (for reasons, we assume, appropriation
                            law).</p>
                        <p>I persisted in exploring ways to continue inductions for the 20,000 and
                            to finding method to pay for them without further loss of time. We
                            calculated the sum involved to be about <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $350 million for the remainder calendar year 1961.
                            Having withdrawn his original suggestion, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then said that there were only two ways to meet
                            this problem: (1) By borrowing from National Bank; (2) By cash grant
                            from US. The first course <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rejected
                            as inflationary, and likely to cause criticism from <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> authorities due soon for annual
                            consultations. The second alternative, I said, appeared impractical from
                            our side, for reasons of lack of funds and on principle (i.e., cash
                            grant in relation to over-all balance of payments position). As a
                            personal suggestion, in order to solve the problem of 1961 payments
                            without further loss of time and without prejudice to <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> and subsequent negotiations, I threw
                            out the following: (1) That the cost for 1961 for the additional 20,000
                            be calculated as precisely as possible; (2) That <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> then might suggest in Washington
                            that the cost be divided between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s
                            own funds and remaining counterpart and other US-controlled
                            availabilities. (An agreed table of <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0193"/>counterpart, Section 402<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">For

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> thought this idea had
                            possibilities. I made clear that I could make no commitments. (Comments:
                            I urge that this matter be cleared up promptly, either in Washington or
                            on instructions here, in order that agreed force increase be not further
                            delayed and to clear decks for study and negotiation on future program,
                            perhaps involving much larger forces. To do so, in my judgment, would
                            preserve and build confidence, keep up momentum, and enable us to work
                            much more effectively in future negotiations.)</p>
                        <p>In responding to point that we consider it necessary to maintain economic
                            projects which were part and parcel of counter-insurgency effort,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was taking steps to improve tax
                            collections and back up certain tax rates. Tax revenues estimated by
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to rise by <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> $600 million in 1961 over 1960. Forecasts
                            of exports and budget details requested by <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in April were still not available. We urged that they
                            be ready soon for <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> study; exports for
                            1961 were estimated by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at $70
                            million compared to $85 in 1960. We also requested breakdown proposed US
                            aid-financed import list of $169 for fiscal 1962.</p>
                        <p>These discussions, I think, were useful in bringing clarification and
                            perhaps in drawing positions together. Both Diem and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> mentioned their usefulness to me
                            today (June 9). I repeat that we have not made any financial commitments
                            here, and will not do so pending further instructions.</p>

                                    1945-1967</hi>, Book 11, pp. 167-173.</note> The President read
                            the letter carefully and then explained to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> that the letter requested
                            U.S. support for an increase in the Vietnamese armed forces to a total
                            of 270,000 men and that the cost of providing initial equipment for this
                            increase in the size of the armed forces would come to about $175
                            million dollars, to be distributed over the 2Y2 year period needed to
                            activate these units and that thereafter annual maintenance for this
                            force would increase the military assistance program by about $20
                            million dollars a year.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            how much of the communist movement in Viet-Nam was indigenous. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that during the
                            Indo-China War the French had occupied only the cities and main roads.
                            This had permitted the communists to occupy the country side and
                            exercise their subversive influence over the population. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> also mentioned the flow of Viet
                            Cong from North Viet-Nam to VietNam, stating that Vietnamese armed
                            forces had recently occupied reception centers on Route 9 which had been
                            used by the Communists. Records in these reception centers showed that
                            about 2,800 men had moved through them on their way south to Viet-Nam
                            during a 4 month period.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked about cooperation with Cambodia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> spoke of Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>’s “versatile” qualities and
                            commented that if Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>’s policies appeared to be changeable it should be
                            remembered that they were based on one unchanging assumption, namely
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>’s belief that the
                            communists would win in Asia, and that he must tailor his policies
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The President then inquired about living conditions in North VietNam. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> explained that life for
                            the average citizen in North Viet-Nam was extremely difficult, that food
                            and clothing were hard to obtain and that morale was low. The President
                            then asked about the problems of infiltrating Vietnamese forces into
                            North VietNam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied
                            that a few highly trained troops were available but that if Viet-Nam
                            were to risk these men in an attempt to stir up unrest in North VietNam,
                            the United States should be prepared to make a major effort to give them
                            the full support needed to carry out such an action to a successful
                            conclusion. The President then asked about the war in South VietNam. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that the South
                            Vietnamese troops were having increasing success in their fight against
                            the Viet Cong. An interesting index of this success Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said was that although the
                            Vietnamese troops were kept on the line for long periods their rate of
                                <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0196"/>desertion was very low, and
                            that those deserted did not desert to the Viet Cong but only to return
                            home to see their families. On the other hand he said there had been
                            increasingly large numbers of Viet Cong who had surrendered. As one of
                            the difficulties faced by his country Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> cited the length of the land and sea frontiers to
                            be protected.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked how long it would take to get started on the
                            20,000 man increase in the Vietnamese armed forces from 150,000 to
                            170,000. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> explained that
                            there has been a 6,000 man increase but that unfortunately the
                            Vietnamese simply did not have the liquid assets necessary to pay the
                            local costs of continuing this increase to 170,000. Vietnamese finances
                            he continued had been stretched to the point where it had recently been
                            necessary for them to cancel the International Fair scheduled for 1962
                            near Saigon. After further discussion it was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> would report to the
                            President on the following day as to how this matter could be resolved
                            in order to continue the mobilization as rapidly as possible.</p>
                        <p>The President then discussed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> President Diem’s request for support in increasing
                            the Vietnamese army to 270,000. He asked that President Diem’s letter be
                            made immediately available to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> who was testifying before the Senate the same
                            day, in order that the Senators could better understand and appreciate
                            the magnitude of the task involved in helping Viet-Nam to maintain its
                            independence. In discussing the share which Viet-Nam might pay the
                            President asked if it was not true that Viet-Nam had a foreign exchange
                            reserve of over $200 million. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said it was true but he expressed his government’s
                            fear that if this reserve were drawn down below the $200 million mark
                            most of the capital in Viet-Nam which was primarily foreign owned
                            (French and Chinese) would find ways of leaving the country and thereby
                            cause a serious economic situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> also said that the Vietnamese government had
                            already drawn down its foreign exchange reserve by $6 million.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked whom Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> would see during his visit in Washington and
                            particularly suggested that he see some Republican Senators, notably
                            Dirksen and Hickenlooper, as he felt this might be useful in the
                            extremely difficult struggle which would be involved in obtaining the
                            funds requested by President Diem.</p>
                        <p>The President also said that we should continue to increase the size of
                            our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in order to handle speedily
                            the training of the Vietnamese troops and that this increase should be
                            done quietly without publicly indicating that we did not intend to abide
                            by the Geneva Accords.</p>

                            <item>At the end of the Indo-China war, South Viet-Nam was politically,
                                economically and militarily weak and a ripe target for Communist
                                expansion. High level analysts concluded that unless the South
                                Vietnamese showed an inclination to make individual and collective
                                sacrifices, which they had not made as of that time, no amount of
                                external assistance could long delay complete Communist victory in
                                So. Vietnam. As a point of fact, after the passage of seven years,
                                the Communists have not been successful in taking over So. Vietnam.
                                I would suggest that there are three reasons why they have not been

                            <item>The internal problems facing Diem in 1954 ranged from nearly
                                complete demoralization of the nation in general and the armed
                                forces in particular, to seemingly inevitable unification with North
                                Viet-Nam which would have resulted in Communist domination over all
                                of Vietnam. However, in the late spring of 1955, Diem managed to
                                work a minor miracle by standing up against the sects-the Binh
                                Xuyen, Hoa Hao, and Cao Dai-contrary to recommendations of his key
                                advisers. He had been urged to accommodate with these groups,
                                allowing them concessions and a continuation of their essentially
                                feudalistic privileges in exchange for their tolerance of his govt
                                and avoidance of deals with the Viet Cong. Diem’s moralistic stand
                                on this issue won him wide support among Vietnamese intellectuals
                                and attentistes and also favorably affected international

                                pause for thought, made the Communists realize that So. Viet-Nam was
                                ready to fight for her freedom and provided the loyal So. Vietnamese
                                with a renewed confidence in the govt’s ability to provide for their

                            <item>When the Jul 1956 unification deadline approached, Diem again
                                displayed wise leadership. Despite remonstrances from the French and
                                others, he circumvented the issue by the simple device of
                                maintaining that the French, not the Vietnamese, had made the
                                commitment and that Viet-Nam would not be bound thereby. Diem was
                                able to take this strong stand solely by virtue of his growing power
                                assets, the most conspicuous element of which was his armed forces
                                in being, by this time solely supported by the US. It can be
                                hypothesized that Diem’s ability to circumvent an undoubtedly
                                disastrous unification in 1956 was possible only because of US
                                support-military and otherwise-of So. Vietnam.</item>

                            <item>By Jul 1957, the Communists’ passive and political efforts had
                                been frustrated by Diem’s action, and the Viet Cong concluded that a
                                change in strategy was necessary. The Viet Cong strength in armed
                                personnel at this time was about 2000. Their new objective was to
                                create a lack of confidence in the ability of Diem’s govt to
                                guarantee security. A reign of terror was substituted for peaceful
                                penetration, acts of terrorism were started against local govt
                                officials and the peasantry, murders and abductions were an integral
                                part of this strategy of terror. Fortunately, this change of tactic
                                did not take place until after Diem had achieved a considerable
                                degree of military and political stability. Further, economic
                                reforms introduced by Diem gave him increased support from the
                                populace. This stability provided Diem a base from which he could
                                fight the Communists. Without military and economic assistance, the
                                development of this base would not have been possible.</item>

                            26 regarding financing 20,000 army increase for 1961. I told him (para
                            b-1 <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss><gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>) that I <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0208"/>was now
                            authorized to make available 178.5 million piasters from US-controlled
                            sources provided <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> continues
                            mobilization at full speed and on understanding that balance of 1961
                            military budget would be met from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            resources. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that this
                            offer had already been made when he was in Washington, that he had said
                            then that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was unable to fill
                            remaining gap, but that nevertheless <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            had moved ahead on mobilization as he had agreed to do in Washington. He
                            said that he had upon his return again looked into <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s budgetary situation and had found the
                            cupboard bare; it was for this reason that they had been forced to
                            cancel the international fair. While he had in good faith given me
                            impression before his departure to Washington that problem might be
                            solved by roughly 50-50 split of additional costs (i.e., by use $5.1
                            million equivalent plus <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> funds), it
                            was now unfortunately true that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            could not make up the difference nor any part thereof. They simply did
                            not have the funds, he said. I told him that neither I nor my government
                            wanted to take advantage of the fact that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was moving ahead on mobilization; nor did we wish to
                            put squeeze on other essential programs required to win battle in
                            VietNam. However, the only available funds were those mentioned.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that this left him
                            in an extremely exposed position; that the possibility of an increase in
                            aid (amount unspecified) had been mentioned in Washington; and that he
                            had confirmed that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would not put up
                            additional funds.</p>
                        <p>In studying instructions beforehand, I had decided, after talking with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Staley</persName>, that it would be
                            unwise to use positions <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss>-2 and <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss>-3 because of their exchange rate feature,
                            which would be prejudicial to <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss>’s work
                            and predictably unacceptable at this stage to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Nevertheless, I did try out alternative 2, i.e.,
                            conversion of $12.6 million balance at <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            $73.5 to US $1, plus customs and taxes. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he would not be able to close the gap on this
                            basis; that he hoped the <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> could work
                            out some arrangement for future financing which would give a more
                            realistic piaster yield for imports and would be acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, but he simply could not prejudge that
                            issue in context of this problem. If he did, he said, he could not get
                            it approved.</p>
                        <p>During discussion <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> showed me,
                            as evidence <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s good faith, a chart of
                            proposed tax increases for 1962 to be presented to the national
                            assembly. Unable to agree, we left it that we would meet again on
                            problem in a couple of days.</p>
                        <p>I did not use alternative 3.</p>
                        <p>As <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> apparently expects
                            additional dollar aid based on conversations in Washington, and it is
                            not yet timely to discuss higher rates of conversion (changes in rates
                            cannot be broached now without prejudicing <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> studies) believe advisable proffer additional <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0209"/>aid now. Can be done if <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> receives immediate allotments. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> proposes pay entire amount for
                            industrial equipment.</p>
                        <p>Following is proposed negotiating line for which prompt approval
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>Estimated 500,000,000 piasters required meet <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> expansion balance 1961. (This estimate may prove to be
                            high in light rate of induction and other factors undetermined at this
                            time. If so, can be adjusted in 1962 aid figures. But optimum induction
                            should be provided for at this time.) Can meet 200,000,000 piasters from
                            remaining unprogrammed counterpart. Remaining 300,000,000 can be
                            generated by present rate 35 plus 8 customs duties plus production taxes
                            say 7 piasters, by allotment $6,000,000.</p>
                        <p>Therefore propose proceed pay 12.6 million final 1961 allotment on usual
                            terms (which must do by June 30 to prevent lapse funds) and provide
                            additional $6 million for above-specified purposes.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing will not prejudice <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss>
                            operations (although <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> will doubtless
                            take $6 million into account) but would be proffered to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> without prejudice to basis of future
                            calculations of appropriate aid levels.</p>
                        <p>Please advise soonest, as this matter needs to be cleared up promptly if
                            momentum and confidence to be maintained.</p>

                            grave problem which in our view clearly involved violations of the
                            Geneva Agreements by the Communist side. In this connection we had
                            reached a decision recently, because of the Communist violations and
                            their stepping up of infiltration and subversion, that it was necessary
                            to increase the strength of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            Viet-Nam by about 100. This was done solely because the Communist
                            violations made a step-up of training <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces necessary. Our action did not mean that we did
                            not respect the Geneva Agreements of 1954 or that we intended to push
                            aside any part of these Agreements, even Articles 16 and 17. It was
                            necessary, however, to have a freer hand to cope with the violations by
                            the Communist side. The addition of the 100 personnel did not increase
                            the strength of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to the point where
                            it would become a public issue. It might be necessary, however, to go
                            higher in the future. This would involve only the minimum number
                            necessary. We hoped <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0214"/>that such
                            an increase would not be necessary but that would depend on what the
                            Communists did. We felt it most important to inform the Indian
                            Government of this decision and our view of the situation because of the
                            extremely important role India has played and is playing with regard to
                            affairs in the Southeast Asia area. This included India’s part in the
                            present conference concerning Laos as well as in the earlier Geneva
                            Conference and in the International Commission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> thanked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> for the
                            information and commented that presumably the additional 100 personnel,
                            or whatever the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> might amount to in
                            numbers, merely indicated a stepping-up of the training effort and not
                            that the American personnel would don uniforms and fight. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName>’s interpretation was
                            completely correct. There was no intention at all of having the
                            Americans take over the fighting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> continued that he
                            had asked this because of the reports concerning Laos where it was said
                            that American officers had been sent directly to the front with the
                            local forces. He wished to raise one other point. Because of the
                            possibility of escalation he wondered whether the US intended to “hit
                            North Viet-Nam in kind.” When he talked recently with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">No
                                record of this conversation has been found.</note> the latter had
                            been much exercised over the situation where cadres, potential leaders
                            in South VietNam, were being wiped out by the Communist action and had
                            indicated that he felt it essential to take stronger countermeasures
                            against the source of the problem. Certain press reports had also
                            suggested that we might be thinking of retaliation in kind against North
                            VietNam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> said that of
                            course he could not answer for all contingencies in the future, but the
                            assignment of this group of 100 personnel to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had no relation to such a change of policy. They were
                            intended to improve the training of the Vietnamese forces for
                            counter-guerrilla action. While we have to preserve our freedom of
                            action as regards possible contingencies, there was no plan to take
                            action at this time of the sort Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> had inquired about and this increase was not
                            related to any action of that kind.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> remarked that after
                            his talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, he had
                            informed the Ministry of External Affairs. He expected to be seeing Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> again on this subject.
                            One of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>’s main
                            complaints was that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> was not
                            really fulfilling its functions by investigating all complaints of
                            violations. He felt he should point out two matters in this regard.
                            First, the American attitude was based on <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0215"/>the view that whenever a complaint against North
                            Viet-Nam was filed, the North Vietnamese objected and this blocked any
                            action by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Information he had
                            received from India confirmed that North Viet-Nam had done this but that
                            South Viet-Nam had actually done it on more occasions. He did not have
                            complete information but believed that the Ministry might be assembling
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> asked Mr.
                                <persName>Ainsworth</persName> whether our information confirmed
                            this. Mr. <persName>Ainsworth</persName> said that we had had reports
                            that the Vietnamese Government had on several occasions objected to
                            proposals for <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> investigations within
                            its territory, but suggested that there seemed to be a considerable
                            difference between the substance of the proposed investigations in
                            complaints filed against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and
                            those filed against the Communist side. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> took the view that not being a signatory to the Geneva
                            Agreements, its cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            was a voluntary act on its part.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> said that the
                            second of his points was that the Indian Government had now told the
                            Indian Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> (in fact long
                            before his conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>) that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            must investigate complaints and that obstacles by either government were
                            no excuse for inaction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> had asked the Ministry for further details.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> plans to get in touch
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> to
                            discuss these questions at length. The problem was not that the Indians
                            ignored complaints but that the Poles in particular made things
                            extremely difficult and in fact the Canadians were also difficult on
                            some occasions. When the Poles and Canadians each took a rigid position
                            on a subject, Gopala Menon and some others had tended to take a middle
                            position regardless of the merits of the issue. India hoped to correct
                            this tendency but it would be difficult if both sides continued to take
                            inflexible polar positions. He hoped that if the Indians’ attitude had
                            appeared negative before, it would be more positive now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName>’s attitude should be a great help
                            in this respect. As for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, it is a
                            fact that it exists. A quantitative augmentation in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was one thing, but a qualitative
                            change such as would be involved in a significant alteration of its
                            functions was quite another and would be likely to give an excuse for
                            the neighbor to the North to come in. One may overestimate the Chinese
                            Communists either as to their capabilities or as to their inclinations
                            to embark on aggressive adventures, or both, but on our side we must be
                            careful not to give them unwarranted excuses for such action. It seems
                            that the military sometimes are likely to take the bit in their teeth
                            and run. A partisan war (of which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> said he had had some experience in the sense
                            of having spent some time in the jungle on the CBI front in World War
                            II) presents special problems and this is often likely to lead to a
                            situation where the obvious military solution appears to be attacking
                                <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0216"/>the home base of enemy
                            forces as was the case in Kashmir and in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> observed that with
                            us the military would not make the fundamental decisions on such
                            questions by themselves. Even in the case at hand of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> increase, care had been exercised
                            that the number which was traditionally regarded as the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling was not exceeded. We shall
                            take the minimum action necessary to deal with the problems we face.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow three paragraphs on the situation in Laos.]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> said that he
                            desired to clarify his earlier reference to a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> “ceiling”. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            strength was not now over what had traditionally and unofficially been
                            regarded as the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> “ceiling” but we
                            could not tie our hands. Mr. <persName>Ainsworth</persName> observed
                            that according to our understanding the most recent <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> communication on the subject of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> (which had been a letter to the
                            Vietnamese Government) had not said anything about a specific numerical
                            “ceiling” for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Consequently when
                            we mentioned a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling we were
                            simply speaking in general terms and did not mean to imply that we felt
                            that a specific figure had been set in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> replied that the
                            numbers of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> were less important
                            than its quality and the role it played. There was also the matter of
                            one’s over-all assessment of the situation. Mr.
                                <persName>Krapf</persName>, the German Minister in Washington, had
                            recently remarked that the Russian national game was chess, the American
                            national game was baseball. This might have some significance in terms
                            of the difference in habits between rapid reflex action and long range
                            planning. It was often hard to tell which move on a chess board was
                            really the significant one. At the present time, to return to the
                            baseball metaphor, there appeared to be quite a number of balls flying
                            about, what with Laos, Berlin, etc. Walter Lippman had also stressed
                            that one should never get held or committed by a move in one part of the
                            map. As for the Chinese, his (<persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName>’s) view was that they generally play in their
                            own court unless they think they can get a quick victory. Thus they had
                            moved into Ladakh which was easy but would be most unlikely to move
                            seriously against India proper. Concerning VietNam, the Chinese would
                            weigh the factors carefully but any development which would give them an
                            excuse to move in there would be a great temptation. They obviously had
                            strong capabilities in the area and it would give them a chance, which
                            he believed they would welcome, to chasten <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>. It was certainly not desirable to have
                            another Korea. In a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> the quantity
                            was less important than quality, it was important not to give the
                            Chinese an excuse. The people of South VietNam, he continued, would be
                            our most valuable ally against the Communists. <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0217"/>Diem was still completely dependent on
                            the US. It would be most helpful if the Vietnamese could display more
                            initiative on their own which would make them a true ally. North
                            Viet-Nam was certainly no attraction to them. It was by all accounts a
                            completely drab area. As regards South VietNam, a combined political and
                            military solution was needed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> observed that we also hope that measures
                            would be taken to increase the political incentive for a more active
                            Vietnamese popular participation in the struggle against the Communist
                            subversion. Diem had already taken some steps, which we thought should
                            be useful in this respect.</p>
                        <p>On the way to the street, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> explained to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRB1">Horgan</persName> that one reason he raised the question of our
                            “hitting North Viet-Nam in kind” was that the Soviet Embassy had
                            conveyed to him the Soviet impression that the US had this intention. He
                            had not mentioned this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> because he had not been able to assess the
                            Soviet purpose in telling him this: whether it was merely argumentative;
                            or whether it was a matter of serious concern to the Soviets which they
                            presumed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CDN1">Chatterjee</persName> would
                            convey to the US.</p>

                                <item>He referred to the present <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> sweep in Vinh Binh province and asked
                                    pointedly what would be done to insure that after this operation
                                    was over the Viet Cong would be kept out of Vinh Binh province.
                                    Did the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> have plans and
                                    capabilities of keeping the area clean after the sweep was over.
                                    I pointed out that Vinh Binh province was between two rivers and
                                    the sea but said that I had no information as to future plans
                                    for keeping the province sterile.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I said that in general terms we regretted that there was no plan based on
                            the geography of Viet-Nam for sweeping the country clean, and pointed
                            out that Thompson had made a report to the Vietnamese government in

                            Malaya. I said that you and I had discussed this and were in agreement
                            that such framing operations should start in Saigon which was the
                            ultimate target of the Viet Cong and move northwestward on the road to
                            Phnom Penh up to the Cambodian border and the Tay Ninh salient which was
                            one of the worst bases for Viet Cong operations. Thereafter the framing
                            operation could be extended northeast-southwest along the Cambodian
                            border.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> jumped to his feet and said
                            “This is the first time I have heard a practical suggestion as to how we
                            should carry out our operations in VietNam”. He asked that the Task
                            Force prepare a telegram for Saigon inquiring about a plan for
                            operations to push the Viet Cong out of Viet-Nam and said that we should
                            query them about the <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            plan concept. I agreed to do so.<note n="4" xml:id="d80fn4">At this
                                point on the source text, the words “on the condition that we did

                        <p>Later Bob Johnson said that he and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> were also concerned as to whether the command
                            structure set up by Diem was really working or whether Diem was still
                            running everything himself in a rather haphazard manner. I pointed out
                            that the counter-insurgency plan enabled us to check from time to time
                            as to whether the Vietnamese were living up to their end of the bargain
                            before we made further commitments and suggested that we put in as two
                            prerequisites to a 200,000 man increase (1) a requirement for an overall
                            strategic plan for ridding Viet-Nam of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and (2) assurance that the chain of command concept was

                        <p>The Department of Defense, as directed by National Security Memorandum

                                52</ref>.</note> has made an assessment of the military utility of a
                            further increase in South Vietnamese armed forces from 170,000 to
                            200,000. It is our view that with the present deteriorating situation in
                            Southeast Asia it is in the best interests of the United States to
                            support in principle this increase in the force structure for Viet-Nam
                            to provide for two divisions or their equivalent (including necessary
                            Naval and Air Force augmentation). With the critical increase of
                            Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, the present military posture of
                            North Vietnam, and the Communist potential resulting from the expansion
                            of Communist controlled <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0220"/>areas
                            in Laos, a 30,000-man increase in South Vietnamese forces is
                            justified.</p>
                        <p>Such an increase, which would require additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and Defense Support type funding, would permit
                            activation of the two additional infantry divisions requested by
                            President Diem in his letter of 9 June 1961 to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d82fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d69fn3">footnote 3, Document 69</ref>.</note>
                            Since President Diem envisages an eventual increase of the force level
                            to 270,000, it should be made clear that U.S. approval of the 30,000-man
                            increment would not imply U.S. acceptance of the 270,000 force
                            level.</p>
                        <p>This increase of 30,000 should not be initiated until the currently
                            authorized increase of 20,000 is properly amalgamated into the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> force structure. It is our view that
                            the additional increase should proceed only as rapidly as the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is capable to receive, support,
                            administer, train, and maintain forces in being as well as to provide
                            for the increase.</p>

                            men.</p>
                        <p>The President asks that the appropriate officials consider sending to
                            Viet-Nam a qualified military group which would study the VietNamese
                            request for additional soldiers. This U.S. group would be able to supply
                            to the President its informed judgment as to whether the U.S. should
                            assist Diem to increase his army by 100,000. In the President’s view,
                            the military survey group should be <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0221"/>in Viet-Nam before the economic group headed by Dr.

                            study. The President is interested in knowing what share of the cost of
                            equipping and maintaining 100,000 additional men would be borne by the
                            U.S. He noted that the 20,000 increase of VietNamese forces was to be
                            jointly financed.</p>
                        <p>The President commented, in discussing who should undertake the military
                            survey, that it would probably not be possible for General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to go to Viet-Nam at this

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I have read with care your letters of May 15 and June 9<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">See <ref target="#d55fn4">footnotes 4, Document

                            you and your people are facing. Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> has told me of the valor of the
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>In view of the communist menace in Viet-Nam and of the serious threat
                            posed to your country by the situation in southern Laos, both of which
                            were set forth cogently in your second letter, I am very pleased to
                            learn that the process of increasing the armed forces of Viet-Nam from
                            150,000 to 170,000 was recommenced recently, before a final
                            understanding on financing had been reached. I am also gratified to know
                            that on June 29 your government <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0222"/>reached agreement with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> on the joint financing of this increase.<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">See <ref target="#d77fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    77</ref>.</note> Due to the gravity of the situation and to the
                            Vietnamese government’s willingness to go ahead with this increase in
                            its armed forces even before the question of joint financing had been
                            settled, we have sought to be as cooperative as possible.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, as the mobilization to 170,000 is continuing, the Department
                            of Defense is urgently studying your request for support in a further
                            long term increase to a 270,000 man force. In addition to exploring the
                            usefulness, methods and procedures of such an increase we will both have
                            to give the most careful attention to the large amount of funds which
                            such an increase will involve for our two countries. I hope that the
                            findings of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Eugene Staley</persName> may
                            provide helpful guidelines for both our Governments.</p>
                        <p>Returning to your letter of June 9 I was gratified to read of the
                            determined and intelligent efforts being made to continue the economic
                            and particularly the educational progress which Viet-Nam has made
                            despite the Communist campaign of violence. Such programs are among the
                            basic developments which will nourish the aspirations of the Vietnamese.
                            I have also noted the new political institutions which were mentioned in
                            your letter. I hope that these institutions and others like them will be
                            strengthened by the participation of the rising generation and that they
                            will have a healthy growth.</p>
                        <p>As to Cambodia, the communist threat to Southeast Asia would appear to
                            clearly outweigh all other considerations and to necessitate improved
                            relations among the free nations of the area. Would it not be in the
                            interests of your Government to seek accommodation with Cambodia on the
                            questions of improved border control and the settlement of the debts
                            which are outstanding under the Paris Accords? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> is at your disposition should
                            you wish to discuss the matter further.</p>
                        <p>In closing I would like to affirm to you in the strongest terms that we
                            support your government’s determination to resist communist aggression
                            and to maintain its independence.</p>
                        <p>We admire the courage and tenacity displayed by the Government and people
                            of Viet-Nam and particularly by their President.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards,</p>

                                Johnson gave the following appraisal of the

                        <p>“The answers look generally all right to me. I do think that the Soviets
                            would think several times about creating simultaneous crises in Berlin
                            and South Viet Nam. They might have considerable trouble managing two
                            crises at once, particularly in view of the fact that North Viet-Nam and
                            Communist China have different interests in the Viet Nam situation.
                            Moreover, they would probably worry about our ability to handle two
                            crises simultaneously. They might fear that such a situation would
                            produce a convulsive reaction on our part or other forms of irrational,
                            unpredictable behavior.”</p>

                                        <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> expressed the
                                    view that “we were in a brief interval before great heat might
                                    be put on us in Viet Nam, and he wouldn’t be surprised if it
                                    should come to a head at the time of the Berlin crisis.”
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> also expressed
                                    concern about the effectiveness of Diem’s administrative
                                    proposals and that <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>’s support of these proposals reflected
                                    “desperation.” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                                    urged that “we should not look just on the surface of the
                                    request for 100,000 men, but look beneath it, and should really
                                    figure out where we stand and what we do.” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> suggested that if the
                                    President went ahead with his plans to name <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> as his military
                                    adviser, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> “might
                                    go out and take a thorough look on the ground at the military
                                    administrative program.” Johnson agreed with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>’s idea that the U.S.
                                    Government should prepare for the contingency that the Viet-Nam
                                    question would be raised in the United Nations by assembling
                                    evidence and preparing a case. Johnson said that “the material
                                    was around but had not been assembled for that particular
                                    purpose.” (Department of State, Johnson Files, Telephone

                        <p>In the reference conversation Professor <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> raised certain questions which Ben Wood and I
                            would answer as follows:</p>
                        <p>Q: Will not the communists put great heat on VietNam, perhaps timed for a
                            crisis over Berlin?</p>
                        <p>Ans: We think this very possible. They might also time the “heat” to
                            coincide with the end of the Geneva Conference on Laos.</p>
                        <p>Q: How are Diem’s administrative “reorganizations” progressing? Is he
                            continuing to operate everything from his own desk?</p>
                        <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0224"/>
                        <p>Ans: Reports indicate that Diem still exercises a tight, personal control
                            but we hope this may be loosened gradually within the framework of the
                            new organizations.</p>
                        <p>Q: Diem is now asking for a 100,000 force increase above our agreed
                            170,000. <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> s
                                endorsement<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">See <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>.</note> sounds tike desperation. In reviewing
                            this request, should we not look beneath the surface and figure out
                            where we stand?</p>
                        <p>Ans: The President has informed Diem (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 8 of July 3<note n="4" xml:id="d85fn4"><ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref>.</note>) that “the Department of
                            Defense is urgently studying your request for support in a further long
                            term increase to a 270,000 man force. In addition to exploring the
                            usefulness, methods and procedures of such an increase we will both have
                            to give the most careful attention to the large amount of funds which
                            such an increase will involve for our two countries. I hope that the
                            findings of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Eugene Staley</persName> may
                            provide helpful guidelines for both our Governments.”</p>
                        <p>At the present rate of mobilization the Vietnamese armed forces will not
                            reach 170,000 until February 1962. This gives us time to study further
                            increases. We believe that the following prerequisites to further
                            increases in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> should be obtained:
                            (a) assurances from Task Force Saigon after consultation with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that the reforms which have been
                            decreed in Viet-Nam to tighten the chain of command and to unify the
                            intelligence function are actually being implemented, (b) that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the Vietnamese military work out
                            an overall geographical strategic plan for driving the Viet Cong out of
                            VietNam, (c) agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                            after the Staley recommendations are received, on the basis of cost
                            sharing between the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above affirmative action on the part of Diem, the
                            question is whether a 270,000 force level makes any sense. The arguments

                        <p>On July 8, 1961, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> was returning to his residence in mid-afternoon
                            from the Embassy chancery in Saigon, two unidentified men on a motor
                            bicycle threw a hand grenade at his automobile. The grenade hit the
                            automobile, but did not explode. The assailants escaped. In telegram 34
                            from Saigon later that day, <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> briefly described what had happened. Expressing
                            the hope that “no special notice” would be taken of the incident,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> said <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0226"/>that the Embassy would continue
                            business as usual. (Department of State, Central Files, 123-<persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Frederick E.</persName>)</p>
                        <p>To prevent unnecessary anxiety on the part of American residents in
                            Saigon, <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> issued a notice
                            on July 11 urging that they also continue business as usual but that
                            they conduct themselves prudently in the near future. A copy of the
                            notice was sent to the Department of State as an enclosure to despatch
                            27 from Saigon, July 13, which provided further details on the July 8
                            incident and concluded that the evidence suggested that the attack “was
                            not part of a campaign of terror directed against Americans but was more
                            probably an isolated incident instigated by overzealous but unskilled
                            Viet Cong cadres.” (Ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On July 31, <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> wrote to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSJ1">Cottrell</persName> about the safety of
                            Americans in Viet-Nam and enclosed reports of rumored Viet Cong
                            terrorist activities in the Saigon area. <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> stated that he was not requesting any specific
                            protective actions but was merely letting <persName corresp="#p_CSJ1">Cottrell</persName> know “how things look to me in connection with
                            the security of Americans, and to send you some of the confusing reports
                            with which we are daily confronted.” The Ambassador concluded: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“What it all adds up to in my judgment-and, I think it is fair to
                                    say, in that of our Security Watch Committee-is a scare campaign
                                    on the part of our adversary to weaken and if possible destroy
                                    U.S. influence and action in this country. To the threats, the
                                    Communists add from time to time an action or two, to lend
                                    credence to the threats. What, if anything more, they can or
                                    will do remains to be seen. We here are unanimous on the
                                    proposition that we will not be bluffed, or terrorized, out of
                                    the necessary work to be done here.</p>
                                <p>“The safety of American dependents weighs heavily on my mind, as
                                    you can well understand. In the light of all evidence available
                                    to me, I see no reason for changing our present policy with
                                    respect to dependents, which is that they should be permitted to
                                    come to this post, subject to a full briefing of the officer
                                    concerned on the conditions here, after which he should make his
                                    own decision. If directly asked, I should myself say that I see
                                    no compelling reason not to bring dependents.” (Ibid., Viet-Nam

                                <item>As I see it, the purpose of raising the Viet-Nam issue as a
                                    case of aggression is either to induce effective international
                                    action or to free our hands and our consciences for whatever we
                                    have to do. The optimum goal is to create a more persuasive
                                    deterrent position with respect to the Laos conference and
                                    VietNam. At the minimum we put ourselves in a political position
                                    to salvage South Laos and save Viet-Nam with a more rational
                                    military plan than we now have.</item>

                                <item>I would underline this. I do not believe that raising the
                                    issue requires that we be immediately prepared, if we do not
                                    succeed, to go for Hanoi; it merely clears the ground for direct
                                    action and, in so doing, creates more effective support for
                                    whatever negotiations we may have in Southeast Asia.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Behind all this is a view, which I believe <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> shares, that we
                                    are unlikely to be able to negotiate anything like a
                                    satisfactory Laos settlement unless the other side believes that
                                    we are prepared, as an alternative to a satisfactory settlement,
                                    to fight. My anxiety has been that our present military plan,
                                    focussed on the <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0229"/>Mekong
                                    Valley (which I assume the other side knows), might not be an
                                    effective and persuasive deterrent. I would assume that a
                                    posture aimed more directly against North Viet-Nam is more
                                    likely to be diplomatically persuasive.</item>

                                    the Laos and Viet-Nam problems together; their relation to

                        <p>Question: Are reforms in military command really taking hold or are they
                            mere paper devices to cover Diem’s continued personal detailed
                            management?</p>
                        <p>Answer: A review of the recent accomplishments by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the military field as the result of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> continued and intensive urging
                            over a period of many months convinces me that real progress is being
                            made in this vital field. These reforms, starting with the Transfer of
                            the Civil Guard to the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> in the fall
                            of 1960, and in particular, the recent command and territorial
                            reorganization of military and pare-military forces, as recommended by
                            the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d1">Document 1</ref>.</note> have resulted in
                            significant changes in the basic structure of the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> military establishment. These important and far reaching
                            command reforms so long recommended are designed and, under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> guidance and supervision in the
                            implementation phase, are progressing towards the desired goal of a
                            clear, sound chain of military command which encourages initiative and
                            the assumption of responsibility at all levels. As a result of
                            representations by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> during the
                            recent Vinh Binh operations, the President has reversed the <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0230"/>previous assignment to Province Chiefs,
                            of certain <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units in this area.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, the military reorganization of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> includes the operational activation
                            of the Field Command as the responsible military tactical operations
                            agency for all of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>, the territorial
                            redivision of the country and assignment of responsibility to the three
                            Corps, and the establishment of Logistic Commands to replace Military
                            Regions. These are all major accomplishments, carried out during a
                            period of increased Viet Cong activity, with a high degree of urgency
                            and efficiency. Troop units have been physically moved with the minimum
                            of disruption of daily operations. And two large control headquarters,
                            Headquarters Field Command and III Corps, which until the reorganization
                            were largely “paper organizations,” have assumed actual operational
                            control while still organizing and receiving their communications
                            equipment. The vital logistics reorganization is taking shape as
                            recommended and the Log Commands daily assume more of their full
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>This logical command and territorial organization continues down from
                            Corps to Division Sectors with the clear assignment of responsibility
                            and the troops to do the job. For large scale operations the division
                            commander will exercise command and use his own chain of command. For
                            small operations the Province Chief (subsector commander) will exercise
                            control under the supervision of the Division Commander. It should, of
                            course, be recognized that fully effective implementation of all the
                            military command recommendations will take considerable time and that it
                            is complicated by the continuing heavy commitment of military and
                            pare-military units to counter-insurgency missions. A time lag in
                            accomplishing a reorganization of this magnitude can be expected even in
                            more advanced armies than that of Vietnam-over which we have advisory
                            control only.</p>
                        <p>Military reorganization and realignment of functions has not been
                            restricted to the field units. Plans for major decentralization from
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to the Joint Staff continue to
                            be refined. The Joint Staff is devoting increased attention to policy
                            matters of a broader nature since it relinquished operational control of
                            combat units to Field Command. These actions also take time, but I am
                            impressed by the progress already made.</p>
                        <p>Question: How successful was the recent delta sweep?</p>
                        <p>Answer: From a purely military point of view the operation was considered
                            a success. There were four primary objectives: <list>

                        <p>Although this operation disclosed certain deficiencies in coordination
                            and detailed planning, as was to be expected in the initial operation
                            under a new command arrangement, it did represent a major step forward
                            in carrying out the military command and operational principles
                            recommended in the <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>. The chain of
                            command was clear cut from Field Command through the III Corps Commander
                            and the 21st Division Commander to the Combat Units. The joint
                            preplanning, although held closely for security reasons, was very good.
                            Although because of this, implementation of the plan needed improvement.
                            The Province Chief did not interfere with the military aspects of the
                            operation and, in fact, assisted in every way possible. All elements of
                            the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> involved in this operation,
                            and particularly the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>, Field Command
                            and III Corps, will benefit greatly from the lessons learned.</p>
                        <p>The objective of “showing the flag” to offset <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> propaganda was clearly accomplished. The <gloss target="#t_PsyWar1">PsyWar</gloss> Companies’ actions were closely
                            coordinated with the operation throughout and were quite effective.
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces were seen in force
                            throughout the area. Now that major operational forces have been
                            withdrawn it will depend on the civil administration, supported as
                            necessary by local military and/or pare-military forces, to maintain
                            security. Currently, one <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalion
                            and two ranger companies remain in the area to ensure take-over and
                            orderly control by security forces under the civil administration
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>A large quantity of equipment and supplies was captured and/ or destroyed
                            to include weapons, boats, kerosene, food caches, and other
                            miscellaneous <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> equipment. In addition,
                            a dispensary, a training center, a crude small arms factory, and a
                            supply center were overrun and captured. 26 <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were killed, 37 captured, and another 37 suspects taken
                            into custody. While these figures may not seem impressive at first
                            glance, and undoubtedly some <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as
                            individuals eluded military forces by water, it is the nature of
                            counter-guerrilla warfare that identification and elimination of
                            guerrillas is a long, gruelling and costly process. It is not one that
                            lends itself to sudden and spectacular success. In view of the very
                            large area covered by one division of five battalion equivalents, these
                            results are good.</p>
                        <p>Question: Will it be followed up by further sweeps of the same area as
                            means of establishing real sterilization?</p>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0232"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> This operation was not the traditional
                            French type “sweep”. It was a joint operation by Air-Navy-Ground Forces
                            which was coordinated with Provinces on either side of Vinh Binh. There
                            are no known plans at this time for further operations of this nature in
                            same area. However, General <persName corresp="#p_NKBG1">Khanh</persName>, Chief of Staff, has assured me they intend to
                            ensure take-over and control by the civil and security forces before
                            complete <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> pull out. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> concept for sterilization of an area
                            as contained in the Proposed Counter-Insurgency Plan for Viet-Nam
                            visualizes military operations being phased out of an area by the
                            gradual but integrated take-over by security forces and civilian
                            control. Permanent pacification or sterilization can never be
                            accomplished by military sweeps or even more valid military action
                            alone. In this operation, there was insufficient civil-military
                            preplanning for application at the outset of the concomitant political,
                            social, economic and psychological measures required to assure permanent
                            pacification. Even when present operations in Vinh Binh are
                            accomplished, large scale military operations by regular forces will
                            again be required if other measures prove inadequate in the face of
                            renewed, determined <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> activities. This
                            remains to be seen.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> Is this an example of improved military
                            coordination, planning, and strategy, or does it represent a flashy
                            operation without real permanent improvement in these areas?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> does not agree with the
                            implication that <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> puts on
                            “flashy” operations. This force is too heavily committed to allow for
                            such tactics. We are strongly of the opinion that a genuine improvement
                            in coordination, planning and strategy is in the making as indicated by
                            this and other recent operations. The recent reorganization of the chain
                            of command and subsequent clarification of implementing directives has
                            every chance of significantly improving military operations. Valuable
                            lessons were learned from this operation which have already been pointed
                            out by Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to senior military
                            authorities who are now working on improvements. However, the worth of
                            the entire military operation in Viet-Nam cannot and should not properly
                            be evaluated on one single operation. If properly applied, they will
                            materially improve subsequent operations. Particularly encouraging is
                            the evidence of renewed offensive spirit and motivation on the part of
                            the military who took part in the planning and execution of this
                            operation. From personal observations, I can assure you that enthusiasm,
                            determination and seriousness of purpose on the part of military
                            personnel at all levels was clearly evident.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> Is there any effective central planning
                            done by any agency other than Diem himself?</p>
                        <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0233"/>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> In the military field: Yes. For example,
                            as previously reported, planning and execution by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>
                            and lower levels in implementation of <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> recommendations for reorganization, and repositioning
                            of forces and as indicated in the recent Vinh Binh operation. Of course,
                            there will continue to be room for improvement. For example, the
                            Military Assistant to the Director of the Cabinet is developing a policy
                            paper on National Objectives in hopes of obtaining its approval as a
                            basis for further national military planning. At his request, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is currently reviewing the study.
                            Also, the J-1 of the <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> has recently
                            completed a study on further increases in <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, copies of which have been provided <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. It is generally in consonance with
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Requisite Force Structure
                            Study, except that it contemplates a slower rate of build up. As you
                            know, Field Command conceived the recent military operation in Vinh Binh
                            Province and planned it in conjunction with III Corps Headquarters. III
                            Corps and 21st Division Headquarters carried it out with little or no
                            interference from above. Again, a combined Vietnamese-US military
                            committee is preparing field manuals on counter-insurgency operations
                            using the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Tactics and Techniques
                            Study as one of their sources.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> Is real progress discernible as result
                            of recent U.S. moves or is progress expected or is it business as
                            usual?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> In the military field, real progress has
                            been made and there is every reason to hope that progress will continue.
                            There is no doubt that military leaders at the national level are
                            working long hours in a sincere effort to improve Vietnam’s security
                            situation. Their attitude is definitely not one of “business as usual,”
                            in the connotation of this question.</p>
                        <p>Command reorganization and the resultant establishment of a proper chain
                            of command discussed earlier are, of course, only the long needed basis
                            from which real operational changes begin. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> feels it unfortunate that this basis for improvement
                            was deferred until the agreements on the overall <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> were reached. I feel that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has made considerable progress in training and in the
                            operational field. A concept of employment for Civil Guard units has
                            been developed which serves as the basis for all <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> training. This program includes special leadership as
                            well as individual and unit training, all oriented toward anti-guerrilla
                            combat. Ranger training has continued to receive high priority and
                            emphasis as has ranger type training for all combat units of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In the field of operations, progress has been made in the cooperation
                            between Air and Ground units. This cooperation involving quick reaction
                            times for air support is of extreme importance and in pertinent
                            operations this year has had good success. Concepts have been developed
                            for use of specially training forces using <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0234"/>helicopters and necessary training implementation is
                            under way. Permission for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors
                            to assist <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> units in operations
                            down to battalion and separate company size units has begun to produce
                            some tangible results. Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has
                            requested that the President give his support to ensuring further
                            implementation by Commanders in this area. We are, of course, pushing
                            for much needed improvement in both the training and operations areas.
                            Although <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> holds the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> to U.S. standards, it should be
                            realistically recognized that these will not be attained
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>After considerable delay due to circumstances beyond <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> control, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is now
                            moving ahead with its increase to a strength of 170,000. Current plans
                            contemplate all units to be activated by December. Although activation
                            of certain elements of the 20,000 increase has taken place,
                            unfortunately, it has not progressed to the point for which the increase
                            was justified, of permitting rotation of major units for badly needed
                            rest, rehabilitation, and unit training.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I feel the time for changes of this magnitude, especially
                            under the pressures of a daily hot war, must be recognized. While I am
                            far from satisfied or complacent, and fully recognize the urgency and
                            need for continued improvement, I am not pessimistic but rather I am
                            impressed by the concrete accomplishments made by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in the military command and operations
                            fields. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> have not implemented all of our
                            military recommendations, nor have they fully completed certain of the
                            projects initiated; however, I feel they are making progress as fast as
                            could reasonably be expected.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The result of this briefing has been to
                            clear the air considerably on the problem of exchange rate and to
                            stimulate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> thinking, including
                            Diem’s, on the necessity to assure higher piastre yield on American aid
                            dollar. Vietnamese, in general discussion, seemed anxious set target for
                            higher amounts commercial aid, perhaps as hedge against expected fall in
                            export receipts. National Assembly, however, has just acted to increase
                            production taxes by 20 per cent which will increase budget yield on
                            American aid dollar to nearly 60 piastres although amounts deposited
                            counterpart including customs will remain at present level of about 43
                            piastres to dollar.</p>
                        <p>It is opportune that <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> representatives
                            are now holding annual consultations with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> overlapping <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> and
                            their influence will undoubtedly be directed toward unification of
                            piastre dollar exchange at rate of 73.50 or higher.</p>
                        <p>Task Force recognizes, however, that we have an emergency situation here,
                            that momentum and confidence must be preserved and that in negotiations
                            we should estimate liberally the amount of commercial aid that can
                            usefully come in under the principles set forth in the joint study.
                            Believe our theme should be, not that we want to set arbitrary limits on
                            US aid, but that we want to help get the job done in manner and under
                            arrangements conducive to sound economic growth and sound financial
                            management in Vietnam. We also think that negotiations here on
                            government-to-government level should be undertaken promptly in light of
                            imaginative and persuasive <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss>

                        <p>You ask: What are the implications of the situation in Southeast Asia for
                            the handling of the Berlin crisis?</p>

                                    military build-up should take account of a Southeast Asia crisis
                                    as well as a Berlin crisis. The state of East Germany makes me
                                    somewhat skeptical that Mr. K. will push Berlin too far this
                                    year; although he may go as far as the treaty. Moreover, the
                                    possibility of a Southeast Asia crisis means we should delay
                                    until relatively late in the game the actual commitment of
                                    forces to Europe.</item>

                                <item><p><hi rend="italic">Public Presentation</hi>. The military
                                        moves you take should be presented to our people, our
                                        allies, and the other side as justified not by Berlin but by
                                        a general heightening of danger in the world environment. We
                                        do not know whether access to Berlin will be cut; we do not
                                        know whether the offensive in Laos will be resumed. We do
                                        not know what scale of action the Viet-minh might mount in
                                        South Viet-nam; we do not know what lies behind K’s threats
                                        to Iran; we do not know what mischief Castro plans in Latin

                                    <p>Legally, there would be great advantage in presenting your
                                        proposals as a modification of existing emergency
                                        arrangements. We have lived since 1945-or at least June
                                        1950-under emergency conditions. Your action should simply
                                        record your conviction that-in degree-the dangers have
                                        increased, and prudence calls for a stronger contingency
                                        position across the board.</p>
                                    <p>At home, this line of approach would strengthen your hand in
                                        holding the line on foreign aid, space, and education.
                                        Increased insurance outlays do not justify breaking up a
                                        family’s long-range planning, especially when the increased
                                        insurance is small in relation to the family’s income and
                                        income is rising rapidly.</p>
                                    <p>This approach would avoid charges among certain elements in
                                        Europe that the U.S. is excessively excited and aggressive
                                        about Berlin.</p>

                                    as well, we can expect them to try to exploit our concentration

                                    Berlin does not mean that we are unmindful of Asia.

                        <p>In the two months that I have been here I have traveled widely in
                            country, generally in company President Diem and several of his cabinet.
                            Have also spent many hours in private conversation with Diem, whom I
                            like and admire as a person. The trips have been worthwhile, I think,
                            despite fact that much of what I saw was dressed up for President’s
                            visit. (I feel certain that Department [Diem?] would prefer to see
                            things in the raw, and was not trying particularly to impress me; but a
                            certain amount of artificiality is nevertheless built into such visits.)
                            Trips have extended to all areas of Vietnam, including about 100
                            kilometers of Laotian border, except far north, which I hope to visit
                            soon. They have provided opportunity to compare conditions and attitudes
                            other sections of country with those in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Distinction should be made, I think, between two aspects of situation
                            here, often confused: (A) What is Vietnamese Government (which means
                            President Diem) striving for? Are his philosophy, objectives, and moral
                            values sound in terms US interests in world? (B) How are these being put
                            into effect? How are they being understood and received by Vietnamese
                            people? Is progress rapid enough to keep pace with increased pressure?
                            If not, what can be done about it?</p>
                        <p>Regarding (A), I think President Diem’s philosophy of government, and his
                            objectives for his country, are sound and good. After many hours of
                            fundamental discussions, I am convinced that he is no dictator, in the
                            sense of relishing power for its own sake. On the contrary, he seems to
                            me to be a man dedicated to high principles by himself and his people; a
                            man who would prefer to be a monk rather than a political leader; a man
                            who does not fundamentally enjoy power or the exercise of it. He is,
                            nevertheless, an egoist in the sense that he believes (in my judgment,
                            with some justification) that he can govern in South Vietnam, in general
                            and in detail, better than anyone else now available; and that he knows
                            more about the Communist movement in this area and how to combat it than
                            anyone else. His own strong convictions, energy, and his faith in
                            himself are both a strength and a weakness-a strength in providing <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0240"/>a counter-dynamic to communism,
                            a weakness in causing over-concentration of governmental power and
                            authority, consequent lack of governmental efficiency, and in offering a
                            vulnerable political target. His philosophy of government, summed up in
                            the term “personalism” (which does not mean personal dictatorship but
                            rather the requirement for individual development much in the
                            Aristotelian sense) is perhaps too lofty for popular understanding, but
                            is certainly in my judgment sound and right, and compatible with US
                            interests. (Please note July 7 expression of this philosophy sent Task
                            Force Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d92fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note>) Thus, I think the United States should have no
                            hesitation on moral grounds in backing Diem to the hilt. Where we think
                            he is wrong, we can bring about ameliorations and improvements gradually
                            in proportion to the confidence which he has in us and in his ability to
                            make concessions without slipping.</p>
                        <p>Re (B), my (Limit Distribution) assessment is less clear-cut. There is no
                            question that Diem and his government have felt an increasing upsurge of
                            confidence in the US over the past 6 months, despite developments in
                            Laos. High US expressions of support, backed by concrete and continuing
                            actions, have had real effect. First commandment of task force report-to
                            build confidence-was, in my judgment, soundly conceived, is being
                            carried out, and is being reciprocated. Strong and evident US support
                            has brought to the government side a certain number of fence-sitters,
                            and has also probably considerably reduced the likelihood of a military
                            coup d’etat. It has at the same time made Diem an even more vulnerable
                            target of Communist attack, which has, I fear, carried some people into
                            the enemy’s camp. Diem himself realizes this and that is why he is so
                            eager to get across the thought that victory of the Vietnamese people
                            over Communist subversion has title [?] gained through Vietnamese
                            sacrifice and not directly through American or free world protection.
                            Nevertheless, I do not think it is true that US support has given
                            President Diem’s government as yet a net increase in popularity among
                            the Vietnamese people. Oddly enough, Diem’s own keen personal interest
                            in and knowledge of theoretical things of life, such as farming,
                            fishing, disease, teaching methods, construction methods and techniques,
                            are misinterpreted or distorted by many Vietnamese into the picture of a
                            remote and aloof man who has little interest in the welfare of the
                            common man. This is due in part, I think, to his manner and in part to
                            Communist propaganda. It is definitely a false picture, judging from
                            many trips and much discussion. In any case, it seems to me clear that
                            in some way the Diem government must make a “break-through” to regain
                            popular support. If the situation drags on in an inconclusive manner for
                            many <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0241"/>more months, either a
                            military coup, or an open proclamation of a Communist Government and
                            widespread civil war, is likely.</p>
                        <p>I agree that the key to such a break-through is sufficient military and
                            security forces, and skillful selection thereof, to guarantee protection
                            and a free choice to the people in Vietnam, especially in the country
                            districts. At present, despite all efforts, this protection does not
                            exist in many areas. In fact, while accurate statistics on the degree of
                            security are not obtainable, and while the situation varies from
                            province-to-province and from district-to-district, I do not believe
                            that the net security situation is any better now than it was 2 months
                            ago. There have been some encouraging statistics, such as the percentage
                            of actions being initiated by government forces against Viet Cong<note n="4" xml:id="d92fn4">Omission in the source text.</note> forces
                            against 75 percent initiated by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> four
                            months ago), which in turn seems to reflect more intelligence coming in
                            from countryside. (This ratio has recently slipped again.) On the other
                            hand, there are reports of very large losses of rice to Viet Cong (being
                            checked and reported separately), instances of refusal from fear to
                            identify assassins, and the establishment of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> “governments” parallel to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> authority in some areas, collecting taxes and issuing
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> money. All of which adds up to a
                            very mauve picture, but one which is certainly not conclusively getting
                            better. In our attempt to help create a new and winning psychology, I
                            have taken a much more optimistic line in conversations with other
                            diplomats and with press here than that reflected above, and I think we
                            should continue to do so, giving benefit of the doubt wherever possible
                            to optimistic assessment.</p>
                        <p>Re security situation Saigon itself, there is no evident change over past
                            several months, aside from shooting up of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> officer Davis’s car about ten miles out of Saigon a
                            week ago, and grenade attempt at me last Saturday. We have been trying
                            to figure out what these mean in terms of security of Americans here,
                            but cannot be categoric. Facts are that no arrests made to date in
                            either incident. There was reluctance on the part of eye witnesses to
                            Davis’ shooting to testify or identify assailant. Vietnamese police and
                            surete are conscientiously working on cases, but no concrete results to
                            date. After a study, we have gotten out a note to Americans here, based
                            on conclusion that recent attacks do not seem to foreshadow wider
                            terrorist activities against Americans, but recommending increased
                            prudence and circumspection.</p>

                            that most of Viet-Cong escaped net, and that while much territory was
                            liberated, there is question as to who will control it after bulk of
                            forces withdrawn. Some Ranger battalions are being left there, and some
                            civic action being undertaken by army units. In general, however, it
                            appears that this sweep points up the long-felt need of utmost
                            coordination between military actions and quick follow-up on social and
                            economic programs. We have not licked this problem yet.</p>
                        <p>Re <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reforms in military command,
                            intelligence, economic and social fields, the following is a quick
                            personal assessment.</p>
                        <p>Military command: Despite some reports to contrary, my evaluation is that
                            reform in military command is producing many desired results, and will
                            produce more. Diem’s proclivity to interfere with military authority
                            will be further reduced as his own confidence in US support and in
                            loyalty his military forces increases. Confidence on both fronts is
                            increasing.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence: While <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> central
                            intelligence organization not yet fully functioning, prospects are good
                            and we expect increasing results.</p>

                            July 11th,<note n="6" xml:id="d92fn6">See <ref target="#d90">Document
                                    90</ref>.</note> has opened new prospect and given real boost to
                            possibilities in these fields. This, added to continued effective work
                            of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss>, plus greater emphasis on part <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as reflected in recent Cabinet shifts, hold prospects
                            of increasing success. Much depends on US backing and particularly on
                            greater flexibility and promptness to follow-through.</p>
                        <p>Re effective central planning, we have come up with a recommendation,
                            embodied in joint briefing July 11 and accepted by Diem, of a mechanism
                            which promises to produce more effective planning and implementation of
                            joint programs. We must assure that these programs bear the stamp “Made
                            in VietNam” rather than “Made in America”, and we must keep constantly
                            on alert lest oral or written undertakings by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> substitute for concrete end products-something which
                            can happen here.</p>
                        <p>In general, I am optimistic. I believe we taking the right track. It is a
                            question of how fast and effectively we can advance.</p>

                        <p>Viet Nam is today under attack in a bitter, total struggle which involves
                            its survival as a free nation. Its enemy, the Viet Cong, is ruthless,
                            resourceful, and elusive. This enemy is supplied, reinforced, and
                            centrally directed by the international Communist apparatus operating
                            through Hanoi. To defeat it requires the mobilization of the entire
                            economic, military, psychological, and social resources of the country
                            and vigorous support from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The long-term economic future of Viet Nam is bright. In fact, the
                            promising start already made toward improvement in the living conditions
                            of its people appears to be one of the factors which precipitated the
                            recent intensification of Communist pressure. The contrast between the
                            achievements of recent years in South Viet Nam and the hardships and
                            failure in Communist North Viet Nam was becoming too glaring. Given the
                            means to throw back the Communist attack and to resume its march of
                            economic, social, and political progress, Viet Nam can be an example in
                            Southeast Asia for the progressive potentialities of men who are
                            determined to remain free. We strongly urge that our two governments
                            make this the purpose of their continued cooperation.</p>
                        <p>At the moment, however, the primary problem is the restoration of
                            internal security in the face of tough, widespread, externally aided
                            Communist guerrilla warfare and subversion. To meet this problem
                            requires stepped-up military and policing action. But the problem is
                            more than a military problem. Its solution also demands stepped-up
                            economic and social action, especially in rural areas, closely
                            integrated <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0244"/>with the military
                            action. For example, one of the more promising counter-guerrilla methods
                            tried up to this time involves regrouping scattered rural populations
                            into more readily defensible communities so designed and assisted as
                            also to offer improved opportunities for livelihood.</p>
                        <p>Recognizing this close interdependence of the military and the
                            economic-social problems, we have based our recommendations on the
                            following three central considerations: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The military-internal security requirements must for the time
                                    being have first call on Viet Nam’s manpower and economic
                                    resources and on U.S. assistance. This is a short-term but
                                    essential requirement.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>At the same time, the degree to which the military-internal
                                    security operations achieve lasting success will, in large
                                    measure, depend on the speed and effectiveness with which the
                                    recommended emergency economic and social programs are
                                    applied.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The ultimate objective of these economic and social programs
                                    and of the longer-range development planning which we also
                                    recommend is to hasten the day when Viet Nam will be a
                                    self-sustaining economy and a peaceful, free society. This is
                                    desired by the Vietnamese, who want to be independent in the
                                    fullest sense, and by the Americans, who conceive their aid as
                                    helping people to help themselves toward a condition where they
                                    can continue to progress by their own efforts.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The recommendations which our two groups, working jointly together, have
                            thus prepared call for major increases in the level of effort of both
                            Viet Nam and the United States.</p>
                        <p>These increases reflect our sincere conviction that the subversive,
                            intensive warfare being waged today in South Viet Nam can be brought to
                            a successful conclusion only by the prompt application of effective
                            military power, coupled with large-scale economic and social action
                            reaching every part of the country, especially the rural areas. From the
                            financial standpoint, we believe it far less costly to provide fully
                            adequate resources today than to attempt to match Communist initiatives
                            with just enough strength to meet each new threat. The first course
                            offers a real possibility of early victory and thus an end to the tragic
                            waste of human life and of the material assets so sorely needed for the
                            economic development of the country. The second, while less costly in
                            terms of current budgets, will not provide sufficient resources to
                            achieve a decisive defeat of the Viet Cong organization and therefore
                            will, in the long run, prove more expensive as the war drags on with
                            increased intensity year after year.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the intensified program which we recommend our two countries
                            adopt as a basis for mutual actions over the next several years is
                            designed not just to hold the line but to achieve a <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0245"/>real breakthrough. Our joint efforts
                            must surpass the critical threshold of the enemy’s resistance, thereby
                            putting an end to his destructive attacks, and at the same time we must
                            make a decisive impact on the economic, social, and ideological
                            front.</p>

                                has requested an increase of his Army to 270,000 from the presently
                                approved ceiling of 170,000. To respond to this request it is first
                                necessary to determine the missions which have been or may be
                                assigned to this force. They are considered to fall under the
                                following headings: <list>
                                    <label>a.</label>

                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The forces for the first two missions, a and b, can be estimated
                                fairly readily (although a may change if c is not carried out), but
                                those for the third will depend on the over-all strategy to be
                                followed and the help obtainable from Thai, Laotian and U.S.
                                sources. If the defense against further infiltration is static along
                                the <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0246"/>frontiers of South
                                Vietnam, one set of forces is required. If an offensive solution is
                                sought involving a movement of Vietnamese forces into Laos against
                                the avenues of infiltration coupled perhaps with offensive air and
                                guerrilla action against enemy forces, a different set of forces
                                will be required. Thus, there is need of an over-all Southeast Asian
                                politico-military plan assigning missions to national forces,
                                establishing requirements in manpower, equipment and funds for each
                                country and making provision for the means to satisfy the
                                requirements.</item>

                            <item>To initiate the military portion of such a plan, I would suggest
                                asking the Joint Chiefs to produce an outline plan drawn on the
                                following bases: <list>

                                        <p>Under any set of circumstances growing out of the current
                                            Laos negotiations, it will be most important to secure
                                            and hold enough of the Mekong Valley and the Laotian
                                            panhandle to protect South Viet-Nam and Thailand from
                                            conventional attack or guerrilla penetration from North
                                            Laos and North Vietnam. In so doing it may become
                                            necessary or desirable to mount air attacks against
                                            targets in North Laos and North Vietnam, and to launch
                                            and support offensive guerrilla operations in these
                                            areas. Also during such operations, the United States
                                            should have a continuing capability to threaten and, if
                                            necessary, to carry out military operations from the sea
                                            against vital targets in North Vietnam.</p>

                                                i.e., (1) the securing of the Laotian panhandle and
                                                parts of the Mekong Valley, (2) the launching of
                                                offensive air and guerrilla operations from the
                                                panhandle, and (3) the application of military
                                                pressure against North Vietnam.</item>

                                            <item>To do the first two tasks, we should make maximum

                                                Laotian, South Vietnamese and Thai troops with the

                                                to the provision of logistical support. If further
                                                study indicates that indigenous forces are not
                                                sufficient or do not have the motivation to perform
                                                these two tasks, then we need to know the minimum
                                                U.S. forces necessary to stiffen the operation and
                                                assure its success. In this case, it would be hoped
                                                that the U.S. combat forces could be limited to air
                                                forces, to the ground forces necessary to provide
                                                immediate protection to U.S. air and supply bases,

                                                guerrilla and anti-guerrilla effort. Although, in

                            Vietnam. (<ref target="#d56">Document 56</ref>) In a conversation with

                            said, among other things, that he was very interested in the development
                            of a defoliant and would prefer one that permitted subsequent
                            agricultural growth. (Telegram <gloss target="#t_MAGCHCS1">MAGCH-CS</gloss> 921, June 16; Washington National Records Center,

                        <p>As a result of the visit, President Diem directed the Vietnamese Armed
                            Forces to establish a Combat Development and Test Center to be commanded
                            by a senior engineer officer, Colonel Trach, who was to report to him
                            through the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> concurred in the team’s
                            recommendation that a separate element be established within the
                            Military Assistance Advisory Group, a research and development office
                            composed initially of five people to form the United States component of
                            the joint operation. The team also developed a precept for the
                            establishment of the joint center which was approved by President Diem
                            and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>. Working
                            with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> representatives and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> authorities, the Godel team also
                            prepared an initial list of problems and proposed projects to be
                            considered by the center. In a memorandum of July 12 to Lansdale,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> reported on the
                            background and results of the team’s visit. Attached to the memorandum

                            results of his mission with the Viet-Nam Task Force. According to the

                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CSJ1">Cottrell</persName> introduced
                                    Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">William Godel</persName>, an
                                    expert from the Department of Defense on the techniques and
                                    practices of psychological warfare. Pursuant to Article 20 of
                                    the Presidential Program Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> and a team of experts went to Saigon and
                                    established, in <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0251"/>conjunction with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, a
                                    combat development test center to experiment with new techniques
                                    and weapons for the guerrilla war that is being fought in
                                    VietNam. The Vietnamese responded to the idea of a development
                                    test center with enthusiasm: Diem conducted no less than three
                                    personal interviews with <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> and assigned Colonel Trach to command it.
                                    Trach was placed directly under the supervision of the
                                    President. Among the new equipment introduced by Godel are: a
                                    power glider, a light highly-maneuverable aircraft which can fly
                                    for long periods on one tank of gasoline (an airborne
                                    Volkswagen), a paddle wheel boat with a steam engine burning
                                    cane alcohol which could operate in 3 inches of water, carrying
                                    20 to 30 men, an armolite rifle, something the short, small
                                    Vietnamese can fire without bowling themselves over. This is a
                                    22 caliber, commercially produced weapon with a high propellant
                                    charge. It could be used to great effect. It might be possible
                                    to issue this weapon to a ranger battalion and test it
                                    thoroughly under battle conditions. Dogs, trained to work with
                                    patrols, could introduce some mobility into the largely static
                                    patrol operations of the Vietnamese Army when night falls. Mr.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> also explored
                                    many new techniques. Among them is a quiet, tiny, effective
                                    village alarm system that could alert the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> at a distance of 25 miles
                                    without giving away the identity of the village informer. This
                                    alarm system is being developed simultaneously with a similar
                                    project by <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> is developing a bulky piece of
                                    equipment, which could hardly be hidden and could be immediately
                                    spotted by the alert Viet Cong. Another experiment concerns a
                                    defoliant to denude border infiltration areas. This is a costly
                                    operation which would require some three years for maximum
                                    effectiveness. Godel spoke of a hormone plant killer to
                                    eradicate the manioc crop on which the Viet Cong subsist while
                                    operating in the northern mountain regions. <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> analyzed the problem of
                                    bringing medical aid to the villages and affirmed that this
                                    operation should be part of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>’s civic action program. Uniformed medical
                                    orderlies, corpsmen or aides could best perform this difficult
                                    task as they could protect themselves from the Viet Cong while
                                    public health teams, Americans or Vietnamese could not. The
                                    ‘flying doctor’ technique whereby sick villagers are flown to
                                    hospitals in the major urban centers could also help to
                                    ameliorate the problem. <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> also spoke of the problem in the areas
                                    where Montagnards, mountain people, live. These people resent
                                    the pretensions of the Vietnamese to govern them and administer
                                    their needs, what they would desire is a degree of autonomy
                                    within the Vietnamese state.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> concluded that the
                                    program had begun well by showing the Vietnamese what kinds of
                                    weapons they need to fight their peculiar kind of war. The
                                    program will have, in time, a significant impact. <persName corresp="#p_GWH1">Godel</persName> stressed that the
                                    procurement problem must be met by more expeditious handling of
                                    requests within the Defense Department for these special items
                                    of equipment.” (Department of State, Viet-Nam Working Group

                            <item><p>The Staley group has completed their report. They took a few
                                    trips to get a more precise idea of the Vietnamese context. On
                                    the spot they did realize the difficulties and they did see that
                                    we are working and fighting hard. Three major things have to be
                                    implemented right away: increasing the force level, building up
                                    a wireless system for all villages, and expanding as much as we
                                    can the agrovilles network. I get the impression that the
                                    Ambassador agrees with me. He took quite a few trips with
                                    President Diem and myself. He gets convinced now, I think, that
                                    we must have more troops to occupy different areas, to protect
                                    population and we have too to regroup them. If you don’t occupy
                                    villages, the Commies get in and the population can’t
                                    resist.</p>
                                <p>The village level is the basis. Silver will report to you longer
                                    about the trip we took yesterday in Kien Hoa Province. That’s a
                                    successful test. The necessity is to act rapidly to create an
                                    impact right away. Better to increase noticeably the Armed
                                    Forces now to get rid of subversion in one or two years and to
                                    increase them afterwards than to take half measures. So, if
                                    Cottrell and yourself can get the force level of 200.000
                                    approved for 1962 and the corresponding level of commercialised
                                    (sic) aid, i.e., 170 millions US$, that would help a lot.</p>

                                Objectively that’s quite a hit. They lost 187 men and 10 prisoners.
                                Weapons captured: 76. As far as I remember, nothing like that

                                have to be overcome. The crucial long-term need for such an

                            despite some optimism, is basically disturbing. While it may simply be
                            too early to tell, we do not yet have things turned around in Vietnam.
                            In part this reflects one of the real problems for any government-how to
                            get adequate follow-through. We whack up a big exercise on a crash
                            problem, take some strong initiatives, and then the agencies tend to
                            slip back toward business as usual with only the White House providing
                            much of a prod.</p>
                        <p>But more important, there are some strong political reasons for stepping
                            up the momentum in South Vietnam. I believe it very important that this
                            government have a major anti-Communist victory to its credit in the six
                            months before the Berlin crisis is likely to get really hot. Few things
                            would be better calculated to show <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0257"/>Moscow and Peiping that we mean business than an
                            obvious (if not yet definitive) turnaround in Vietnam. Moreover, here
                            the odds are still in our favor, which makes Viet-Nam a better place
                            than Laos to achieve the desired result.</p>
                        <p>Such a victory is also indispensable to the process of reassuring our Far
                            East allies, most of whom have been led by Laos to wonder whether we
                            have the moxie to protect them any longer.</p>
                        <p>What should we do? How about the President directing that all wraps are
                            off in the counter-guerrilla operations, etc. in South Vietnam? We will
                            fund and pay for any crash measures, however wasteful, which will
                            produce quick results. We will do anything needed in sending arms and
                            ammunition, providing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisers,
                            and in associated social and economic operations designed to win back
                            the country side. The objective-to achieve before the end of the year a
                            major defeat of the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>The important thing would be a change in operational philosophy. Instead
                            of haggling with Diem over who should finance what proportion of the
                            effort, we would regard this as a wartime situation in which the sky s
                            fee limit. The only caveat would be that outlays must be related to the
                            counter-guerrilla campaign. Hence, we would not give Diem a blank check
                            on economic development or on building up the regular army for defense
                            of the 17th parallel as <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>
                            would have us do.</p>
                        <p>What would it cost? Even with a blank check, could we spend more than
                            $100 million or so extra in Viet-Nam over the next six months? Moreover,
                            if such a really crash effort were feasible, it would probably be a
                            sound investment in the long run. To let the counter-guerrilla
                            operations drag on over the years might well involve a far greater total
                            cost to us than that involved in moving fast now. Of course, the gut
                            question is feasibility; could South Viet-Nam absorb and utilize quickly
                            enough another great infusion of funds? Could we actually get more
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces into the field? At least
                            let’s look into it.</p>
                        <p>Simultaneously, we must put the blocks to Diem on finally doing the
                            necessary to regain popular support. Nolting concludes that he must
                            undertake such measures within the next few months or face the prospect
                            either of a military coup or a civil war. We must somehow impress Diem
                            with a sufficient sense of crisis to move faster than he is.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the above package would provide a lever for the President to
                            personally impress on Diem that (1) latter is being caught up in a
                            desperate crisis in which his very survival is at stake; (2) we are now
                            prepared to pull out all the stops in providing anything necessary to
                            meet this threat promptly and vigorously; but (3) the time has come when
                            he too must undertake the massive and <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0258"/>dynamic reform program without which the countryside
                            cannot be won.</p>
                        <p>What do we lose if such an initiative fails? Are we any worse off than
                            before? Our prestige may have become a little more heavily engaged but
                            what else? And the risk involved if we fail to prevent the Viet Cong
                            threat from developing into a full-fledged civil war is clearly
                            overriding. After Laos, and with Berlin on the horizon, we cannot afford
                            to go less than all-out in cleaning up South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>This is in response to your query about the 100,000-man increase
                            requested by the President of Viet-Nam for the Vietnamese Armed Forces.
                            The matter is under study in Defense now, at staff levels. Since it
                            hasn’t been before the Secretary or the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> for a determination, the most helpful thing to you
                            might be to see some of the staff considerations. After discussing this
                            with Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>,
                            I obtained some of the thinking in Defense on this subject and am
                            passing it along to you, informally, prior to a substantive Defense
                            position. The two staff officers most concerned with this subject are
                            Col. <persName corresp="#p_KCJR1">Kent</persName> in <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> and Col. <persName corresp="#p_LCRM1">Levy</persName> in the Joint Staff.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Force Levels</hi></p>
                        <p>Increases in Vietnam’s force levels have been discussed as being in three
                            phases. Based on an authorized level of 150,000, the phases were
                            increases of 20,000 (to 170,000), 30,000 (to 200,000), and concurrently
                            the 100,000 (adding to the 170,000 to make 270,000). The only approved
                            increase, to date, was the 20,000.</p>
                        <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>Although authorized strength of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> (Republic of Viet-Nam Armed Forces) was 150,000,
                            funds were never provided for this size force by either the U.S. or
                            Vietnam. So, the force level in fact was approximately 142,000. When the
                            20,000 increase was approved, the Vietnamese started building up their
                            force. They have now reached approximately 150,000. Inductions are at
                            the rate of about 4,000 per month, in addition to about 2,000 conscripts
                            and volunteers each month to offset normal attrition. It is estimated
                            that the 20,000 increase won’t be absorbed until December 1961.</p>
                        <p>The second phase, an increase of 30,000 (170,000 to 200,000) has received
                            careful consideration by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. Both agreed in principle that
                            the increase would probably be required but withheld outright approval
                            subject to continuing assessment of the situation in Vietnam, the
                            training of the 20,000 increase, including officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>’s and the use made of these additional
                            personnel. If the continued assessment indicates further increases up to
                            200,000 are required, the decision should be made in time to permit the
                            second phase to smoothly follow the first without interruption in the
                            induction of personnel. Estimates of the time required to field this
                            30,000 increase range from 8 to 18 months, due to the many
                            uncontrollable factors involved. It is likely that a year’s time will be
                            involved. During this period there will be ample time to assess the
                            requirement for a further additional increase of up to 70,000 making a
                            possible total of 270,000.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the actual problem of the increase from 200,000 to 270,000 will not
                            be ready for physical solution in Viet-Nam until about 18 months from
                            now. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has indicated that he
                            does not think there is the need or justification for such an increase
                            at this time. The feeling is that there are a number of months
                            available, during the build-up to 200,000, to make a continual
                            assessment of the capability of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> to obtain, train, and use officers and men. A timely
                            and justifiable decision could be made during this period as to the
                            necessity for and size of the increase</p>

                            and some of the U.S. staff in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>-Vietnam are looking for a “breakthrough” of the problem of
                            the current Viet Cong guerrilla threat by the proposed force increases.

                            sorely needed training. They look for sufficient troops to dominate the
                            enemy, liquidate him quickly, and to give a spirited lift to troop <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0260"/>morale and combat effectiveness

                        <p>Troops have been engaged extensively on operations in which months have
                            now been stretched into years of strain, fatigue, and casualties. Morale

                            have deep meaning, there has been an extended separation now of soldiers
                            from their families.</p>
                        <p>The “breakthrough” is seen as needed to give a sharp set-back to the
                            Communist threat, and to give Viet-Nam a fighting chance to get set for
                            future rounds with the enemy. The Republic of Viet-Nam will celebrate
                            the beginning of its seventh year of independence this Fall. It had 8
                            years of war during the Franco-Vietminh struggle after the fighting of
                            World War II, one year of intense civil strife (during 1954-55), and six
                            years of increasing guerrilla conflict as an independent nation. It is
                            badly in need of a breathing spell.</p>
                        <p>After the Geneva Accords of 1954, the Communists in North Viet-Nam
                            modernized and strengthened their armed forces to about 380,000, the
                            largest armed force in Southeast Asia. The threat posed by this force
                            has grown as areas of Laos have fallen to the skillfully combined Pathet
                            Lao-Vietminh forces, opening new routes of movement on the Laos-Vietnam
                            border along the western flank of Vietnam. While coping with the
                            internal problem of Viet Cong insurgency, this external threat cannot be
                            ignored; the Communists have given the external threat added meaning by
                            announcing that an enclave would be opened in South Viet-Nam for a
                            “Peoples Liberation” government, and have indicated this would be aided
                            by armed force across the border.</p>
                        <p>The territory of South Viet-Nam has about 66,000 square miles. About 20%
                            of this is dominated by the Viet Cong, and combat requirements for
                            liquidating the Viet Cong are high. Another 40% has Viet Cong activity,
                            ranging from small hit-and-run guerrilla bands hiding out in jungles and
                            mountains to small teams of subversive agents; in this area, combat
                            requirements are far less. The <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0261"/>exact combat requirements are not precisely clear, but certainly
                            appear to be beyond present capabilities. As the Civil Guard and the
                            Self-Defense forces are improved, as the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> forces are increased, the “breakthrough” might well
                            occur before the 270,000 level is reached.</p>
                        <p>One facet of the force increase problem is the availability of Officers
                            and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s. There is some shortage now.
                            The demand for high quality leadership will be sharpened as troop
                            strengths are increased. Training centers are reported to be crowded and
                            there are many problems growing out of the difficulty to provide
                            trainers without placing unacceptable demands on operational units.</p>
                        <p>The arithmetic of force increases has been based largely on divisions,
                            (with the division being “papa and mama” to its regiments, battalions,
                            and companies however they are detached for combat assignments). An
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> force of 270,000 is
                            essentially a 15 division force. It would permit 2 more divisions in the
                            Northern Corps area, 3 more in the Central Corps area, one more in the
                            South, and two in the General Reserve.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that four divisions are required to provide adequate delay
                            and the defense potential envisioned in the Hue-Danang (Tourane) area,
                            and to conduct effective counter-insurgency operations (reportedly 8,000
                            Montagnards are being trained in North Viet-Nam and Laos for guerrilla
                            operations in the High Plateau of South Vietnam, and there are records
                            of 700 infiltrators per month). The fall of Laos has placed Route #9 in
                            Communist hands, which flanks this area and gives the RVNF commander the
                            task of delaying from both North and West, and then conducting the
                            defense of Danang.</p>
                        <p>The High Plateau area is critical and the key terrain in the defense of
                            South Vietnam. This area is vulnerable to attack by forces from a Pathet
                            Lao controlled flanking position, in the Plateau de Bolovens of Laos on
                            the West and Northwest, by forces from the East and Northeast by-passing
                            Danang, and by infiltration. Enemy forces attaining control of the High
                            Plateau area are in a position to drive South to the final objective of
                            Saigon. Four divisions are believed required to secure this area against
                            overt or covert attack.</p>
                        <p>The East coastal plain, south of the Hue-Danang area, requires one
                            division to secure the Cam Ranh Bay and Nha Trang area against attack
                            from the North and West and to provide the nucleus for determined
                            defense in this area in case the High Plateau is lost. This division
                            should provide surveillance, protection of lines of communications,
                            conduct counter-insurgency operations and reinforce other areas as
                            required. It should be assigned to the Corps controlling units on the
                            High Plateau.</p>
                        <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0262"/>
                        <p>To conduct the defense and counterinsurgency operations in the
                            Saigon-Delta area requires four divisions. The General Reserve would
                            also initially be positioned in this area. A General Reserve of one
                            division plus the division-equivalent Airborne Brigade would also be
                            stationed initially in the Saigon area. Additional forces may be
                            available from other areas or from the General Reserve if any enemy
                            attack progressed to a degree of providing a major threat.</p>

                                South Viet-Nam and capable of providing a point of support for
                                operations in the North. Such a base can be secured only through the
                                cooperative action of Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, assisted and
                                encouraged by the United States.</item>

                                Following agreement as to the role which the military and

                                this base, the United States can then see more clearly the kind of
                                military aid programs which are necessary and appropriate in this
                                region. In other words, to answer the question of the future size of
                                the Vietnamese Army, we need a strategic plan for the entire

                            latter part of July 1961. Everything I saw during my fairly extensive
                            travels throughout the country and during conversations with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers in the field led me to

                        <p>The additional 30,000 troops are needed to create two additional infantry
                            divisions and minimum supporting air, naval and logistic units. These
                            forces will be employed primarily to meet the increased threat resulting
                            from the deteriorating situation in Laos. This includes the stepped-up
                            infiltration of Viet-Cong supplies and guerrilla forces across the
                            southern Laos border, as well as the very real threat of flanking
                            attacks from north Viet-Nam which might strike eastward across Route 9
                            toward Hue and into the Kontum-Pleiku area further to the south. It
                            should be remembered that as of July 1961 President Diem only had two
                            regiments in general reserve to protect his country in event of an overt
                            military attack. As indicated above, all the rest of his forces are
                            deployed on counter-insurgency actions.</p>

                                    Southeast Asia is precarious: Laos could be lost to Communist
                                    control; the Viet-Cong offensive could overwhelm South VietNam;
                                    Thailand could slide toward an ambiguous neutralism; Cambodia
                                    could despair of maintaining its neutrality. In the face of this

                        <p>Your Task Force on Southeast Asia is engaged in a preliminary review of
                            our policy for the Southeast Asia peninsula which includes Thailand,
                            VietNam, Laos and Cambodia. The object of our study is to devise a
                            course of action to arrest communist encroachment into that area. The
                            consensus, on a preliminary examination of the problem, brings us to the
                            following conclusions: <list>

                                    globally, to ensure the security of Southeast Asia against

                                    the form of political take-over or whether they intend to
                                    accomplish the task by covert or overt military means.</item>

                        <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>, who explained
                            that Southeast Asia, in the current context, meant Laos, Vietnam,
                            Thailand, and Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Summarizing the current situation, Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            remarked that the Communists show no sign of wanting a neutral Laos. Our
                            estimate is that they are very confident about the current military
                            situation and see no reason for concessions. Thus, the question for us
                            is whether we can introduce a new element which will change their
                            estimate of the situation. Without such a change, it is most unlikely
                            that there will be any agreement in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Our position is that two elements are required for a satisfactory Laotian
                            settlement: a strong <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and a
                            government which gives real promise of avoiding Communist domination.
                            Without these two conditions, Laos will pose an increasing threat to
                            South Vietnam. Our situation in that country is not improving. The
                            Vietnamese are killing members of the Viet-Cong in significant numbers,
                            but as these losses are inflicted, more are introduced, and we are on a
                            sort of treadmill there.</p>
                        <p>The question then is whether we can make a coordinated approach to the
                            problem of Southeast Asia. It is not easy, because Southeast Asia is an
                            American geographical expression rather than a political reality.
                            Thailand, Laos and Viet-Nam have complex relations one with another, and
                            while their present interests are much alike, there are rivalries and
                            differences which make cooperation difficult.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the political situation in Laos itself, Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> reported a lack of progress in
                            negotiations among the three Princes. His Washington visit has
                            apparently stiffened Phoumi’s back. (Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            thought the stiffening was about right, but the President later
                            expressed reservations.) Meanwhile, <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan 5 is ready if the cease-fire is broken, … .</p>
                        <p>The new element which is now being considered, in working discussions in
                            the U.S. Government, is the creation of a plan to take and hold the
                            southern part of Laos with combined forces of the Royal Laotian
                            Government, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States. The proposal is
                            that we would press in Geneva for a strong <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0275"/>making plain
                            that unless such an arrangement is established, the U.S. will not give
                            up its current position in Laos in support of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. At the same time, we would support
                            Phoumi in refusing to accept any government which would be likely to
                            slip under Communist control. If these conditions are not met, and if
                            the cease-fire is broken, we would then go, not for a re-establishment
                            of the status quo, but for a strong new position, as described, in
                            Southern Laos.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from the Secretary of State, Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> stated that his proposal did not
                            exclude a Laotian Government with some members of the Pathet Lao in it.
                            The point was, rather, how many, and in what Cabinet positions, and
                            later there was agreement to a suggestion from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJM1">Steeves</persName> that it is time now to begin
                            discussing particular names in particular posts. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> continued that whatever the Government,
                            the character and powers of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> are
                            of central importance.</p>
                        <p>It was further made clear that if we were unable to agree to proposals
                            made in Geneva and if we should support the Lao Government in a parallel
                            position, we would nevertheless continue to talk and would not ourselves
                            be the agents to break up the conference.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a paragraph on the internal political situation in
                            Laos.]</p>
                        <p>It was evident from this same gloomy view that the working party had
                            turned to a consideration of a new military alternative. One part of
                            this alternative plan, as explained above, is the notion of a capture of
                            Southern Laos. The second part, Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            explained, is the possibility of responding in a new way to any
                            substantial intervention by the Viet-minh. The force proposed for
                            Southern Laos would probably be able to cope with any Pathet Lao force
                            that might be placed against it. Previously it had been supposed that if
                            the Viet-minh should intervene, any additional action would have to be
                            located in Laos. Now there was discussion of the possibility of meeting
                            any such substantial intervention by the Vietminh with a direct air and
                            naval operation at Haiphong or Hanoi. And possibly you can deter any
                            such attack in Laos by making clear that there are circumstances in
                            which you would take this more energetic course. Questions from the
                            President showed that the detailed aspects of this military plan had not
                            been developed. It was not clear how great an effect action against
                            Haiphong or Hanoi would have on Northern Viet-nam, nor whether it would
                            be easy to hold what had been taken in a single attack. Similarly, no
                            careful plan has yet been developed for an operation to take and hold
                            Southern Laos. Planning is proceeding, and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> is in close touch with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>. But the President
                            made clear his own deep concern with the need for realism and accuracy
                            in such military <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0276"/>planning. He
                            had observed in earlier military plans with respect to Laos that
                            optimistic estimates were invariably proven false in the event. He was
                            not persuaded that the airfields and the existing situation in Southern
                            Laos would permit any real operation to save that part of the country,
                            and he emphasized the reluctance of the American people and of many
                            distinguished military leaders to see any direct involvement of U.S.
                            troops in that part of the world. In reply it was urged that with a
                            proper plan, with outside support, and above all with a clear and open
                            American commitment, the results would be very different from anything
                            that had happened before. But the President remarked that General de
                            Gaulle, out of painful French experience, had spoken with feeling of the
                            difficulty of fighting in this part of the world.</p>
                        <p>A relevant element in military planning of any sort is the financial
                            stringency which is pressing the British to reduce their military
                            commitments east of Suez. The current Cabinet order is that this
                            reduction be on the order of 35 million pounds a year. The British, in
                            any event, will be most reluctant to participate in any broader scheme
                            of the kind which is now under discussion.</p>
                        <p>Another related element is the problem of international opinion with
                            respect to the situation in Viet-nam. It would greatly improve our
                            position if the world could understand more clearly what in fact is
                            happening there. In particular, any landing operations in Northern
                            Viet-nam would be much more likely to escape from international
                            condemnation if world opinion understands the character of the attack
                            which is now being mounted from the north against Diem. One grave
                            question here is whether certain kinds of information available to the
                            United States should on balance be brought to the surface and placed
                            before the United Nations. This matter is still under study.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> made it plain that no decision was being
                            sought at this meeting, but that it would be most helpful in planning if
                            it could be understood that the President would at some future time have
                            a willingness to decide to intervene if the situation seemed to him to
                            require it.</p>
                        <p>The President in reply offered no decision, but he made it very plain
                            that he himself is at present very reluctant to make a decision to go
                            into Laos. He believed that the negotiations in Geneva should be pressed
                            forward, that we should not get ourselves badly separated from the
                            British, that the American people were not eager to get into Laos, that
                            nothing would be worse than an unsuccessful intervention in this area,
                            and that he did not yet have confidence in the military practicability
                            of the proposal which had been put before him; though he was eager to
                            have it studied more carefully. The Secretary of State then turned the
                            discussion to the economics of the situation. <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0277"/>He thought it important not ever to
                            tell the President that any active military intervention would be cheap,
                            and he pointed out that by comparison other instruments were very
                            inexpensive indeed, and that we ought to examine what we might do in
                            Southeast Asia if there were no budgetary limitation upon the use of
                            such other instruments. Saving Southeast Asia would be worth a lot of
                            money and doing it without U.S. forces would be worth a lot more.
                            Discussion then turned to the Staley report on Vietnam, and the
                            President agreed to the general line of argument presented by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>’s argument was drawn from a
                            memorandum of the Secretary of State to the President, which is attached
                            to this record.)<note n="2" xml:id="d109fn2">This memorandum, dated July
                                28, summarizes the Staley Report recommendations and their probable
                                costs and concludes:</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> also discussed briefly a plan for a line of credit
                            to Thailand proposed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YKT1">Young</persName>, and the President emphasized that long-term
                            credits of this sort should not be publicly discussed during the debate
                            on foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>“It is recognized that Congress has cut aid funds at a time when
                            additional demands are increasing. Cuts are particularly acute in
                            Supporting Assistance ($131 million cut in Senate and $100 million in
                            House) and the Contingency Fund ($200 million cut in each House) from
                            which the bulk of the Viet-Nam program and additions thereto will
                            derive. Nevertheless I believe that the critical situation in Southeast
                            Asia warrants priority in proceeding with the program in the report. It
                            will promote the internal and external security of VietNam. It will
                            strengthen the Government, especially in its relations with the rural
                            population. It will bring this larger part of the population more
                            securely within the nation. It will help Viet-Nam move toward a
                            self-sustaining economy. Finally, it will demonstrate our own solidarity
                            with South East Asia.”</p>
                        <p>Returning to the military problems, the President emphasized the need for
                            more accurate assessment of the situation in the future. He indicated
                            that it would be wise for anyone making current military recommendations
                            to examine the fate of earlier assessments. He indicated his hope that
                            someone well known to him could go out and look at the situation
                            directly, and while there might be arguments against having General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in Laos, it emerged
                            in the discussion that it might be good for him to go to Viet-Nam and to
                            learn what he could about the whole situation from that area. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> proposed to look
                            first at the problem itself to make clear what facts need to be
                            checked.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the President proposed the following five courses of action: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We should be closely on top of the conference in Geneva. He
                                    would like a weekly report of progress on that front.</item>

                                <item>There would be continued effort to frame a satisfactory
                                    government. If we could get an arrangement with the King in the
                                    lead, so much the better. Actual names and numbers of the
                                    players would now be discussed.</item>

                                    proposals is whether they would have an impact upon Vietnamese

                                level here, I would think that any military mission to Viet-Nam
                                should include a visit to Laos and Thailand. What we are trying to
                                determine are the realities in the military situation. In
                                particular, we want to know whether the necessary cooperative
                                military action between Laos, Viet-Nam and Thailand can be put
                                together in time to control the situation on the ground. We are
                                inclined to think that it would be a good rather than a bad
                                diplomatic move for an American military mission to visit Southeast
                                Asia.</item>

                        <p>Until we are farther along in our present area planning we think it
                            premature to send a mission. Undoubtedly new questions will be arising
                            which we do not think of now. On the other hand the rainy season will
                            soon be over; and our ducks should then be in a row.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Staley</persName>’s group has several
                            achievements to its credit. It contributed to the continuing effort to
                            create a more cooperative atmosphere in our relations; it obtained
                            Diem’s agreement in principle to de facto devaluation and a single
                            exchange rate for imports of U.S. aid; it reached agreement with the
                            Vietnamese on criteria to govern imports under the U.S.-financed
                            commercial import program; it obtained acceptance by Diem of the
                            desirability of short-range economic impact programs; it obtained some
                            acceptance of the fact that U.S. aid is not the solution to VietNam’s
                            local currency financing problems; it laid the basis for continuing
                            consultation on economic matters through parallel committees; and it
                            pressed on Diem the need for long-range economic planning.</p>
                        <p>But the group was unable to come up with firm estimates or programs and
                            much work remains to be done on the estimates and programs in the
                            report; it did not re-examine the total U.S. aid effort or even the
                            relationship between its own proposals and the existing aid program; it
                            did not get very clear commitments as to the extent and character of the
                            Vietnamese contribution to the total effort. On balance then, the Staley
                            group made an important contribution, but much remains to be done.</p>
                        <p>The deficiencies of the report have been a source of some difficulty in
                            developing the U.S. response to it. But behind the differences that
                            developed within the Executive Branch over our response was a more basic
                            issue which is a source of continuing debate on various Vietnamese
                            problems. Some agencies (notably <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0282"/>State and Defense) are of the view that we can best achieve Vietnamese
                            action on needed political, military and economic reforms, not by
                            specific conditions on our aid, but by creating a general atmosphere of
                            cooperation and confidence. They believe that the application of this
                            approach during the last six months has produced a significant
                            improvement in Vietnamese performance. They recognize the difficulties
                            with the estimates in the Staley Report, but believe that for
                            psychological reasons we should endorse the report as far as we can now
                            and then get on quickly with the refinement of the estimates and
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>Other agencies (e.g., Budget and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>
                            staff levels) stress the need for Vietnamese action if the proposed
                            programs are to succeed and believe that such action is much more likely
                            to be forthcoming if our aid is specifically conditioned upon Vietnamese
                            performance with respect to particular needed reforms. On the basis of
                            past experience they are inclined to be skeptical of the prospects for
                            getting action out of Diem on the basis of an approach which places
                            primary emphasis upon developing a spirit of mutual cooperation. The
                            letter to President Diem represents something of a compromise between
                            these two views, but in general tends toward the first and goes about as
                            far as we reasonably can go in endorsing the Staley Report. The success
                            of the compromise will depend notably on the success of the joint
                            committees in making the criteria stick.</p>

                        <p>The most important single commitment in the letter to President Diem is
                            the endorsement of a 30,000 man increase in Vietnamese forces. The
                            Staley Report itself made no recommendation on this subject which was
                            outside its terms of reference. The rationale for this increase is
                            contained on page 4 of the Memorandum from the Acting Secretary of
                            State. (The Ambassador’s case on political grounds for the increase is
                            contained in the attached telegram.)<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">No
                                telegram was found attached to the source text, but this is
                                apparently a reference to <ref target="#d92">Document

                            Department’s statement of rationale does not cover such important
                            subjects as the extent to which these forces are intended to meet a
                            threat of overt attack from the North as contrasted with the internal
                                threat;<note n="5" xml:id="d112fn5">The Staley Report contains a
                                Vietnamese estimate that 90 percent of the existing Vietnamese armed
                                forces are committed to the counter-insurgency effort. It is
                                difficult to evaluate this estimate. The U.S. military are inclined
                                to give it general credence. My view is that it involves a somewhat
                                generous definition of “counter-insurgency effort”; but I am not
                                prepared from this distance to challenge the present disposition of
                                the Vietnamese order of battle. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> how they will be deployed; the kind of training that
                            they will receive; and the specific effects of such a buildup on the <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0283"/>civilian economy. We lack in
                            Washington the specific information and plans necessary to answer these
                            questions. In particular, we shall need a mutually agreed,
                            geographically-phased strategic plan for dealing with the Viet Cong
                            before we can answer them with assurance. The difficulty in getting this
                            town to answer these questions is one reason I advocate sending the
                            ablest military mission we can muster to the field.</p>
                        <p>In the light of these ambiguities the letter to Diem suggests the need
                            for a plan and for an understanding on the training and use of the
                            30,000 additional men before the buildup begins. It was not considered
                            desirable, however, specifically to condition the increase upon such
                            understandings.</p>
                        <p>The letter contains a general commitment to provide the commercial import
                            program that will be required-provided it can be justified under the
                            seven criteria contained in the report (page 3 of the telegram). The
                            instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName><note n="6" xml:id="d112fn6">The instructions
                                were transmitted in telegram 140, <ref target="#d113">Document

                            authorize him to say that the increased generation of piasters under the
                            new effective exchange rate will not serve to reduce the U.S. share of
                            the aid effort (last page of the telegram). Since the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962 Congressional presentation provides
                            less than we provided under the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                            program ($95 million v. $115 million), this statement could involve a
                            minimum commitment of $20 million aid beyond that contained in the
                            Congressional presentation. The cost table in the memorandum from the
                            Secretary (page 2) uses such a $20 million addition as the bottom end of
                            the range for this program. On the other hand, the commitment might be
                            met through <gloss target="#t_PL2">PL</gloss> 480 or by drawing down the
                            pipeline.</p>
                        <p>The telegram states that you are directing Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> to conduct through the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in Viet-Nam a thorough and
                            expeditious review of the short-range economic program contained in the
                            Staley Report and of related existing U.S. aid projects. The parallel
                            committees are to develop specific longer range development
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>An important part of the letter and the instructions to the Ambassador is
                            the emphasis upon economic development planning and the related emphasis
                            upon seeking to get Diem to use our new joint economic efforts as a
                            means of projecting to VietNam, its friends and its enemies, an image of
                            a nation confident in its long-range future.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in accordance with your wishes, the instructions to the
                            Ambassador would have him give added emphasis to the importance we
                            attach to Vietnamese adherence to the seven criteria governing imports
                            and to its commitment to a higher piaster rate of exchange.</p>

                            refer to planning. In order to derive long-range benefits from our joint
                            efforts to win in the present emergency, Viet-Nam needs long-range
                            planning. To develop and carry out a long-range plan, Viet-Nam needs its
                            own planners and the help of experts from outside. In the context of a
                            long-range plan and considering the limitations that the agreed criteria
                            place upon imports, the capital goods component of the commodity aid
                            program can be expanded. It should be made clear that long-range
                            planning and the increase in capacity to absorb capital goods will
                            facilitate the flow of American development assistance. In focusing on
                            such a Plan as an urgent item of current business, the nation can be
                            inspired and consolidated. The U.S. is willing to help the long-range
                            development effort with men and resources, and without diminishing in
                            any way the U.S. support for the present counter-insurgency effort. We
                            hope that one consequence of our new joint efforts will be an effective
                            projection to the nation, its friends and its enemies, of our confidence
                            in a long-range future for an independent VietNam. In this connection,
                            the Ambassador should seek discreetly to impress upon President Diem
                            that he should use the total U.S. program for the greatest political
                            effect in his achievement of maximum appreciation of his government by
                            the people of Viet-Nam and the people of the world. (It is hoped that
                            the Ambassador will continue his efforts to <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0285"/>persuade President Diem to engage more fully in his
                            civic action program non-Communist elements now in political
                            opposition.) This is, of course, part of a continuing effort that must
                            be made with President Diem and his government generally.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> should make
                            clear in his presentation that, if this is to be a truly joint effective
                            effort, action by each country must be related to that by the other. In
                            particular we attach great importance to the reasonable implementation
                            of the agreed criteria governing imports; we also consider the raising
                            of the effective piaster rate applicable to U.S. commodity aid, to which
                            it is understood President Diem has already agreed, an indispensable
                            part of our effort. Action by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on
                            both of these matters will be very closely related to the U.S.
                            contribution to the overall effort. The Ambassador may assure President
                            Diem that increased piaster realization per dollar’s worth of imports
                            will not be used as a reason for reducing the American share of our
                            joint efforts.</p>
                        <p>President Diem and his government need to be reminded of adverse
                            criticism that our Viet-Nam program has experienced in the Congress and
                            in the American press generally favorable to his cause, and to be
                            discreetly warned that the program cannot profit from further attack. In
                            the avoidance of such attack, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            itself plays the essential role.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Eugene Staley</persName> has told me personally of
                            the mission which he and his special financial group undertook to
                            Viet-Nam at my request. He has told me of the courteous and
                            understanding welcome he received from you and from the members of your
                            government, and has described to me the progress you have already made
                            despite the great difficulties of Communist subversion which you face. I
                            was pleased to hear of the cooperative and friendly spirit which
                            animated the meetings of the Vietnamese and <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0286"/>American experts. It is particularly encouraging to me
                            that this spirit of cooperation, which was embodied in the joint
                            undertakings of the counter-insurgency plan and which was so evident
                            during the visit of Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, will now be carried on through the very
                            practical medium of parallel Vietnamese and American committees.</p>
                        <p>I have examined the joint action program which the Vietnamese and
                            American experts propose<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">See <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> and I heartily agree
                            with the three basic tenets on which their recommendations are based,
                            namely: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Security requirements must, for the present, be given first
                                    priority.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Military operations will not achieve lasting results unless
                                    economic and social programs are continued and
                                    accelerated.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>It is in our joint interest to accelerate measures to achieve
                                    a self-sustaining economy and a free and peaceful society in
                                    VietNam.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I also agree that we are more likely to succeed if both of our countries
                            take adequate action now than if we react to the Communist threat by
                            slow and insufficient measures.</p>
                        <p>I consider that the joint action program put before us by our expert
                            groups offers a sound foundation on which our two governments can build
                            rapidly and successfully. Therefore, having in mind your letter of June
                                9<note n="3" xml:id="d114fn3">See <ref target="#d69fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 69</ref>.</note> and the strong recommendation of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>, I should like
                            to inform you that the United States will provide equipment and
                            assistance in training as needed for an increase in the armed forces of
                            Viet-Nam from 170,000 to 200,000 men. In order to make such an increase
                            as effective as possible I suggest that before the time when the level
                            of 170,000 is reached our governments should satisfy themselves on the
                            following points: (1) That there then exists a mutually agreed upon,
                            geographically phased strategic plan for bringing Viet-Cong subversion
                            in the Republic of Viet-Nam under control; (2) That on the basis of such
                            a plan there exists an understanding on the training and use of these
                            30,000 additional men; (3) That the rate of increase from 170,000 to
                            200,000 will be regulated to permit the most efficient absorption and
                            utilization of additional personnel and material in the Vietnamese armed
                            forces with due regard to VietNam’s resources.</p>
                        <p>I also suggest, in view of the fact that the force level of 200,000 will
                            probably not be reached until late in 1962, that decision regarding a
                            further increase above 200,000 be postponed until next year when the
                            question can be re-examined on the basis of the situation which we shall
                            then be facing. Meanwhile, the buildup in <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0287"/>equipment and training of the Civil Guard and Self
                            Defense Corps within already agreed levels should be expedited.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the joint action program, I am most encouraged to learn of
                            the large measure of agreement reached by our expert groups on the steps
                            required to meet the piaster financing problems posed by the joint
                            action program. It seems to me that in the light of these
                            recommendations we can move forward simultaneously on measures to solve
                            this problem by a combination of actions by the two governments: by the
                            Government of the United States, within the limits of available funds,
                            to provide the external resources which are required, including
                            commodity imports which can be justified and absorbed under the seven
                            criteria of the joint action program; and by the Government of VietNam,
                            to generate the piasters to direct the resources of Viet-Nam to the
                            highest priority requirements. The several means to acquire such
                            piasters are spelled out in the joint action program. I hope that our
                            parallel committees can immediately cooperate in working out target
                            estimates for an import program which will give both our governments a
                            basis for planning.</p>
                        <p>The early implementation of the joint recommendation of the expert groups
                            regarding tax reform and the principle of a single and realistic rate of
                            exchange, using methods which take into account the political and
                            psychological factors which I know you have to weigh, will certainly
                            increase the effectiveness of American aid to VietNam. I hope this
                            recommendation can be implemented soon. Within the limits of funds to be
                            made available by the Congress and within the agreed criteria, my policy
                            shall be to help you as much as possible to achieve a break-through in
                            your efforts to bring security to your people and to build toward
                            economic independence.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the experts’ joint recommendations for emergency social action
                            and to the direct aid programs already under way, I am asking Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName>, Director of
                            International Cooperation, to conduct through <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Viet-Nam a thorough and expeditious review with your
                            experts of the new proposals and of other programs which these proposals
                            were intended to supplement. Among these I mention as of special
                            interest the fields of communications, including television and radio;
                            agrovilles, land development, agricultural credit and agricultural
                            extension; extended assistance to road building; continued efforts to
                            expand education, particularly primary and elementary education in the
                            villages; training for rural administration; and plans to assure more
                            and better equipped and trained officials, adequately compensated,
                            especially in rural areas and in the villages. Our basic premise is that
                            these programs be designed with your government to meet your needs and
                            conditions, and that they be carried out by your people, with our
                            assistance where required. I especially wish <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to offer whatever help you think will be <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0288"/>most effective to strengthen the vital
                            ties of loyalty between the people of Free Viet-Nam and their
                            government.</p>
                        <p>As an integral part of our efforts to meet the current crises, I believe
                            it is essential that we continue and expand the progress which has
                            already been made toward the long range development of VietNam. The
                            emergency measures which we undertake should be solidly anchored-as soon
                            as possible-in a comprehensive long range planning process to determine
                            the best uses which can be made of available resources on a time-phased
                            basis. Only in this way can we adequately meet the long and short term
                            requirements which interact in the problems which our two countries must
                            solve together. This will require the creation of more effective
                            planning machinery as recommended in the joint report of our experts. In
                            addition to development of a long range plan, the training of staff to
                            carry on planning activities (covering such matters as the use of
                            medical manpower and teachers for which Viet-Nam has competing
                            civilian-military requirements) might be expedited. I urge that our
                            parallel committees develop specific projects in line with the general
                            recommendations of the report.</p>
                        <p>In the face of competing and urgent demands for aid and assistance from
                            countries throughout the world we shall make our contribution to the
                            future of VietNam. Our support of VietNam’s independence and development
                            will, as I have assured you in the past, remain among the highest
                            priorities of American foreign policy. As indicated above, we are
                            prepared to commit, within the limits of our available aid funds,
                            substantial resources to assist you in carrying out the military and
                            economic and social components of the special action program. In order
                            to speed the action during this emergency period and to permit greater
                            flexibility I should like to emphasize that the chief responsibility for
                            the planning and execution of the American share of the program will,
                            more than ever, rest with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> and, under his direction, with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>. In this connection I hope that, with the delegation
                            of maximum authority to the parallel committees as recommended by our
                            experts, the committees will assure follow-up action, approve
                            modifications of the program and “recommend measures to improve and
                            adapt the special action program as the situation changes.”</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I believe that we have now agreed on sound ways to
                            strengthen the Vietnamese economy and Vietnamese security in the face of
                            the mounting Communist threat. Now we can proceed to develop additional
                            concrete plans and carry them out rapidly and effectively.</p>
                        <p>I firmly believe that if our countries continue to work so effectively
                            together, the Almighty will grant us the strength and the will to

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM1">Couve de Murville</persName> asked the
                            Secretary whether he wished to say something on VietNam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would be glad to do so and that he would appreciate
                            any comments which his British and French colleagues would like to
                            make.</p>
                        <p>He said we have been working with Diem in bringing about improvements in
                            the economic and military field. We have been <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0290"/>working in conformity with the
                            counter-insurgency plan and on economic plans which might help to bring
                            the situation in Viet Nam under control.</p>
                        <p>Vietnamese military forces have had some successes with their
                            counter-insurgency tactics. We are also prepared to put in larger
                            resources to strengthen the civil situation. All of these efforts
                            encounter the problem of intimidation by the communist insurgency
                            throughout the country. One of our great concerns is the flow of fresh
                            elements from North Viet-Nam through Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we plan to make a very substantial investment of
                            effort in South VietNam. There are advantages in Viet Nam as compared
                            with Laos-a better army with a will to fight, a better economy and in
                            fact a situation in general far in advance of conditions in Laos.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM1">Couve</persName> said that the United States
                            is doing the maximum amount to help the Vietnamese. On the military
                            side, he understood that the Secretary thought the situation not too
                            bad. The Secretary interposed that he thought it was not too bad and not
                            too good. Couve went on to say that the real problem is always the same,
                            namely, the domestic political problem. He said the difficulty is to
                            change the present government, which is a strong government, into a
                            popular government. He thought we had all more or less failed in our
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CM1">Couve</persName> went on to say Diem and the
                            people around him are from the central part of Viet-Nam around Hue, and
                            that it has been impossible up to now to give more positions in the
                            government to the Cochin-Chinese. Couve said he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> about this, and that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> had said he thought this was
                            the heart of the problem. The elite of the Cochin-Chinese south has the
                            feeling that it is excluded from the government and is therefore in the
                            opposition.</p>
                        <p>Lord Home said the British think the situation in Viet-Nam has gotten a
                            little worse.<note n="2" xml:id="d115fn2">According to a memorandum of
                                conversation between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
                                Lord Home on August 6, Home implied that British reports indicated
                                that many considered Diem “hopeless.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that Diem was improving but that he
                                feared “it would be a long drawn-out matter.” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed his hope that the
                                countries in the area-Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and others-could
                                form a regional organization which countries like India could
                                support, thus permitting the demise of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. (Ibid.)</note> He said that the British have
                            made arrangements to send Colonel <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> to Viet Nam with rather a small mission. There
                            is nothing that <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> doesn’t
                            know about counter-insurgency methods, and he should be able to be of
                            help. Lord Home said that he didn’t know how the government could be
                            made more popular.</p>
                        <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0291"/>
                        <p>Lord Home remarked that the problem is Diem, who continues to exhibit his
                            well-known defects, but there is no alternative but to try to help him
                            improve.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Couve</persName> for his
                            observations about the Cochin-Chinese, and said he thought we might do
                            something about trying to get more of them into the government. He said
                            it might be helpful if the French could give us some suggestions
                            regarding able Cochin-Chinese who might be brought into the government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CM1">Couve</persName> agreed to do this.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">No paper from the French Government along

                        <p>I greeted President Diem with remark that I hoped he was as pleased by
                            the tone and content of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s letter as were the members of our task force
                            here in Saigon, as it appeared to us to represent another major landmark
                            in US resolve to help his country. To my surprise and annoyance, he
                            responded that he had found in it no “figures about the amount of US
                            aid”. I said that we would get to that later, but first I would like
                            with his permission to underline certain points in connection with the
                            President’s message. We then proceeded to review the letter and in the
                            course of discussion, I made the following points: <list>

                                <item>In adopting the major recommendations of the joint

                                    only re-enforced its already large commitment to Viet-Nam but
                                    had also <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0292"/>adopted a new
                                    “break-through” philosophy of action which we are prepared to
                                    follow up to the extent that the necessary decisions and actions
                                    by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> make possible. I said
                                    that in my opinion progress already made by cooperative action
                                    had been remarkable The Tempo and efficiency of programs in many
                                    fields in order to put the Viet Cong definitely on the defensive
                                    military politically and psychologically [sic]. We shared
                                    President Diem’s feelings that it is not enough to win a few
                                    battles and score successes here and there, but that we had to
                                    systematize our joint efforts and mount an increasing, broad,
                                    systematic offensive in all fields.</item>

                                    gratified by the recent successes of the Vietnamese forces, but
                                    there still seemed to be lacking an over-all strategic plan to

                                        identified.</note> which he had sent to the President urging
                                    the development and adoption of such a plan. I realized the
                                    extreme sensitivity of such a plan, but we wished to be assured
                                    that one existed or would exist just as soon as possible.</item>

                                <item>With regard to the financing of the joint action program, it
                                    was clear that a part of the additional costs would be in
                                    piasters, which only the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                                    could produce. The seven criteria developed by the joint experts
                                    group as guidelines to regulate the type and volume of US
                                    commercial imports<note n="5" xml:id="d116fn5">See <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> were designed,
                                    not to conserve US aid dollars, but to protect the Vietnamese
                                    economy and to assure a program of US aid which could be
                                    justified before our Congress and people as contributing to the
                                    kind of economic and social development of Viet-Nam which we
                                    both desire. At the beginning of our conversation, President
                                    Diem had inquired about an aid figure. I thought frankly that we
                                    could best arrive at a constructive solution if we approached
                                    the matter from a different point of view. I asked the President
                                    to accept my assurance that we would be willing, within the
                                    limits of appropriated funds and the agreed criteria, to set
                                    high targets for the importation of US commercial aid goods. We
                                    would then see what amount could in fact be absorbed within the
                                    agreed criteria. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                                    interjected that he hoped we would not be rigid in determining
                                    the type of goods which could be imported under the criteria,
                                    and said that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s long-range
                                    planning could <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0293"/>not go
                                    forward without assurances for the future. I replied that we
                                    expected the criteria to be maintained, but that I saw no reason
                                    why we could not agree on the types of goods to be imported. A
                                    part of the problem is obviously the number of piasters
                                    generated by each dollar’s worth of imports. My government hoped
                                    and expected that a definite decision would be taken promptly by
                                    the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to increase
                                    substantially the piaster yield. This is necessary if the joint
                                    program is to be accomplished.</item>

                                <item><p>There followed a discussion of the need promptly to
                                        organize parallel committees for planning and
                                        implementation. I reminded Diem that the first time we had
                                        had a conversation together, at Dalat several months
                                            ago,<note n="6" xml:id="d116fn6">Not further
                                            identified.</note> he had mentioned the desirability of
                                        developing an over-all plan. I said we warmly welcomed this
                                        idea, and the experts’ report stressed the need of
                                        committees to plan systematically, establish priorities, and
                                        follow through on implementation. As President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s letter had said,
                                        the US was prepared, in this special crisis situation in
                                        Viet Nam, to give maximum flexibility to its representatives
                                        in Viet Nam; by the same token, it was necessary to the
                                        Vietnamese Govt to set itself up in a manner which would
                                        delegate authority and make possible close and rapid
                                        coordination of effort.</p>
                                    <p>Again reverting to the piaster question, I said that it would
                                        be necessary promptly to establish a higher piaster yield on
                                        dollar imports, on the understanding that the US would not
                                        use increased piaster yield as a reason for diminishing its
                                        own contribution. The whole purpose was to increase our
                                        joint effort. To arrive at definite results, it was
                                        necessary promptly to sit down in a committee and to reach
                                        definite decisions. At this point I had the opportunity to
                                        emphasize the value of long-range economic planning and
                                        programs which could stimulate the sale of US imports in the
                                        private sector. Diem, catching the point, said he thought
                                        that certain of this [his?] road building projects, as well
                                        as city development projects might be done through private
                                        Vietnamese-Chinese enterprise, which would expand the market
                                        for US imports and generate piasters.</p>

                                <item>Turning to action in the political and psychological fields, I
                                    said my govt felt that the new decisions embodied in President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s letter were
                                    sufficiently great and far-reaching to warrant their use by Pres
                                    Diem in a major campaign to inspire the nation and to build
                                    broader and more solid political support for his regime. I
                                    mentioned the fact that in the US and in the world press
                                    generally, while sympathetic understanding of Viet Nam and its
                                    govt had increased, there was still room for improvement and
                                    that President Diem himself could contribute greatly to this. I
                                    said that certain <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0294"/>members of our congress think that more can and should be done
                                    in the direction of social and political consolidation and
                                    progress, and that we wished to establish an aid program on a
                                    solid basis of congressional support which would assure its
                                    continuance. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> picked
                                    up this point and suggested that a joint communiqué should be
                                    issued. He said he thought this might be the occasion for a
                                    “psychological shock” campaign, to rally the country. I said I
                                    felt that President Diem should seriously consider launching a
                                    drive to gain Vietnamese public confidence in its govt, using
                                    the adoption of the experts’ report, plus perhaps speeches by
                                    radio in which Pres Diem could make an appeal for national unity
                                    and offer opportunity within the new program to Vietnamese who
                                    had for one reason or another stood aside from govt activity. I
                                    suggested that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and
                                    I might come up with some ideas for the Pres on this, and he
                                    seemed to agree, but added that he might use the occasion again
                                    to explain the need for self-sacrifice under the doctrine of
                                    “personalism”.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>While Diem did not commit himself to anything specific during this
                            conversation, he warmed up considerably to the opportunities offered by
                            Pres <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s letter. Certainly
                            the discussion ended more hopefully than it began, although I tried
                            unsuccessfully to pin him down on fiscal reform. His attitude did not
                            seem unappreciative or evasive; but he has a habit of thinking in terms
                            of a series of immediate things to be done, to get wound up in details,
                            and to neglect to develop a broad pattern of systematic action. I
                            returned to the question of systematic planning by committee on several
                            occasions, and while he gave a generally favorable response, it was
                            clear that he was worried by the feeling that any such delegation of
                            responsibility might take out of his hands the detailed planning and
                            direction for which he has such an appetite. Nevertheless, I think we
                            have made some real headway. It was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and I should get together
                            promptly to sort out matters and determine where we go from here. At
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s suggestion, we agreed
                            that the first thing to be considered would be a possible communiqué (or
                            some other method of “choc psychologique”), to be followed promptly by a
                            designation of parallel committees for planning and implementation.</p>
                        <p>Before departing, I asked Diem whether there was any special word he
                            wanted me to get back to Pres <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>. He said please to express his sincere
                            appreciation for the message, to which he would like to give further
                            study and thought. To my suggestion that we should immediately proceed
                            to organize committees for planning, to estimate costs, and to solve the
                            financial problems, he agreed and <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0295"/>left it to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            and me to pursue. We shall do so and report further.</p>

                            to increase as result, they are not in position to sustain large-scale

                            to secure “liberated area” in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> in

                            operations. They might however by indirect means achieve their
                            intermediate objective of overthrowing Diem if continued or stepped up
                            guerrilla activities were to engender frustration in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> armed forces to point of bringing about

                        <p>2. We cannot predict with assurance when <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will produce geographically phased national plan for
                            systematic elimination of Viet Cong. We have been pressing for this ever

                                    factors, among them strength of Viet Cong in area, threat they
                                    pose to important localities, their proximity to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Laotian border,

                        <p>National <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss> must provide for flexibility
                            sufficient to allow all agencies to react to changes in character and
                            location of Viet Cong threat. Basic military concept of bringing entire
                            country under governmental control is based on locating <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and eliminating them in successive areas.
                            Larger groups would be located through use of net forces such as Rangers
                            and eliminated with spear type forces such as regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> battalions. Small <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> groups or individuals more or less
                            indigenous to their hamlet or village would be located and dealt with by
                            civil guard and self-defense corps. This concept requires that civil and
                            military leaders down to hamlet level, as part of <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0299"/>“preparation phase”, know of planned
                            operations long enough in advance to coordinate and cooperate in
                            preparing target area, intelligence wise and psychologically, prior to
                            actual attack-as well as during and after military phase. Concept also
                            requires upgrading of civil guard and self-defense corps through
                            provision of equipment and adequate training program now in progress. To
                            assure peasants and villagers in given area that they will have
                            continuing protection, and thus inducing them to furnish intelligence on
                            indigenous <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> individuals or small groups
                            as well as any information which may reach them on larger groups.</p>
                        <p>Because of advanced development of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            control, they are so strongly entrenched in certain areas that
                            successful military operations against them are necessary prerequisite
                            to effective political, economic or psychological action in area.
                            However, political, psychological and economic elements must also be
                            employed as integral part of this military phase whenever applicable and
                            to full degree possible. For these reasons in Viet-Nam it is necessary
                            to give priority to military phase of counter-insurgent operations, in
                            order that other and equally important elements of final victory can be
                            fully exploited in phases which must immediately follow or whenever
                            possible accompany actual military operations.</p>
                        <p>Phasing of plan should extend, not only to geographical areas to be
                            cleared by military operations, but should also include progressively
                            phased actions whereby cleared area would be returned to normal peace
                            time conditions. These actions can be designated as “preparation phase”
                            which precedes military operations end [and?] establishes proper element
                            of acceptance for “military phase” during which area would be cleared of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. This is then followed by
                            “security phase” which is final phase permanently installing civil
                            government in cleared area under governmental control as well as
                            insuring its continued security. This requires pre-planned occupation by
                            paramilitary, provincial security forces as other civil agencies under

                            preparing these forces for accomplishment these missions. Until one year
                            ago, training emphasis was being placed primarily on preparing for

                            operations. At that time only small percentage of training was devoted
                            counter-guerrilla type training. In view of insurgency situation this
                            was considered inadequate. As result <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommendations <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss>

                            along counter-guerrilla lines. This program consists of individual,

                            has approved to date are limited in scope and intention: to build
                            intelligence base and provide foundation for restricted harassment and
                            sabotage. This is designed to maintain hope of liberation in north and

                            premature violent uprising which would be repressed for lack of
                            sufficient support from free world. Diem also sees that larger scale
                            attacks upon <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> would extend <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>’s liberty of action against <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> when he has enough problems from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>’s covert attacks.

                            recent months and would of course like to see action taken to clean up
                            that area. Any decision on part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            to throw sizable force into this effort would be grave one not only
                            because it would represent broadening of war in which <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> now engaged but because of limited
                            available <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces to meet current
                            military needs. Believe however that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            would seriously consider as part cooperative effort commitment some
                            additional forces beyond small number of Vietnamese Special Forces and
                            regulars now engaged in Laos and along Lao border. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials continue to talk in admiring
                            and favorable terms about use of Pakistani troops in Laos, but we are
                            not in position judge practicality of this idea. Diem might not insist
                            upon actual involvement of US combat forces at outset of cooperative
                            action in Laos but would certainly seek to obtain clear commitment by US
                            to send in combat forces if need developed.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations Laos tactically and
                            strategically sound and desirable. Due guerrilla war now going on in
                            Viet Nam <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military forces immediately
                            available for cooperative action in Laos could probably consist only
                            additional small units somewhat similar those now in Laos (principally
                            along route 9) but with perhaps broader role, possibly to include
                            limited combat support of Lao units. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            might as calculated risk commit larger forces to Laos with view toward
                            preventing intensified future <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            infiltration through Laos, but sizable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operation in Laos could probably be considered only
                            within time frame required to mobilize, train and equip additional
                            forces now planned but not yet available. Forces being added under
                            30,000 increase will provide additional capability but these not
                            available in significant numbers before late 1962. Should be recognized
                            that, if the above occurs, there is possibility <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0303"/>that increased enemy action will force
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to escalate its forces committed
                            across Lao border beyond whatever level it originally decides-e.g.,
                            small to sizable. In latter case it important it be kept in mind that
                            additional 30,000 increment is required for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> primary task of defeating insurgency within Viet Nam at
                            approximately its present intensity.</p>
                        <p>Bangkok and Vientiane much better qualified than me to comment on

                            Laos. From Saigon it would appear that <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> could be persuaded without much trouble as we
                            believe there is inclination on his part at times to throw in towel re
                            northern Laos, withdraw his forces to south and attempt set up separate
                            government there. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> would
                            probably regard cooperative effort in southern Laos as at least giving
                            him greater assurance of being able hold out there if he is obliged give
                            up north.</p>
                        <p>Would appear to US Sarit might be harder to convince that southern Laos
                            should have priority as against occupying all parts of Laos adjacent to
                            Mekong and thus bordering Thailand. We would assume if enough outside
                            support thrown in (e.g., Pakistani troops) to conduct both operations,
                            Sarit would willingly cooperate on southern Laos operation as well.</p>
                        <p>Above is based on my understanding first question under five refers to
                            cooperative action just as remaining two questions do. If, however,
                            first question stands alone and refers to unilateral <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troop employment in eastern Laos for

                            official exchange rate, 25 representing new “economic development and
                            defense tax”, and average 14 from other taxes. We believe this
                            represents real progress as this is decision which has been sought by US
                            for several years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> frankly stated this is
                            devaluation in everything but name, but stressed importance of avoiding
                            labeling it as devaluation publicly and officially. When I asked why
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> adopting complex system of taxes
                            and subsidies rather than direct simple approach <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied with smile that it was
                            because of complexity. He explained that psychologically masses will not
                            understand that rate has been changed, and political and social results
                            will therefore be limited. On other hand if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> were to announce change in official rate everyone would
                            know what is taking place and results would be much more severe.</p>
                        <p>Two <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> subcommittees have been appointed
                            to work out the necessary and indispensable measures to accompany
                            piaster yield change: First to review and make adjustments in customs
                            tariff and second to recommend further fiscal reform measures. These
                            committees directed to report within 45 days and therefore new rate
                            cannot be placed in effect before that time. Net reduction will result
                            in “other taxes” on imports to achieve new average yield of 14 piasters
                            per dollar (in contrast present yield these taxes of 17 or 18 piasters
                            per dollar on sliding scale from low tax on essentials to higher tax on
                            less essential goods). Subcommittees also working on problem of
                            recapturing windfall profits resulting from new piaster yield approach
                            and measures to increase yield from other than import taxes.</p>
                        <p>All addressees will recognize indispensability of maintaining secrecy
                            about new piaster yield approach until officially announced by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>

                            expenditures 23.4 billion piasters and receipts 20.5 billion piasters.
                            Budgetary breakdown as follows (in billions piasters): Expenditures
                            consist of regular civil budget 8.6, security (including civil guard and

                            (export subsidies and compensation account expenditures) 2.0, one-half
                            of 18-month emergency economic and social program proposed in Staley
                            Report 0.9, and one-half of 18-month long range economic development
                            program proposed in Staley Report 0.5. Receipts consist of counterpart
                            of US-financed commercial aid at official 35 rate 5.9, internal fiscal
                            receipts 4.5, and import taxes (new economic development and defense
                            taxes of 25 piasters per dollar and other taxes of 14 piasters per
                            dollar) 10.1. In calculating above receipts <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> projects import program of 259 million dollars

                            12.7, and GVN’s own foreign exchange 73.8. Under questioning, however,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stated clearly that
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> decision to go to 74-1 yield was
                            not conditional upon US aid figure used in projected budget. He said aid
                            figure used is simply one chosen by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            because it has to use some basis for calculating US aid in making its
                            budgetary projections. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> also
                            stressed that average piaster yield is maximum <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> can do, thus indicating that if actual US aid is less
                            than amount projected in budget <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will
                            have to cut back on program. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that internal receipts item in budget
                            represents increase of 1 billion piasters over 1961, thus showing GVN’s
                            intention to implement <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> report
                            recommendation on tax reform as well as exchange reform recommendation.
                            When questioned re gap of 2.9 billion piasters in budget he said <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would try meet as much as it could by
                            other two <gloss target="#t_SFG1">SFG</gloss> report recommendations:
                            Victory bonds (perhaps up to one billion) and National Bank advances,
                            which has lowest priority of any of methods to be used for financing
                            budget.</p>
                        <p>Budget being analyzed and our detailed comments will follow.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">Apparently a reference to <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>3. I congratulated <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> on
                            adoption joint report<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">See <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> breakthrough concept, as reflected in
                            1962 budget. I explained we could make no decision at this time re US
                            aid level because Congress has not yet completed action on aid
                            legislation. I also said that my approach toward aid level problem was
                            to let joint experts report criteria be sole guide, since I saw no
                            possible way of choosing realistic import figure at this time. I
                            indicated I was not sure whether Washington would agree with this
                            approach, and in any case we <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0309"/>would shortly have to come up with a temporary figure which, as I
                            envisaged, would be subject to revision after several months in light of
                            experience. I also pointed out that in addition to commercial aid DLF
                            offered possibilities for financing import of capital goods, and could
                            under certain circumstances be used to generate piasters for current
                            government use. Got no reaction to this.</p>
                        <p>Thanh was reluctant agree to my proposed approach of fixing only
                            temporary aid level figure because he foresaw various practical
                            difficulties such as delays in goods arrivals pending agreement on final
                            figure, speculation and price increases. I believe however he eventually
                            acceded to approach we proposed, particularly because of emphasis we
                            place on flexibility given to field in President Kennedy’s letter to
                            President Diem.<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4"><ref target="#d114">Document
                                    114</ref>.</note> Thanh stated however that for practical
                            purposes review of temporary aid level would have to come well prior to
                            expiration of 6-month period.</p>
                        <p>Thanh told us that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> calculates new
                            piaster yield approach will cause only 4 percent increase in cost of
                            living of lower classes. He underlined however importance prompt arrival
                            of adequate quantity of imports to avoid greater effect on cost of
                            living and adverse political repercussions.</p>
                        <p>Thanh asked specifically about addition petroleum products to list
                            eligible commodities for US financing. Gardiner replied he saw no
                            problem in this.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> raised problem of extent
                            to which piaster proceeds of aid should go into counterpart account
                            under new piaster yield approach. He expressed awareness of
                            congressional problems on this score, but asked that we also take a
                            sympathetic look at <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s public
                            relations problems and vulnerability to Communist attack if apparent US
                            hold on Vietnamese economy becomes too evident from budget. He proposed
                            that out of new piaster yield of 74 per dollar 60 go into counterpart
                            fund (which would be real improvement over present deposit rate of 43),
                            but that 25 be released automatically for military budget and emergency
                            development expenditures just as 7 out of current 43 is released
                            automatically for military budget. We replied that we understood <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concern; that this is primarily
                            congressional and legal problem and we would see what we could do to
                            accommodate <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as much as possible.
                            Shall submit recommendations on this point.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> requested that 30 percent
                            of total US commercial aid be exempted from buy American provisions. We
                            also promised we would see what could be done on this score. I said that
                            perhaps we could ask Washington to delegate authority to US in Saigon to
                            go up to 30 percent but on basis case by case decision.</p>
                        <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0310"/>

                            this major step on part <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I took
                            occasion to reiterate US assurance that “increased piaster realization

                            the American share of our joint efforts.” (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 140)<note n="5" xml:id="d124fn5"><ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note></p>

                            letters of July 3<note n="2" xml:id="d125fn2"><ref target="#d52">Document 52</ref>.</note> and August 17<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">In this letter <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> wrote that the Department of Defense

                                (Department of State, Central Files, 751K.5-<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/8-1761)</note> dealing with the level of Vietnamese
                            Armed Forces.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased that the increase from a 150,000 to a 170,000 man force
                            level appears to be moving ahead of schedule and may be completed in
                            November. Concerning the subsequent increase from 170,000 to 200,000, I
                            have noted the President’s suggestion in his letter of August 4 [5] to
                            President Diem <note n="4" xml:id="d125fn4"><ref target="#d114">Document
                                    114</ref>.</note> that before increasing the level from 170,000
                            to 200,000 the two governments should be satisfied that there exists an
                            agreed geographically phased strategic plan for bringing the Viet Cong
                            under control, that the training and use of these 30,000 additional men
                            will be based on such a plan, and that the rate of increase will be
                            phased to Vietnamese absorptive capacities.</p>
                        <p>Your letter of August 17 states that a force level of 200,000 men appears
                            adequate to the Defense Department for the foreseeable future. In the
                            best of circumstances, the 200,000 man level will probably not be
                            reached until May or June 1962. Since this is so far in the future and
                            due to the main threats faced by VietNam, I propose that the question of
                            a further increase above 200,000 men <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0311"/>be carefully reviewed by the Viet-Nam Task Force during
                            January 1962. Their recommendations should be based on the situation
                            then existing in Viet-Nam and in Southeast Asia. A recommendation made
                            then would still allow time for preparation, if it should be decided to
                            support a further increase above 200,000.</p>
                        <p>It is most satisfying to read of the recent victories of the Vietnamese
                            Armed Forces. I hope they will be able to maintain their initiative and
                            that their victories will be followed by increasingly effective civic
                            action.</p>

                            level of supporting assistance (commercial aid) to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in light of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s decision on piaster yield, I would like to submit
                            following analysis of situation and general recommendation.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me we are in a fair way now to mount a “breakthrough”
                            program, to finance it, to accelerate momentum and to carry it forward.
                            There are many clouds on the horizon, not the least of which is Laos,
                            but locally the skies are clearing somewhat and both governmental and
                            public morale have been improved by recent military successes and hopes
                            for the future. We will lose a great opportunity if we do not follow
                            this up rapidly. As Task Force Washington knows, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is capable of adopting paper plans and then failing to
                            follow through unless and until the money is in hand (CF agreement last
                            spring to augment military forces by 20,000, which was slowed in
                            implementation pending agreement on 1961 budget and means of
                            financing).</p>
                        <p>It thus seems to me essential to follow through as promptly as possible
                            on tentative aid level for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962, in
                            order to give the assurance to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            necessary to start carrying out emergency economic <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0312"/>and social programs recommended in
                                <gloss target="#t_CIP1">CIP</gloss>, presidential program, joint
                            experts report, draft joint communiqué, etc., as well as carry on with
                            build-up of armed forces. I continue to think that we should set
                            relatively high targets for commercial imports under the agreed
                            criteria, leaving it up to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to
                            justify their estimates re absorptive capacity, etc., and on clear
                            understanding that estimates are subject to revision in light of
                            experience. If we do it the other way, and set conservative estimates
                            which can be revised upwards in light of experience, I am of the opinion
                            that some, perhaps many, of the essential breakthrough programs will be
                            delayed by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> foot-dragging, perhaps
                            beyond the critical period. What is really involved here is a question
                            of earmarking as possible additional aid for Viet Nam approximately $50
                            million of supporting assistance funds (based on figures cited <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 184).<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">Telegram 184, August 12, furnished the Embassy certain suggestions
                                and instructions regarding financial assistance to Vietnam.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 751K.5-<gloss target="#t_MSP1">MSP</gloss>/8-1261)</note> This relates to a total aid program
                            to Viet Nam of roughly a quarter of a billion dollars. Whether this 50
                            million can actually be used or not remains to be seen. I am strongly of
                            the opinion that, when this matter comes to decision, presumably
                            following passage of aid legislation, it would be in our national
                            interest to earmark these additional funds and to tell <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that they are available if they can be
                            used under the agreed criteria. In this way, and I believe only in this
                            way, can we keep up momentum which has been generated.</p>

                            us to have a crisis in Laos or South Viet Nam at the height of the
                            Berlin crisis. <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> may
                            also consider this a dangerous maneuver and seek to avoid it. He must be
                            concerned with the convulsive reaction a double crisis could produce in
                            the United States and also with its impact on the respective Chinese and
                            Soviet roles in Asia.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> could see
                            certain short range advantages in stepping up the level of Communist
                            military activity in Southeast Asia. It seems to me that we can utilize
                            the concern of the neutrals about the Berlin situation to help deter
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> from taking
                            military action in Southeast Asia. We can do this by making explicit
                            ties between the two situations. I believe this might be usefully done
                            in the President’s speech to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Thus the President might in his speech say that it is in the interest of
                            world peace-in the interests of the Bloc, the Western Powers and the
                            neutrals-that the already very serious crisis over Berlin should not be
                            complicated by a reopening of the war in Laos or by enlarging the scale

                            within the control of the USSR, the President would need to make clear
                            that the struggles in these two countries are not simple indigenous
                            struggles, but are wars supported by the Soviets and the North
                            Vietnamese (with Soviet help) from outside. This would require the

                            equipment of significantly greater proportions into South Vietnam; this
                            infiltration is directly contributing to an apparent strengthening and

                            political growth, greatly assisted by infiltration support capability,
                            out of country and in country indications exist pointing to a possible
                            widespread increase in all forms of subversive activity this fall as the

                                Cambodia. (Ibid.)</note> They did a thorough job. There was nothing
                            new in their presentation of the facts except, perhaps, their emphasis
                            on the build-up of Pathet Lao-Viet-minh forces in Southern Laos and the
                            beginnings of additional pressure on Central Viet-Nam from that area.
                            They concluded <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0321"/>by recommending

                            the beginning of open warfare.</p>

                                <p>“At this time we confront not merely a major crisis over Berlin
                                    but a situation equally dangerous to the peace in Southeast
                                    Asia. It has been my objective since assuming Presidential
                                    responsibility to seek by diplomatic means the negotiation of a
                                    truly independent and neutral Laos. This is clearly desirable in
                                    the interests of the Lao people, the peoples of Southeast Asia
                                    and of world peace itself. The situation as it now stands is
                                    dangerous not merely because we have only a precarious
                                    cease-fire in Laos; it is also dangerous because the territory
                                    of Laos is being used systematically to introduce external
                                    forces into South Vietnam. Only recently, moreover, the
                                    government of Cambodia announced a substantial engagement with
                                    Viet-minh forces operating from within its territory against the
                                    government of South Vietnam.</p>
                                <p>The United States is committed in Laos and in Southeast Asia

                                    world community should understand that there is a danger to the
                                    peace in Southeast Asia to which it must devote constructive
                                    attention in coming days and months despite the more dramatic

                            Malaya to control the Communist insurgency. The “most immediately
                            promising,” according to the Department, were an amnesty resettlement
                            plan to encourage Viet Cong defections and the possibility of denying
                            food supplies to the Viet Cong, especially in the high plateau area
                            where food was scarce and denial could be effective. (Department of

                                aimed at composing hostilities in Laos, unifying it and taking it
                                out of arena of cold war. In light of history of Laotian
                                negotiations, culminating in <persName corresp="#p_PGM1">Pushkin</persName>’s cynical remark that Laos could be “next to
                                last” to be devoured, I cannot believe that a settlement along
                                presently conceived lines will benefit our over-all position in this
                                part of world. Even if communist bloc is not interested in taking
                                over Laos at this time, are they not intent on taking over <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and Thailand; and would not a
                                neutral and necessarily weak Laos be a convenient tool for this

                        <p>Phuoc Thanh, which I recently visited with President, is new province.

                        </list>
                        <p>At the suggestion of Lt. Cdr. <persName corresp="#p_BLCWH1">Bagley</persName>, I am submitting the following thoughts
                            concerning possible steps for countering the extensive and growing
                            infiltration and subversion effort of the Viet Cong in South Vietnam.
                            They are based on three weeks of observation and study of the subversion
                            problem in Vietnam. I make no pretensions to expertise in this field. It
                            should be noted that the focus of my work in Viet-Nam was on the
                            problem-the nature and extent of the Viet Cong’s infiltration effort
                            with particular emphasis on the evidence of North Vietnamese
                            involvement-and not on existing or possible countermeasures.
                            Nonetheless, I am happy to submit for your consideration some random
                            observations on possible steps for meeting this obvious threat to
                            security in South Vietnam. Included are a few suggestions on related
                            matters that General Taylor may wish to consider.</p>
                        <p>The problem: We delude ourselves if we visualize the Viet Cong effort in
                            the South as primarily a movement of large, organized units across the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> borders. It is apparent that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> rely on local recruitment, both by
                            persuasion and by terror, for the bulk of their organization. However,
                            movement by units occurs and appears to be on the increase. It is also
                            clear that the infiltration routes are used <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0333"/>for transfer from the North to the South of military
                            supplies, medical equipment, and other materiel, as well as of agents,
                            trained cadre and unit leaders.</p>
                        <p>The most important infiltration routes are: by sea; across the
                            demilitarized zone, particularly the mountainous and heavily forested
                            western portion; mountain trails through Laos, thence eastward across
                            the border into South Vietnam; from “safe areas” in Cambodia across the
                            Viet-Nam border.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Countermeasures:</hi></p>
                        <p>1. Junk operations—<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence
                            sources report that these are extensive and operate under the control of
                            a special <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> maritime unit operating out
                            of Vinh and Dong Hoi. Some junks have been picked up with <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> agents aboard. My impression, however, is
                            that the interception effort is limited and largely ineffectual. I do
                            not minimize the problems involved. Large numbers of South Vietnamese
                            fishing junks operate in the coastal waters and it is not easy to
                            separate them from one on a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> mission. A
                            successful effort would involve new equipment, trained personnel, close
                            liaison with shoreside intelligence operatives, and the like. But surely
                            this is a problem not beyond the reach of the world’s greatest naval
                            power.</p>
                        <p>2. River operations—This is closely related to 1 above. Large areas of
                            South Vietnam, particularly the southern delta region and the provinces
                            southwest of Saigon, are laced with rivers and internal waterways. The
                            sea and other water routes are used by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> for supply, transport and escape. Control over waterways
                            permits the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to extort tribute from the
                            peasants who use them or to force the farmers to use the longer and more
                            expensive overland routes to get their crops to markets.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> authorities do not have the kind of
                            equipment they need to operate against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> on the waterways. The province chief in Kien Hoa, for
                            example, told me he had one slow and rickety wooden patrol boat for this
                            purpose and that it was a “sitting duck” for small arms fire any time it
                            came within range of a shoreside <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> base.
                            He asked for one or more armored patrol craft months ago. The result to
                            date: Nothing. He knows of one fairly large <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> base in his province, but he is convinced that it would
                            be useless to attack it by land if the waterway escape route is
                            open.</p>
                        <p>This too, would seem to be an area in which ingenuity and a modest
                            investment in equipment might produce significant dividends.</p>
                        <p>3. Infiltration routes—These are fairly well established: from Thu Lu
                            across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and southward into
                            central South Vietnam; from the same area, southwest and thence along
                            the Lao-Vietnam border and into South Vietnam; through Tchepone (a major
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> base <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0334"/>in Laos), thence southeastward across Laos and into
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>; a route farther west through
                            Saravane and across the border northwest of Kontum; one from Attopeu,
                            another major base area, across the border west of Kontum. There are
                            others.</p>
                        <p>Small, special forces units should be able to carry out successful
                            ambushes along these trails. Even more promising might be quick “hit and
                            run” strikes at sub-stations along the secret trails. The stations are
                            fixed areas where <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> personnel are fed
                            and rested after each leg of their journey into the south. Given the
                            rough terrain and the quality of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> field
                            intelligence, such strikes could only be carried out successfully by
                            small, highly mobile, and rugged units capable of operating without base
                            support and in the best guerrilla tradition. Hitting the sub-stations
                            could damage the effectiveness of an infiltration trail for some time,
                            considering the difficulties of resupply in that terrain.</p>
                        <p>To be most effective, ambushes and strikes along the trails should not be
                            confined to South Viet-Nam itself but should push over into Laos and
                            possibly into Cambodia though the political problems in the latter case
                            are significant.</p>
                        <p>4. Base areas—The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operate from a number
                            of bases in Laos between the 17th parallel and the Cambodian border. A
                            few hard-hitting strikes at these bases by tough, special forces outfits
                            could disrupt or at least harass <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            operations in that area. The effect such moves would have on the
                            cease-fire and the situation within Laos itself would have to be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>5. Field intelligence—This continues to be one of the glaring weaknesses
                            of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> operations. Reports on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operations and movements come in from the
                            villages erratically and often do not reach the officials or military
                            units that could use them. I gather that the three major <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operations this month, north of Saigon
                            and in the highlands, came as complete surprises to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Authorities in the field are acutely
                            aware of this problem but I doubt that we can urge improvement in
                            intelligence operations at the village level too often or too
                            emphatically.</p>
                        <p>Related to this, there is room for vast improvement in the system by
                            which a village or hamlet under <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack
                            can inform quickly the district, provincial or military zone
                            authorities. I gather there has been an extended delay in working out
                            and supplying some form of simple alarm system.</p>
                        <p>6. Radio locators—The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> use radio
                            extensively for their contacts with regional headquarters and with the
                            North. Successful strikes at their transmitters and receivers could deal
                            a crippling blow to their communications net. I was told by several
                            Vietnamese that the locator equipment now in use defined an area far too
                            large for a successful strike. Without knowing what has been done or
                            what <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0335"/>may be contemplated in
                            this field, it would seem to be an area where effective counteraction
                            against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could be improved.</p>
                        <p>7. Air operations—This is the one field in which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> enjoys total superiority over the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. There is some question whether
                            this superiority is being exploited fully. I visited the Kontum area
                            immediately after the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks on Dakha
                            and Poko at the beginning of September. I was told that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> had been able to withdraw in good order
                            to the north to a safe area in the mountains taking with them all their
                            own wounded, a number of prisoners and stocks of captured equipment.
                            This movement sounded to me like a prime target for aerial interdiction.
                            I am not aware that there was any effective use of air strikes against
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> during the battle, which lasted
                            several days, or during their organized withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Are we making maximum use of our potential for aerial reconnaissance in
                            Viet-Nam and along the border areas? Is the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> using its limited air potential to full effectiveness?
                            How good is the system of ground-air liaison? These are some of the
                            questions that occurred to me.</p>
                        <p>8. Uniforms and equipment—Several Vietnamese officers told me that the
                            equipment they were receiving from the U.S. was not well-suited to the
                            kind of fighting that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and the
                            Civil Guard were engaged in in much of the country. This refers
                            particularly to the lowlands and delta regions. Our fatigue uniforms are
                            heavy enough in themselves; after five minutes in a paddy field or canal
                            they absorb water like a sponge and weigh the wearer down. Combat boots
                            are heavy, too, for people used to light or no footwear; in the paddies,
                            they become anchors that sink into the mud. What is needed is some kind
                            of light uniform, preferably of synthetic material that does not absorb
                            water, that dries quickly and can be kept clean with ease. Light
                            sneakers are preferred to heavy boots and some Vietnamese think no shoes
                            at all would be the best for getting through the paddies quickly. That
                            is the way the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operate, and they do
                            pretty well!</p>
                        <p>In any case, this is a matter that could be worked out in consultation
                            with the Vietnamese. In the highlands, the requirements probably would
                            be different from those in the delta. I gather the Vietnamese would
                            still like one neat uniform and shiny boots for garrison and parade-but
                            not for fighting. The easy way is to give them equipment from our
                            surplus stocks; it probably is not the best way, considering the job
                            they have to do.</p>
                        <p>I said at the outset I have no claim to expertise in the above matters.
                            This is but a collection of observations and ideas that come <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0336"/>to mind as I review my recent visit to
                            Vietnam. I hope they are of some use.</p>

                        <p>The President, in his speech to the United Nations on Monday,<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">See <ref target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note>
                            stated that: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The very simple question confronting the world community is
                                    whether measures can be devised to protect the small and the
                                    weak from such tactics. For if they are successful in Laos and
                                    South Viet Nam, the gates will be open wide.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">As I indicated to you in a conversation immediately
                            following the speech, I think that it is important that this element, as
                            well as other elements of the speech, be followed up with specific
                            action.</p>
                        <p>In this particular case, you may wish to embrace this problem within
                            contingency planning for Southeast Asia. Our planning for both an overt
                            break in the cease-fire and for continued ambiguous aggression ought to
                            consider the need for making the case against the Communists in advance
                            by forcing the international community to address itself to the problem
                            of outside intervention in Laos and VietNam.</p>
                        <p>We tend to assume, perhaps, that a break in the cease-fire would present
                            us with a nice clean-cut case for intervention. But, in view of the fact
                            that Phoumi is regularly engaged in low-level actions against the <gloss target="#t_PL2">PL</gloss>/KL forces, it seems quite possible that
                            the Communists will seize on one of these actions to break the
                            cease-fire. In such a circumstance we <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0337"/>will have difficulty convincing the world that the
                            implementation of Plan 5<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">See <ref target="#d104fn3">footnote 3, Document 104</ref>.</note> is
                            really justified. In fact, we might have great difficulty in getting the
                            British to agree to implement Plan 5 under these circumstances. We need
                            to make as much of our case against the Communists as we can in advance
                            of any such situation. To do so, we need to involve the international
                            community before the Communists act.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, in anticipation of the possibility that the Communists may
                            exploit for propaganda purposes the actions that we may take to deal
                            with indirect aggression, we need to build the case that will justify
                            those actions when they become known.</p>
                        <p>I am not prepared to suggest a detailed plan of action. But to illustrate
                            what I have in mind, actions of the following kinds might be considered: <list>

                        <p>We would have to consider carefully whether we would want to ask the
                            investigating commission to develop, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to implement, specific recommendations for dealing with
                            the problem. Our primary objective should be to justify our own

                            accomplish little, but tend to deter us from taking action we consider

                        <p>421. In course long discussion with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and party, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>, and me yesterday evening, President Diem pointed
                            the question. He asked for a bilateral defense treaty with the US. This
                            rather large and unexpected request seemed to have been dragged in by
                            the heels at the end of a far-ranging discussion, but we discovered upon
                            questioning that it was seriously intended and was put forward as result
                            of Diem’s deep fear of outcome of Laotian situation, <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>’s vulnerability to increased
                            infiltration, and his feelings that US action under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty vis-a-vis <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would be inhibited by attitudes of
                            other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> allies, especially <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France, as in case Laos.</p>
                        <p>I told President Diem that question he had raised had a number of
                            important angles, including effect upon <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, and I thought we needed to sit down together and
                            discuss all aspects very frankly and thoroughly, to which he agreed. In
                            later conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, I
                            repeated this, and he understands, I think better than Diem, some of the
                            thorny points involved.</p>
                        <p>Fuller report of our discussion with President Diem will follow.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">Despatch 158 from Saigon, October 10.

                            Purpose this message is to get quick preliminary reaction from
                            Washington on Diem’s request (which he described as a “bilateral treaty
                            like the one with Taiwan”<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">A mutual defense

                            question promptly, I think.</p>
                        <p>Our own preliminary reaction is that this request should be seriously and
                            carefully treated to prevent any feeling on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s part that US not serious in its intention to support
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>; but we see major issues
                            involved, including overriding Article 19 Geneva Accords, possible
                            ratification problems, as well as effect on <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.<note n="5" xml:id="d142fn5">In telegram 368 to
                                Saigon, October 1, the Department told Nolting that Diem could be
                                informed that his request would be studied “promptly and
                                sympathetically” but that Article 19 of the Geneva Accords was
                                certainly one of the problems to be considered. The Department also
                                told Nolting, for his own information, that it might be possible to
                                strengthen the U.S. commitment to Viet-Nam under the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> umbrella, specifically under
                                Article IV of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty.

                        <p>Diem’s frame of mind which led to this request derives evidently from his
                            feeling that policy we are pursuing in Laos will expose his flank to
                            Communist infiltration to such an extent that large-scale hostilities in
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> are predictable. He is thus
                            seeking a more binding US commitment than he now thinks he has through
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. By the same token, I think
                            a change in US policy vis-a-vis Laos, especially a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> decision to use force there if
                            necessary to protect <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and Thailand,
                            would relieve the pressure for a bilateral treaty.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">VietNam</hi>. There was a prolonged discussion of
                            whether we were taking all the possible actions, and whether the
                            existing organization was effective. Several specific measures were
                            suggested, including the expediting of junk-force action and the
                            lengthening of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> tours. On the
                            broader front, the suggestion that talking direct to the Soviets might
                            have some use was pretty unanimously rejected. The possibility of going
                            to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, if the contents of the Jorden
                            report were strong enough, was discussed as a real possibility. As far
                            as the course of developments within Viet-Nam was concerned, there was a
                            general feeling that on the present basis we were doing badly, and that
                            the outcome would be unfavorable in the absence of a major change of
                            course. (This discussion helped to trigger Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>’s proposal for <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces in VietNam, which is now
                            under urgent <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> consideration.)</p>

                                copy of this memorandum was sent by <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_SAM1">Schlesinger</persName> under cover of a memorandum of October
                                7, in which <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> wrote that
                                the memorandum had so far produced “a relatively negative reaction”
                                at the Department of State and was only a summary of his private
                                views. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> told Schlesinger
                                that unless a political settlement was worked out early enough, he
                                thought the United States might be forced to choose between “a major
                                commitment of U.S. troops, with a rapid and disadvantageous
                                escalation, or a precipitous retreat.” (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 751K.00/ 10-761) The same day <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bowles</persName> also sent a copy of the memorandum and a
                                similar covering memorandum to Adlai Stevenson, in which he wrote
                                that the general response to his proposal, “as might be assumed, was
                                a negative one, although George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell</persName> were in agreement with me.”

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> is striving with
                            great patience and skill to negotiate a settlement for “neutral and
                            independent Laos.”</p>
                        <p>Yet even if an agreement is reached on this difficult question, our
                            position throughout Southeast Asia may grow steadily more precarious
                            with a deteriorating military situation in Viet-Nam and a highly
                            volatile political position in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>We should, therefore, look beyond whatever agreements may be achieved in
                            Geneva to the broader implications of the rapidly deteriorating
                            Southeast Asia power balance.</p>
                        <p>A direct military response to increased Communist pressure has the
                            supreme disadvantage of involving our prestige and power in a remote
                            area under the most adverse circumstances. There is no reason to assume
                            that the Communists would limit their efforts to what we could contain
                            with whatever conventional forces could be spared from other areas.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we need an alternative political approach which may save us
                            from having to choose between diplomatic humiliation or a major military
                            operation,…</p>
                        <p>Let us briefly consider the existing situation.</p>
                        <p>In Viet-Nam the government position is steadily weakening. An effective
                            political base appears to be lacking and the Communists are in a
                            position rapidly to increase their military pressure with every prospect
                            for success.</p>
                        <p>As the situation in Viet-Nam deteriorates, we face the probability of a
                            sharp reorientation of Thai policy and the strong possibility of a
                            sudden switch in governments.</p>
                        <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0345"/>
                        <p>Such a development is strictly in the Thai tradition. For centuries
                            successive generations of Thais have prided themselves on their ability
                            to assure their security by skilled negotiation. Each powerful new
                            Chinese dynasty in its turn has brought pressure to bear on Thailand,
                            and on each occasion the Thais have managed to preserve their
                            sovereignty by paying some form of political tribute.</p>
                        <p>In the last part of the 19th Century and the early part of this one, the
                            Thais played the French against the British. When the Japanese attacked
                            Pearl Harbor, the Thai response was promptly to declare war on the
                            United States the following day.</p>
                        <p>In view of the power position of their Chinese neighbor, the weakness of
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, and the deteriorating
                            situation in Vietnam, it would be sheer folly to assume that history
                            will not repeat itself.</p>
                        <p>Under present circumstances an upset in Thailand would be viewed as a
                            major American defeat with grave implications both overseas and at home
                            for our position in Germany and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>In this complex situation I believe we should urgently consider what may
                            be the only feasible political alternative: to expand the concept of a
                            “neutral and independent Laos” to a proposal for an independent belt in
                            Southeast Asia to include Laos, Burma, Thailand, South Vietnam,
                            Cambodia, and Malaya. Such an arrangement might ultimately be guaranteed
                            by the U.S.S.R., Communist China, India, Japan, and the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers minus Thailand.</p>
                        <p>It may already be too late in the day to achieve agreement on a proposal
                            of this magnitude and complexity. In view of the situation in Vietnam,
                            the Vietminh and the Chinese Communists may now feel themselves strong
                            enough to reject any agreement, de jure or de facto, which does not
                            leave Laos and Viet-Nam and ultimately Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaya,
                            ripe for takeover.</p>
                        <p>However, it is not inconceivable that the Soviet Union may be prepared to
                            accept and to impose on its allies a neutral Southeast Asian belt with a
                            cease fire in Vietnam. In the absence of a stabilizing development of
                            this kind, a massive Chinese intrusion into this area is likely sooner
                            or later with the strong possibility of a major war into which the
                            Soviet Union might be drawn.</p>
                        <p>It will be argued persuasively that the Communists would simply use such
                            an arrangement as a screen behind which to maneuver a takeover of the
                            whole area from within. No one can deny this possibility.</p>
                        <p>However, if the worst occurs and the Communists should proceed with their
                            infiltration program in the face of an agreement for a neutral area, the
                            responsibility would be squarely on their shoulders. We could then take
                            whatever steps were indicated with the reasonable prospect not only of
                            United Nations, but, even more important, of Indian and Japanese
                            support.</p>
                        <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0346"/>
                        <p>Moreover, there is some comfort in the fact that Burma for the last
                            fifteen years, with a weak government, a wobbly economy, and a thousand
                            miles of border with Communist China has maintained an extraordinary
                            degree of independence while refusing to align herself with either
                            side.</p>
                        <p>The approach might be along the following lines: <list>

                                <item><p><persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> is
                                        already in touch with <persName corresp="#p_PGM1">Pushkin</persName> at Geneva on matters implicating
                                        Vietnam. He has already broached to <persName corresp="#p_PGM1">Pushkin</persName> the question of
                                        U.S.S.R. taking responsibility for preventing North Viet-Nam
                                        infiltration through Laos into South Vietnam.</p>
                                    <p>These preliminary probes should be pursued. If they seem
                                        productive, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> could be authorized, through fairly
                                        general instructions, to explore the possibility with
                                            <persName corresp="#p_PGM1">Pushkin</persName> of
                                        reaching an over-all negotiated settlement involving the
                                        entire Southeast Asian area.</p>
                                    <p>It has been suggested that the divided situation in Viet-Nam
                                        might be compared in general terms to that in Germany. We
                                        and the Soviets recognize that unification under present
                                        circumstances is not feasible. Our joint objective,
                                        therefore, should be to eliminate the fighting which could
                                        quickly spread and involve not only the United States and
                                        Viet-Nam but ultimately the U.S.S.R. and Peking.</p>
                                    <p>Under the circumstances our common interest may best be
                                        served by looking beyond not only Laos but Viet-Nam and to
                                        the possibility of a neutral and independent Southeast
                                        Asia.</p>
                                    <p>An alternative may be for you to open the subject in its
                                        broad implications in your next discussion with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> met in Washington on October 6 with

                                <item><p>As soon as our negotiations or our planning have advanced
                                        to the appropriate stage, we should begin preliminary
                                        consultation with interested governments. This will not be
                                        easy. A United States policy for an independent and neutral
                                        Southeast Asia launched without careful preparation would
                                        deeply disturb our relations with Vietnam, the Philippines,
                                        and Taiwan (although most Thais might secretly welcome it,
                                        their public protests would be vigorous).</p>
                                    <p>Yet in view of the ugly nature of the alternatives, I believe
                                        that this risk should be run, since the likely course of
                                        events under present circumstances may lead them and us into
                                        a setback with the gravest world-wide implications. If this
                                        setback should coincide with an intensification of the
                                        Berlin crisis, the impact on American public opinion and on
                                        our relations with the world would be grave indeed.</p>

                                        deteriorate too fast to permit these negotiations to be
                                        brought to a conclusion. If this occurs, a political
                                        contingency plan should be available which would enable us
                                        to move publicly for an independent neutral belt in
                                        Southeast Asia. The contingency planning should also study
                                        the ways in which the United Nations might be quickly
                                        involved if the situation begins to come apart

                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that deep
                                concern in Washington prompted him to seek <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>’s “most candid assessment”
                                of his principal colleagues, specifically whether <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> were “the right men for
                                the job” and whether they were able to “work effectively together.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also said that apart
                                from personnel matters, he would appreciate Nolting’s “most urgent
                                estimate” of the prospects in Viet-Nam and whatever “action you
                                consider essential in Viet-Nam not to succumb to Viet Cong.” (Ibid.,
                                751K00/10-56l)</note> I believe General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> is right man for the job. He
                            is vigorous, sound, forthright. He has respect of, and excellent
                            relations with, Vietnamese military officers all ranks. His credence
                            with Diem may have diminished somewhat recently because he has been
                            pushing hard for greater operational authority to military command,
                            which Diem reluctant to give. But <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> is still making headway with Diem and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. I think change in Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> at this juncture would be a mistake,
                            but suggest independent look and fresh imaginative ideas might be
                            supplied by on-spot visit and inspection (10 days to two weeks) by
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>, if
                            possible.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> extremely knowledgeable
                            this country and wide-range <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                            projects, competent, devoted. He has accepted, though somewhat
                            reluctantly, concept of “break-through programs”, although
                            temperamentally conservative and believing in long-term, self-help
                            philosophy. I think it would be mistake to make change <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> director at this critical juncture.
                            Prompt filling existing vacancies high-level <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> staff positions would, however, be most useful, as
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName>’s personal
                            supervision all aid activities poses almost impossible task. Diem,
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, and other <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials have expressed to <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0349"/>me their impatience at <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>’s slowness and rigidity. I am working
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> to try to correct
                            this insofar as blame seems to lie on US side; but <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself inclined to want the impossible
                            in expecting us to fall in immediately with plans and programs often
                            half-baked and frequently changed. Have told <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> friends this in effort develop better planning and
                            execution on their side.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> respect each other and work
                            well together, subject only to differing professional emphasis. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> wants as many troops as possible as
                            soon as possible. <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> has to foot the
                            bill in local currency. Urgency of military requirements and sound
                            economic practices necessarily conflict. <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> is urged on by his authorities, <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName> has been restrained by his. We
                            try to strike a balance and to reach prompt task force agreements.</p>
                        <p>In brief, if we do not succeed here, I do not think it will be the fault
                            of either <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName>. They understand each other
                            and work reasonably well together.</p>
                        <p>In trying to boil down essentials of what needs to be done here to
                            prevent Viet Cong take-over, I am more and more convinced, that first
                            thing is to assure that the frontier with Laos be restored to friendly
                            hands, willing and able to cooperate with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in preventing large-scale infiltrations. As indicated
                                <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 373,<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3"><ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> the
                            only way I can see that this can be accomplished is through partition of
                            Laos. I realize this presents most difficult problem to you. Up until
                            September, I thought we were on upgrade here. Due to recent
                            infiltrations, which stimulate Viet Cong internal recruitment and
                            aggressiveness, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> security forces now
                            greatly overextended. This intensifies <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> tendency to procrastinate in developing and executing
                            systematic counter-guerrilla plans, including needed rotational training
                            of troops, and stimulates Diem’s proclivity to run things on ad hoc
                            basis. Situation now seems to me thin, brittle. While no recent rumors
                            of military coup, one is likely in my judgment if infiltrations continue
                            unchecked. Potential for further infiltrations in men and materiel known
                            to exist in eastern Laos adds to apprehension of military leaders and
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Two of my closest colleagues<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">When later asked
                                who it was that he was referring to here, Nolting said that one of
                                the two was definitely <persName>Mendenhall</persName> and the other
                                was either <persName corresp="#p_AJM1">Anspacher</persName> or
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName>. When the same
                                question was put to Mendenhall, he said that <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> was likely referring to him
                                and <persName corresp="#p_GAZ1">Gardiner</persName>. (Department of

                            this country cannot attain the required unity, total national
                            dedication, and organizational efficiency necessary to win with Diem at
                            helm. This may be true. Diem does not organize well, does not delegate
                            sufficient responsibility <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0350"/>to
                            his subordinates, and does not appear to know how to cultivate
                            large-scale political support. In my judgment, he is right and sound in
                            his objectives and completely forthright with us. I think it would be a
                            mistake to seek an alternative to Diem at this time or in the
                            foreseeable future. Our present policy of all-out support to the present
                            government here is, I think, our only feasible alternative.</p>
                        <p>This carries with it, of course, the opportunity to bring about such
                            ameliorations as we can. I think we have better than 50-50 chance of
                            winning on this policy line provided the border with Laos is reasonably
                            well protected. If not, I think this government will go down, or out,
                            and that this will probably hasten a Communist takeover here.</p>

                            <item>In response to the questions posed in reference (a), the following
                                answers are provided: <list>

                                    <item>If the U.S. assisted in patrolling the South Vietnamese
                                        coastal waters at the request of the Government of South
                                        Vietnam, there would be no legal restrictions that would
                                        hinder us notwithstanding the implications of the Geneva
                                        Accord of 1954. Our case would be based on South Vietnam’s
                                        inherent right of self defense. Any measures taken at her
                                        request within her territorial waters (3 mile limit) would
                                        be justified by her sovereignty. The preponderance of
                                        traffic is carried in small boats close inshore in
                                        territorial waters under cover of darkness. If it is
                                        necessary to interdict such traffic in international waters,
                                        this can be justified under the same right of self-defense.
                                        Since this is an accepted, well established right, no
                                        undesirable precedent would be established.</item>

                                    <item>Naval patrols could effectively help to control
                                        infiltration by sea. The radar search capability of such
                                        patrols would enhance the probability of detecting boats
                                        carrying Viet Cong infiltrators from North Vietnam. The
                                        details of carrying out an air-sea barrier should be left to
                                        the unified commander. He would probably wish to augment the
                                        South Vietnamese junk force with suitable U.S.
                                        forces.</item>

                            <item>Current information from the Chief of the Military Assistance and
                                Advisory Group at Viet-Nam indicates that Viet Cong infiltration is
                                mainly overland through Laos. Since the fall of Tchepone, Communist
                                forces have had free access to the Viet-Nam border by this secure
                                and well concealed route. He believes that the sea route is not used
                                to any great extent to infiltrate military personnel or supplies but
                                may be used to introduce agents, couriers and medical supplies. <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0352"/>The bulk of the weapons,

                                standpoint, unsound. To concede the majority of northern and central
                                Laos would leave three quarters of the border of Thailand exposed
                                and thus invite an expansion of communist military action. To
                                concede southern Laos would open the flanks of both Thailand and
                                South Viet-Nam as well as expose Cambodia. Any attempt to combat

                                divisions plus supporting units. This would require an additional

                            Answers to questions raised reftel can be only extremely rough estimates
                            at best in view paucity confirmed information available:</p>
                        <p>1, 2, and 3: While armed activity has always been controlled and cadred
                            from the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, until summer 1961 perhaps
                            between 70 and 95 percent of Viet Cong forces consisted of local
                            indigenous personnel who had never been in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> for training or indoctrination. Proportion local
                            indigenous personnel always much higher in southern delta area and
                            considerably lower in highlands bordering Laos, where population thinner
                            and infiltration from <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> easier. Local
                            indigenous personnel consist of (a) Commies and Commie sympathizers left
                            in place by Viet Minh in 1954-55 when they were supposed to pull their
                            armed forces out of South Viet-Nam for regroupment to North Viet-Nam
                            under terms Geneva Accords; (b) Persons recruited by coercion through
                            pressure and terrorist tactics since <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            guerrilla campaign began to be stepped up two years ago; and (c) Those
                            recruited by persuasion during same period. Line between latter two
                            categories undoubtedly often hard to draw with respect to villagers and
                            peasants who make up bulk of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Infiltrators up to few months ago largely consisted of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> leaders and cadres. In southern areas
                            infiltrators probably mostly regrouped southerners sent back from North
                            Viet-Nam to South Viet-Nam since we have seen relatively few reports of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> with Northern Vietnamese accents.
                            In central highlands area infiltrators included both Vietnamese and
                            Montagnards, and these personnel placed into much lower levels of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> organization than political and military
                            cadres which infiltrated into southern areas. Difficult to know to what
                            extent these were persons trained in place in South Vietnam, persons
                            regrouped to north in 1954 and sent back, or persons taken out of
                            Viet-Nam more recently and trained probably in southern Laos prior to
                            their return; several reports indicate last group greatly augmented
                            since first of year.</p>
                        <p>In any case, little doubt that great bulk of infiltrators have come by
                            land rather than by sea. Infiltration of personnel by sea probably
                            restricted to couriers and individual agents.</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>During past three months or so picture given above has altered in certain
                            important respects. Greatly stepped-up infiltration into central
                            highlands and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> resistance zone delta
                            northeast of Saigon has taken place. While in southern area infiltrators
                            are still believed to be primarily individuals or small guerrilla groups
                            rather than complete regular units in manner of execution and extent of
                            coordinated attacks north of Kontum early Sept indicates these probably
                            conducted by regular <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces from
                            nearby Laos and that large-scale infiltration of possibly up to
                            battalion-size units now being carried out this area.</p>
                        <p>Conclusion about sizeable increase in infiltration is based more on
                            deductions from number, size, and nature of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attacks in central Viet-Nam and zone delta area in Sept
                            than on actual specific evidence. We are making every effort as
                            requested Dept’s 344<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">Dated September 24.
                                (Ibid., 751K.00/9-2461)</note> to come up with concrete evidence,
                            but such evidence has been hard to come by to date. One example is…
                            statement of captured infiltrator that he was accompanied by about 250
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> who descended from North Viet-Nam
                            via Laos into zone delta in July. Despite series of recent large-scale
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> actions in central Vietnam, no
                            prisoner interrogation reports of similar nature re infiltration into
                            central Viet-Nam have come to our attention so far. Evidence is likewise
                            scarce to confirm our continued belief that prisoners captured and
                            interviewed during successful <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            operations in delta in July-August claimed without exception to be local
                            indigenous personnel.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances we believe it impossible come up with any very
                            meaningful figure on number infiltrators. Feel best we can provide is
                            above qualitative analysis. Even <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            sources unable at present give reasonable estimate, though they are now
                            reportedly working on this problem.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces relied mainly until few
                            months ago on captured weapons and material from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces and crudely made arms fabricated in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-controlled areas in South Vietnam. There
                            were some reports, credible, of arms shipments from north by sea.
                            Similarly <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> depended largely upon area
                            in which they found themselves for food supplies. We believe this is
                            still true for southern Vietnam. In central highlands, however, there
                            seems little doubt that weapons and ammunition are now coming in via
                            Laos but it is impossible provide any estimate re quantity since arms
                            continue to be of American or West European origin captured during
                            Indo-China War rather than of Communist bloc manufacture. In view
                            limited food availability in highlands area we assume <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> also bringing in some food supplies from
                            Laos to support greatly increased number of personnel.</p>
                        <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0357"/>
                        <p>Infiltration of arms as well as personnel by sea continues to be
                            relatively small as far as available information indicates.</p>
                        <p>5. As one <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> source said, trying to
                            locate crossing points <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>/Laos border
                            like trying to tell which hole in a sieve water comes out of. Actually,
                            entire Laotian border open to infiltration and <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> able use all existing roads and trails not under direct
                            and continuing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> control (latter are few indeed). Use of
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, reportedly heavy several months
                            ago, probably discontinued, since route through Laos now wide open and
                            not so liable political repercussions.</p>

                        <p>471. Vietnamese have given guarded publicity to flood damage now
                            occurring on lower reaches of Mekong. In response to inquiries of
                            Economic Counsellor, Vice President <persName>Tho</persName> had
                            following to say, with proviso that for variety of reasons <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> did not wish publicize extent of flood
                            losses at this time. They appear catastrophic.</p>
                        <p>Vice President said that in provinces of Kien Tuong, Kien Phong and part
                            of An Giang, 200,000 people are now homeless. All of Kien Tuong,
                            comprising 43,000 cultivated hectares, has been “destroyed” by the
                            incursion of two to three meters of water. In Kien Phong, 50 percent of
                            cultivated area of 166,000 hectares has been lost, and in southern
                            section of An Giang, 30 percent of cultivated area of 302,000 hectares
                            has been destroyed. Road to Rach Gia from Long Xuyen is now acting as a
                            dam and preventing flooding south of that line, but just north of road
                            settlement of Caisan one has probably been completely destroyed. A
                            quarrel is now going on between those living north and south of roadway,
                            as those north of road wish it breached in order to relieve flooding in
                            their areas. This would not be a wise move according to Vice President.
                            While flood now appears to be receding Vietnamese authorities fear lunar
                            tides occurring <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0358"/>about Oct. 26,
                            as high tide from sea will then prevent recession of flood waters for a
                            few days. Losses include 300,000 tons of rice; indeterminate quantity of
                            animals, 50 people drowned; housing, possessions and clothing of 200,000
                            people. Relief goods, including clothing, medicine and the like will
                            obviously be needed on most urgent basis, and we will attempt to prepare
                            requirements as soon as possible, do what we can to help while means at
                            hand, and keep Washington fully informed.</p>

                            <item>One important question which should be discussed is the possible
                                U.S. force requirements (air and ground) if the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan 5 Plus and the South
                                Viet-Nam Plan should be implemented either singly or concurrently.
                                While a decision to plan is not a decision to implement, in all
                                logic we should have the forces available or in sight for these
                                Southeast Asia plans and, at the same time, be able to meet our
                                obligations to Berlin and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In
                                my opinion, our present military structure is not sufficient for
                                both tasks. Thus, the capital question is whether additional forces
                                should be mobilized now or the limitations of our military
                                capabilities in Southeast Asia accepted as a permanent fact.</item>

                            <p rend="center">CONCEPT FOR INTERVENTION IN VIET-NAM</p>
                            <p rend="center">General</p>
                            <p>This paper presents a concept for the introduction of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces into South VietNam,
                                under a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> umbrella if possible, in
                                an effort to arrest and hopefully to reverse the deteriorating
                                situation in that country. It is closely related to and compatible
                                with the plan for military intervention into Laos if the necessity
                                for intervention into that country should arise.</p>
                            <p>If there is continued delay in reaching a satisfactory political
                                settlement in Laos and the present ambiguous situation there
                                continues, consideration should be given to prompt implementation of
                                this plan with respect to South Viet-Nam in order to assist in
                                protecting that country from the large scale Viet Minh infiltration
                                now going on through Laos and otherwise to assist South VietNam.
                                (Enemy knowledge that a plan such as this is being considered and
                                the preliminary moves that would be made in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> also might have a favorable effect on
                                expediting a settlement in Laos.)</p>
                            <p>If there is a breakdown in the negotiations in Laos and renewal of
                                Communist offensive action there, this could be met in Laos only by
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan 5 Plus. However, it
                                would take some considerable time before that plan alone could offer
                                material protection to the borders of South VietNam. Therefore, in
                                this eventuality, the implementation of both <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan 5 Plus and this plan with
                                respect to South Viet-Nam should be undertaken.</p>
                            <p>While a satisfactory political settlement in Laos would considerably
                                reduce Viet Minh infiltration through Laos into South VietNam, it
                                would not entirely eliminate it. While such a reduction <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0363"/>would materially assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in meeting the Viet Cong threat,
                                there is no assurance that, even under these circumstances, the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will in the foreseeable
                                future be able to defeat the Viet Cong. Under these circumstances,
                                although the need of South Viet-Nam for outside assistance such as
                                proposed in this plan would probably still be very strong, it would
                                be much more difficult to find a satisfactory political base upon
                                which to implement this plan.</p>
                            <p>The visibility of this plan would be dependent upon the degree to
                                which it could and would also result in the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> accelerating political and military action in its
                                own defense. A judgment on this can only be reached after thorough
                                exploration on the spot with the country team and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>The paper also discusses a number of lesser actions that might be
                                ordered at once and that would be of some help in arresting the
                                deteriorating situation in VietNam.</p>
                            <p rend="center">The Concept</p>

                            <p>To prevent South Viet-Nam from being destroyed by Communist guerrilla

                            <p>Assuming that the situation in South Viet-Nam has deteriorated
                                seriously, due to continuing Vietminh infiltrations and harassments,
                                there are two possibilities with respect to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action: (1) Recourse to the Security Council and the
                                regular General Assembly prior to any <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> intervention with a view to seeking <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers, and failing this to at
                                least help rationalize politically a subsequent <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> move into South VietNam; and/or
                                (2) a simultaneous move in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> designed primarily to
                                justify <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> intervention.</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item><p><hi rend="italic">Recourse to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> prior to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Intervention in South

                                    <p>Diem could request the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                                        send observers with the mandate to “report the facts” and
                                        help deter by their presence further infiltrations, those
                                        from Laos and those moving south across the 17th parallel.
                                        In such circumstances, the U.S. could have the Security
                                        Council convened in the first instance. A Soviet veto in the
                                        Council is likely since, as in Laos, the USSR and Communist
                                        China can be expected to oppose supplanting the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> mechanism with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observation. Assuming a veto,
                                        the next move might be to place the item <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0364"/>on the agenda of the
                                        Sixteenth General Assembly which will be in session at least
                                        until December 20.</p>
                                    <p>Whether the required two-thirds majority could be mustered in
                                        the Assembly will depend on a number of considerations
                                        including: whether direct military intervention is imminent;
                                        how good a public case we can make documenting Communist
                                        intervention from the outside; whether the prospect of
                                        Communist takeover is immediate; and what the attitude is of
                                        key states in the area, and in particular India, Ceylon,
                                        Burma and Cambodia.</p>
                                    <p>The thrust in the General Assembly will probably be a
                                        disinclination to have the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                        intervene (the three main principals are non-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members-Communist China,
                                        South and North VietNam) in favor of an exhortation to the
                                            <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to look into the
                                        problem and perhaps the calling of a conference, as was the
                                        case in Laos.</p>

                                        be brought to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by a
                                        third party. We would be in a better position politically
                                        if, on the Lebanese pattern, we took the initiative by
                                        coupling a move by <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                                        with a move to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Our
                                        objective would be to get the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to send a small group of observers. We would
                                        adopt the public posture in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                                        need stay in South Viet-Nam only and until such time as the
                                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could deter
                                        effectively further infiltrations and help maintain the
                                        independence of South VietNam. As in the previous
                                        contingency, recourse to the General Assembly would probably
                                        prove necessary.</p>

                                White House meeting that morning the President had decided to send
                                to Viet-Nam a mission headed by General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and including <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CSJ1">Cottrell</persName>, Craig, <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName>, a <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> representative, and probably other

                                Saigon via Honolulu, spending about 2 weeks in Viet-Nam with
                                subsequent visits to Bangkok and Vientiane if the situation
                                permitted. According to <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, the mission’s task was “to review
                                situation and explore with country team, President Diem and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, as well as on the ground,

                                        telegram 478, October 12. In telegram 430 to Saigon, October
                                        13, the Department expressed regret that the circumstances
                                        of the decision precluded advance notice to Nolting, but
                                        pointed out that the Charge at the Vietnamese Embassy in
                                        Washington had been informed prior to the President’s
                                        announcement. Both telegrams are in Department of State,
                                        Central File 120.1551K/10-1261. In a note of October 12 to
                                        President Diem, Nolting offered his “personal apologies
                                        concerning the manner in which the announcement of the
                                        proposed visit of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> to Viet-Nam was handled.”
                                        Nolting explained that Washington authorities had
                                        undoubtedly “failed to take into account the time
                                        differential” in not giving him prior notification.

                        <p>I should like you to proceed shortly to Saigon for the purpose of
                            appraising the situation in South Vietnam, particularly as it concerns
                            the threat to the internal security and stability of that country. After
                            conferring with the appropriate United States and South Viet-Nam
                            authorities, I would like your views on the courses of action which our
                            government should take at this juncture to avoid a further deterioration
                            in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>As a part of your appraisal, I should like you to evaluate what could be
                            accomplished by the introduction of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> or United States forces into South Vietnam,
                            determining the role, composition and probable disposition of such
                            forces. Concurrently, you should examine the possibilities of improving
                            the effectiveness of South Vietnamese forces by additional equipment and
                            training as well as by a further increase in the size of the armed
                            forces of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>I would like to be assured that all of our United States aid, military
                            and economic, is being applied to this main problem of the internal
                            threat to South Vietnam. This aid, once approved, should flow into
                            Viet-Nam with minimum procedural delays. Having noted the long and
                            complicated chain of economic and military responsibility between
                            Washington and Saigon, I have wondered whether greater simplicity and
                            directness might not be possible. Please look into these questions and
                            let me have your comments.</p>
                        <p>I suspect that there are many unconventional forms of assistance which we
                            might bring to this situation if we apply all our initiative and
                            ingenuity. Will you see that we are not overlooking any possibilities

                        <p>This trip offers you the opportunity to observe at first hand the

                            to have his field representatives put themselves at your disposition for
                            such briefings and discussions as may be necessary.</p>

                        <p>In Saigon, you will look to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> to arrange your contacts with the South Viet-Nam
                            government and to provide you guidance on the local situation. You will
                            necessarily have to discuss with President Diem and his officials some
                            of the courses of action which we have under consideration in order to
                            elicit their views and to assure their cooperation if we take certain
                            decisions. In these contacts, it is important to emphasize that your
                            talks are exploratory and in no wise commit the United States Government
                            to subsequent action.</p>
                        <p>Although you may need to visit other places in the area before returning,
                            the Viet-Nam situation is urgent and requires priority of attention. I
                            would like you to cable me your impressions and recommendations as soon
                            as they are firm.</p>

                            Although this report gives a fair encapsulization of progress, problems
                            yet to be solved, and further objectives together with a projection of
                            our mission into the future, I feel that I should attempt to wrap up in
                            one letter for your personal information, my frank appraisal of the
                            developing situation. My feeling of concern generated by many State and
                            Task Force Viet-Nam messages from Washington of which State-Defense
                                337<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3"><ref target="#d136">Document
                                    136</ref>.</note> is a fair example appears to be growing in
                            validity. For your information, all of the members of the Country Team,
                            which is the Task Force group here in Vietnam, received the distinct
                            impression that while this State-Defense message provides welcome and
                            encouraging support, it was written primarily for high level civilian
                            consumption to cover State Department with paper in the eventuality that
                            the situation here goes from bad to worse. Also, State 269 to Saigon
                                (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>)<note n="4" xml:id="d159fn4">Not
                                found.</note> which went to all Ambassadors in this area dealt
                            largely with military <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0370"/>matters
                            was followed by obvious pressure here to get a military statement that
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> could commit significant
                            strength in Laos under coalition control. State-Defense 337 was
                            discussed at the Ambassador’s conference during Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>’s recent visit.<note n="5" xml:id="d159fn5">See <ref target="#d142">Document 142</ref>.</note>
                            It was mentioned at that time that this message in effect, points up
                            dangers in the situation here of which we were already well aware and
                            which we have previously reported from this end. It then goes on to
                            suggest a number of areas in which we may wish to take further action
                            with the statement and implication that these things should be
                            accomplished within the next thirty days if Viet-Nam were to be saved.
                            Again, these suggested items are mostly items which we have reported
                            from this end and upon which we are working and have made varying
                            degrees of progress. Indications are that State has only recently been
                            “reading their mail” and acquainting themselves with many of the details
                            on the situation here.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, I feel that for the protection of the Armed Forces of
                            the United States and specifically the Army which runs <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Vietnam, you should have my analysis
                            and appraisal of the basic causes behind the presently worsening
                            situation here. Although we are operating on the principle that we must
                            get on with the job and not worry about past mistakes, I am firmly
                            convinced that a history of these past errors is quite necessary to an
                            objective understanding of the developing situation today. This is
                            highlighted by the evident desire of State Department to gloss over or
                            forget previous basic differences of opinion between them and the
                            military, especially in this area, which have contributed so greatly to
                            the present situation and which of necessity will continue to exert a
                            significant and even controlling impact on what happens here in the
                            foreseeable future. The extent of this control will be dependent on the
                            communist timetable.</p>
                        <p>As you will recall, upon my arrival more than thirteen months ago, I
                            immediately initiated action to increase the military strength of the
                            Armed Forces of Vietnam. This was because the situation here was much
                            more critical than had been indicated to me in my briefings enroute, and
                            because it was apparent that we did not have the required sense of
                            urgency either in Washington or here. Also, because of this
                            deterioration and because it was apparent to me from a
                            political-military viewpoint that the situation had changed radically
                            since the formation of the Armed Forces of Viet-Nam in 1954, I made an
                            all out effort to take the basic steps I considered necessary for
                            improvement. President Diem had foreseen this change ahead of either the
                            Embassy or <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> here and had since 1955
                            continuously requested of our various Ambassadors and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Chiefs additional <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0371"/><gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            supported forces both regular and paramilitary. I have heard him a
                            number of times ask former Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> for a raise of 20,000 men in force ceiling. He
                            also, acting on his own, organized the Civil Guard and continued to
                            increase it to its present strength of 68,000, although initially our
                            government’s representatives here and at home refused to support it with
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> or Defense support money. He
                            stated over and over again to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> that the situation was worsening, and he did not
                            have the force with which to stop it. As you recall, I fought a losing
                            battle for my first ten months against the entire Country Team, which
                            was then being ably supported by State Department, in an attempt to
                            secure the increased force level which I considered an absolute minimum
                            for the provision of a rotational training base so that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> could be at least partially trained
                            to successfully meet the Viet Cong threat. Contrary to general opinion
                            in Washington then and apparently even now to some extent, this 20,000
                            was not primarily for the purpose of adding additional combat units for
                            commission to the hot war going on at that time and still going on with
                            increasing tempo. It was mainly for the establishment of a rotational
                            base for training mentioned previously, to strengthen a rudimentary
                            logistical system, and to give additional much needed strength to the
                            engineer support as well as a practically non-existent military
                            intelligence capability here at that time. Although I presented valid
                            military justifications to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> and the Country Team here over a period of eight
                            months after my arrival, and although the Ambassador finally admitted
                            that my arguments were sound, he merely stated that in his opinion,
                            additional force was not necessary and he would not approve it.</p>
                        <p>As you know, State dragged its feet for some months on the initial
                                Defense-<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> efforts to develop a
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan for Vietnam. Prior to State participation,
                            Defense had already issued instructions and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had developed the military portion of the
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan for Viet-Nam as well as a rudimentary
                            political-economic-psychological section as it impacted on the military.
                            When, finally, the State Department directed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> in October 1960 to write such a
                                plan,<note n="6" xml:id="d159fn6">See <ref target="frus1958-60v01#pg_604"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            completed plan was avidly seized upon as the initial Country Team
                            effort. However, after the initial flowery approval, the Country Team
                            then spent the next six weeks requiring <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to rejustify all the military facets of the military
                            section of this Counter-Insurgency Plan before they would let it go
                            forward. Then, some weeks and months later, they finally came up with
                            their comprehensive political-psychological-economic sections.</p>

                        <p>The main stumbling block on the approval by the Country Team of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s counter-insurgency section was our
                            unequivocal demand for at least an additional 20,000 addition to the
                            force basis. By State Department directive to the Ambassador here,<note n="7" xml:id="d159fn7">Transmitted in telegram 1054 to Saigon,

                            made a quid pro quo for sweeping political reforms. The end result was
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> could not
                            get what he considered adequate approval by the Vietnamese Government to
                            this overall Counter-Insurgency Plan which, of course, held up the
                            implementation of the 20,000 force increase. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> did go ahead without Counter-Insurgency Plan approval
                            on its reorganization of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and its
                            drive for a single chain of command as well as other military items
                            which were approved and implemented or gotten underway during the period
                            of the <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName>-Diem
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan negotiations in which <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> attempted to gain political concessions. When
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName> finally
                            informed President Diem of the approval on the 20,000, President Diem’s
                            reaction was cool, stating the approval only allowed him to spend his
                            own money, which he did not have. A few days after the Ambassador left
                            and before the arrival of the new Ambassador, President Diem gave his
                            approval which started the final action on the induction of the 20,000.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s
                            pronouncements on Viet-Nam as well as Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>’s visit here, not to mention
                            increasing Viet Cong pressure, made it imperative that this force
                            increase be implemented as soon as possible. However, here again we lost
                            approximately two months more trying to resolve the budgetary problems
                            incident to how much the Vietnamese Government would pay toward the
                            overall military budget. The Vietnamese Government had stated that they
                            could not finance this additional increment of 20,000 and they did not
                            start induction in earnest until after the <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> visit to Washington and after the budget committee
                            here in Viet-Nam composed of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>,<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the Country
                            Team had approved the money as a supplement to the 1961 budget. This
                            again lost more valuable time and has further set back the time when
                            these units will become effectively operational. It appears that this
                            “lead time” for induction and training which I emphasized over and over
                            again during my fight for the additional 20,000 has now been more or
                            less conveniently relegated to the background by State, with the
                            approval of the 20,000 and an additional 30,000 at President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>-President Diem level. However,
                            this is one of the primary causes which is at the base of most of our
                            current and future military problems here today. I feel this <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0373"/>salient point must be kept in mind and
                            restated periodically in discussions and correspondence affecting the
                            situation as it is developing now. Of course, the facts of life of the
                            impact of Laos was also used during the unsuccessful months of my
                            attempt to obtain the additional 20,000 increase. As we now know, our
                            military estimate on the seriousness of the Laotian situation as it
                            impacts on Viet-Nam was not overstated at that time. Personally, I feel
                            that if the communist steps up his timetable, which is well within his
                            capability, in an effort to take advantage of our weakness here before
                            these additional forces can be organized, trained and brought to bear,
                            we may well lose South Vietnam. If so, the year’s delay in agreeing to
                            increase the Vietnamese Armed Forces would be largely responsible.</p>
                        <p>The heart of the Counter-Insurgency Plan written by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> was the phased, coordinated, cohesive
                            action in the political-military-psychological-economic fields under the
                            overall direction and control of a National Plan to counter the
                            Insurgency. This plan must exploit all elements of National Power, fully
                            consider the border problem and subdivide the country into geographic
                            areas which differ for varying types and degrees of guerrilla activity.
                            This subdivision is based on the availability of food, terrain and
                            characteristics of the population. The concept of operations cannot
                            consist of a series of isolated, uncoordinated skirmishes and
                            pacification measures cannot be applied uniformly in all parts of the
                            country simultaneously because of the prohibitive number of troops this
                            would require. Rather, the concept visualized on a pre-planned basis,
                            the progressive pacification of selected areas. Further, it must be
                            recognized that to drive the guerrilla force from a particular area is
                            only the beginning. The guerrilla “sub surface” or political structure
                            must then be eliminated, and replaced with a viable governmental
                            structure which will rally the population to National objectives. This
                            plan has not yet been written much less implemented. I feel this is
                            currently one of the most important problems which must be solved and
                            that this problem is now basically political as our significant military
                            progress cannot be fully effective until this political progress is
                            made. This is because of the absolute requirement for gaining and
                            maintaining trust and confidence in the established government,
                            particularly at village and hamlet level. Best estimates at present
                            indicate that 25% of the population actively assist the Viet Cong, while
                            another 25 % are sitting on the fence. Military, politico-economic and
                            psychological plans-however fully coordinated at National and Regional
                            level-are meaningless unless an integrated military-civic program is
                            developed, recognized, understood and implemented in the villages and
                            hamlets. It will require exceptionally firm and urgent pressure by our
                            Ambassador and the State Department if we are to have such a plan in
                            time. I have spoken about this <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0374"/>necessity to President Diem and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> over and over again as it impacts on the military
                            and have written a number of letters to them without success, copies of
                            which have regularly been sent to you, pointing up the need for such a
                            National Plan so that a Military Operations Plan could be made really
                            meaningful. The government has organized a National Internal Security
                            Council but it is not working to the degree that it is making a
                            meaningful contribution to the overall vital control and coordination of
                            the Counter-Insurgency Plan. The military member tells me, very
                            confidentially as it could mean his neck, that he has little say in the
                            operations of this group on military matters-that he merely goes to be
                            told what to do. This apparently is true in varied degrees for the other
                            agencies of the government also. The end result of this failure to
                            develop a National Plan is disjointed and unconnected governmental
                            actions in the overall counter-insurgency field. These uncoordinated,
                            uncontrolled actions make it very difficult for the military to function
                            effectively in the military phase of this counter-insurgency effort.
                            Consequently, they are mostly reacting to Viet Cong threats rather than
                            acting in an overall coordinated military effort.</p>
                        <p>As you know, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has been pressuring
                            and assisting the Joint General Staff and Field Command to develop a
                            Military Operations Plan for inclusion in the National Plan when that
                            plan is written. The Counter-Insurgency Plan and Tactics and Techniques

                            have been used by the Commanding General of Field Command as a basis for
                            the directives for this Operations Plan. His directives were sound and
                            have gone to the three Corps Commanders for their guidance in writing
                            their portion of the plan on a cohesive, coordinated, countrywide basis.
                            He has received and returned their plans for additional refinement
                            together with his additional guidance. It will probably take some two or
                            three months before the final Military Operations Plan will be
                            completed. Although this is not preventing a more coordinated purely
                            military approach to the overall problem in so far as possible-it is
                            slowing it down. In addition, I am convinced that until a meaningful
                            valid National Plan is produced into which the Military Operations Plan
                            can be integrated, the overall military operation in Viet-Nam cannot be
                            adequately carried out with any certainty of success. At present, our
                            problems are in the area of a firm control and coordinating framework
                            under the National Internal Security Council extending down through
                            subordinate councils or <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0375"/>committees at the district, village and hamlet levels. This lack of an
                            adequate framework, together with the chaotic, uncoordinated state of
                            the intelligence effort in this country, will continue to handicap the
                            operations of the military. Although a central intelligence organization
                            has been set up, Colonel Y who is in charge is little more than an
                            office boy, working on mostly inconsequential problems, rather than a
                            director and a coordinator. He is being undercut by other civil
                            intelligence agencies who do not wish to lose their power. It is
                            problematic if President Diem intends to really build up a strong
                            central intelligence office as he appears sensitive to the concentration
                            of power in any one agency. On the military side, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has brought in mobile intelligence
                            training teams and has revamped the intelligence school system here to
                            make it more responsive militarily to field work against the Viet Cong.
                            However, with the lack of cooperation and coordination by the Province
                            Chiefs, who collect intelligence at hamlet and village level and do not
                            adequately inform the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, this
                            improvement in military intelligence cannot be meaningful. Here again is
                            an area in which our Ambassador and the State Department must take
                            necessary strong, positive and early action to insure that we do have an
                            integrated and coordinated national intelligence effort here controlled
                            at national level and reaching down to, and up from, the grass roots
                            “hamlet” level.</p>
                        <p>I was concerned when State Department directed the Task Force group here
                            to develop a phased Pacification Plan on a dateline basis.<note n="9" xml:id="d159fn9">Not further identified.</note> We most certainly
                            agree and have been working for a phased, coordinated, cohesive,
                            geographical plan for clearing the entire country of the communist
                            guerrilla under an overall National Plan. However, it is impossible to
                            get such a pacification plan developed unless we can get an overall
                            National Plan developed first. Even then, it will be impossible to give
                            State Department the phased plan with dates for completion of successive
                            portions of that plan for which they continue to press. I understand
                            second hand that Doctor <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                            and Ben Woods [Wood] are still pushing for this timetable of conquest in
                            the clearance effort here in Vietnam. As previously stated, our
                            recommendations to the government and to the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> have pointed up the need for such a plan, without,
                            however, the unrealistic timetable control. We feel this timetable
                            approach to be highly questionable because of the advanced state of the
                            insurgency and because of the lack of adequate forces to counter it.
                            Although the plan must be geographically phased on the amoeba principle
                            starting with the clearance of various key areas and expanding these <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0376"/>areas until the entire country
                            is covered, we do not feel it should or could be prepared on a
                            mechanical timetable basis.</p>
                        <p>The victories which were won by the 7th and 5th Divisions of the III
                            Corps in the Plaine des Joncs and Delta area in July, August and part of
                            September were heartening to us all. However, these victories must be
                            placed in proper context as they apparently have whetted the appetite of
                            our people back home for additional continuing and successive victories.
                            It is being intimated that we should follow through to complete victory
                            now that we have the Viet Cong on the run. This is in spite of the fact
                            that since 1 September, particularly in the Dak Ha-Pleikodil areas north
                            of Kontum, we started meeting not territorial Viet Cong but regular Viet
                            Cong units in larger numbers of from 500 to 1,500, and these larger Viet
                            Cong units have been gaining successes of their own. I was asked by the
                            Country Team “how could this happen after our victories!” I explained
                            the military facts of life to them but am sure it has not gotten through
                            to their top sides. Basically, the fact is that the operations in the
                            Delta area which were successful were pre-planned set-piece operations.
                            Plenty of time was given to their planning and moving into position and
                            tactical surprise together with superiority of force was gained. Even
                            though the planning, movement to contact and actual operations were
                            surprisingly well done, errors were committed which could have caused
                            failure. In these operations, the Viet Cong in some instances were
                            either cooperative enough or forced by encirclement to stand and fight
                            in larger groups against stiff opposition-which is not their tactic. The
                            reorganization of the Armed Forces with the single chain of command and
                            the progress we have made in our training over the past ten months in
                            developing joint operations gave these divisions the capability to fight
                            the set-piece battle-not the approved strength increase which is not yet
                            inducted and trained. However, the battles up north against larger,
                            better equipped, better trained, more conventional type Viet Cong units
                            coming in from across the Laotian border have been significantly
                            different. There, we have been hit by superior numbers who have taken
                            the initiative, gained surprise and won. Due to the state of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> training, follow-up action has not
                            been quick or well coordinated enough to gain decisive results although
                            action of this type has, at times, inflicted comparable casualties on
                            the Viet Cong. We have not yet had the opportunity to train the Armed
                            Forces of Viet-Nam to the degree that they can react to a sizable
                            surprise attack effectively and efficiently. The training which has been
                            given here over the past year has of necessity been a “boot strap”
                            operation by various <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units with
                            approximately 75% to 80% of the entire <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> regularly committed against the communist guerrilla.
                            This leaves little if any time for badly needed training on a
                            pre-planned <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0377"/>basis. This is the
                            result again of not having adequate strength to both train and fight and
                            it will be some time in the future, months and probably over a year,
                            until this can be done to the required degree. And, it can only be done
                            then if the communists do not continue the significant increase of
                            infiltration of guerrillas into South Viet-Nam across porous borders
                            which has been going on to my knowledge for the past year. In this
                            respect, I feel it is necessary to keep in mind and to convince our
                            civil opposite numbers in Washington by constant reiteration that the
                            military situation thirteen months ago was critical and that we were
                            only containing the emergency at that time. The build up of additional
                            strength in the 20,000 and the 30,000 increments were for the purpose of
                            providing a rotational training base and liquidating the insurgency, and
                            were predicated on the stated assumption that the communists would not
                            significantly increase their guerrilla strength in South Vietnam. Since
                            the first of the year, this strength has risen from approximately 10,000
                            to 17,000 with 4,000 of that increase in the past four months. So, again
                            the situation has changed significantly, a fact apparently not fully
                            realized or adequately taken into consideration by Washington civilians.
                            I feel it quite illogical to expect that this long delayed, insufficient
                            and not yet organized or trained additional increment of strength can be
                            expected to account for impressive victories “which should be extended
                            and capitalized upon.” Time, which was thrown away four years ago and
                            even as late as thirteen months ago cannot be recaptured. It cannot be
                            provided under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and delivered with
                            the beans and bullets to the soldiers on the battlefield. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is making every possible effort to
                            speed up the training, keep pressure on for more rapid induction and to
                            develop additional badly needed leadership-not to mention the urgent
                            development of an all important National Plan. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommendations for large scale <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> effort against sizable Viet Cong
                            build up in <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> and along the I-II
                            Corps boundaries have received approval and planning started last week.
                            Properly supported, these look hopeful if done soon enough.</p>
                        <p>Another area which concerns me and which will no doubt have its impact to
                            a greater and greater degree as the Viet Cong pressure mounts against
                            the Armed Forces here is the force structure and capability of the
                            regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops. As you recall,
                            State Department was insistent at the time of my arrival that the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> was too conventionally organized and
                            operated. This was never so to the degree that they claimed and most
                            certainly for the past year it has not been valid. Not only Rangers but
                            all <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops have received Ranger
                            oriented training to the full extent allowed by hot war operations here.
                            In figuring the force basis for the 20,000, State insisted on a great
                            number of Ranger companies. We resisted this, <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0378"/>fought a losing battle and finally
                            settled for 21 Ranger companies. This was in addition to the 64 Ranger
                            companies already in being which, if properly used, were considered
                            militarily adequate by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> at that
                            time. In order to activate these additional 21 Ranger companies,
                            President Diem and the Joint General Staff, contrary to my
                            recommendations, have been cadring all of the required leadership and
                            enlisted strength from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units. They
                            claim that this is the only way they can develop these Ranger companies
                            quickly enough in view of the “worsening” situation. This approach is
                            proving counterproductive. After continued strong representation, I have
                            finally succeeded in getting this system changed so that only 50 % of
                            the leadership and men are taken from the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units. However, I feel serious damage has been done to
                            the capability of the divisional units which have been cadred for this
                            purpose. For instance, the 5th Division is now only at 58/yo strength.
                            In addition to this, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> is
                            now insisting that we form four more airborne battalions from the
                            additional 20,000 troop ceiling for use in the strategic reserve. As you
                            recall, no airborne battalions were programmed in the 20,000. However,
                            one was programmed for the additional 30,000 and three more if we go up
                            to the 273,000. Although not fully supported by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            demands all four battalions now, with the implication that we will lose
                            the war if we do not allow this! In this respect, since the arrival of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> Group, who were
                            preceded here by Mr. “Dato” Fenner, Police Commissioner in Malaya for

                            shortcomings on American non-support to an increasing degree. I have
                            agreed to the formation of one more airborne battalion which gives two
                            regimental airborne groups. As only one battalion can be lifted by the
                            airlift we have here at present and as 50 % of the country is impossible
                            for paradrop, I feel this is more than adequate. These battalions, if
                            they are forced upon us, will also be cadred from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units which will further water down
                            the current five airborne battalions as well as divisional capability
                            past the point of no return and seriously unbalance the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> force structure. Even the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Airborne Commander is “discreetly”
                            concerned over this quantity vs quality approach. Frankly, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> appears to feel they can get anything
                            they want, regardless of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            recommendations by going through the Ambassador to top American levels.
                            What we need to <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0379"/>win is National
                            control and coordination of effort, not just hardware! I have alerted
                            the Ambassador on this need and discussed it with him at some length. At
                            present, he apparently agrees with me that we must present a united
                            front but appears to be moving slowly on the problem.</p>

                        <p>I have told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and the top
                            commanders here that in my professional opinion, they have watered down
                            the capability of the regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            divisions beyond the danger point and I have strongly recommended that
                            raiding these outfits to form special forces stop. The civilian top side
                            here insists that this is the only way they can quickly build the
                            military units with the proper esprit. In this respect, as you will
                            recall, I have written letters to both President Diem and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> stating that units trained as
                            Rangers are being used improperly on static guard duty and as Province
                            Chiefs’ body guards. A recent <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            study shows a developing morale problem in the Ranger companies due to
                            this misuse and poor support. I have also pointed out that the airborne
                            units and the marine units in the strategic reserve are being used
                            improperly which is breaking up their tactical integrity and
                            cohesiveness as fighting units. This is also beginning to affect their
                            morale. These small so-called elite groups lend themselves to misuse by
                            the President through the Province Chiefs or by directive to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> as they are tailored in nice
                            convenient packages. I have pointed this out in my attempts to convince
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that it would be unwise
                            to form more airborne units. However, “airborne” has a magic connotation
                            here and he is continuing to push for this. Actually, the facts of life
                            for some time to come will be their continued use as regular infantry or
                            truck transported units because of lack of airlift, airfields and large
                            areas of operations. I cannot in good faith from my professional
                            experience agree with the formation of new special units at the expense
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> when it lowers the overall
                            fighting capability of the entire armed forces. I do not believe the
                            “psychological lift” claimed by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            compensates for an unbalanced Force Structure. This may be taken up over
                            my head and, if so, I would appreciate your assistance. I have explained
                            this situation to the Ambassador and as of now he agrees with me.
                            However, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> pressure could change this.
                            If this continues, and if the communists continue to step up their
                            timetable as is the case at present, we will be in bad shape to meet
                            their growing conventional capability, already evidenced in the fighting
                            in the north since 1 September.</p>
                        <p>I understand that State Department is again going to push for more Ranger
                            companies in the 30,000 troop increase. In this respect, we have in the
                            approved 30,000 troop increase two divisions which are badly needed, one
                            each in the I and II Corps now being hit by the larger better equipped,
                            better trained Viet Cong units infiltrating <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0380"/>in from Laos. With the three more airborne battalions
                            being demanded, this will be impossible and we should remember that the
                            insistence on these Rangers does not emanate from here. Although this is
                            a year in the future and may sound academic now, I feel we must insist
                            on holding the line against these special type units especially as they
                            are too often being used improperly and, therefore, do not contribute to
                            the overall military posture of the country as they could and
                            should.</p>
                        <p>I have mentioned the possible step up of the communist timetable and feel
                            this could be a determining factor in holding South Vietnam. I am firmly
                            convinced that our country’s actions in Laos, Berlin and Iran will
                            determine whether or not the timetable out here is to be stepped up by
                            the communists. This is another point which I feel must be continually
                            stressed to the field marshals in the State Department who will then be
                            wondering why, with all the aid and promises of assistance which they
                            have already given us, we cannot hold South Vietnam. In this regard, at
                            a Country Team meeting today, I tabled a recommendation that we take
                            advantage of the many Washington offers of help to request that the
                            solution in Laos include assurance that the Lao border be sealed or
                            sanitized by political action-international if necessary. This is the
                            best way to help us here. Of course, I have long fought for meaningful
                            politico-military action to seal the Cambodian border without success. I
                            feel it boils down to the fact that unless these points are made crystal
                            clear over and over again in all dealings with these people in higher
                            civilian levels, the military will be blamed for a situation here which
                            is not of its own making and for which it has not been adequately
                            supported by our country. As I am jealous of the professional good name
                            of our Army, I do not wish it to be placed in the position of fighting a
                            losing battle and being charged with the loss. Of course, we will
                            continue the fight, but the ultimate battle will be won or lost as a
                            result of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> actions vis-à-vis State on
                            military matters. I know you will continue to do all in your power to
                            hold the line.</p>
                        <p>Although this is a frank objective reading from where I sit, I wish to
                            emphasize strongly that I am not overly pessimistic or defeatist.
                            Neither am I overly optimistic. I feel we still have a chance to pull
                            this one out of the fire but that that chance is getting slimmer and
                            slimmer due to the communist build up, the impact of past failures on
                            our part to allocate adequate, timely resources to this country and the
                            impact of possible future developments in Laos and elsewhere-not to
                            mention the problems involved in adequately training the troops. Also, a
                            continuing problem is the difficult job <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has without command authority of any kind whatsoever
                            to get the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take the proper
                            politico-military measures which will adequately coordinate the overall
                            counter-insurgency effort from <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0381"/>the viewpoint of required political-military-economic-psychological
                            actions. These interlocking political actions need more pressure from

                        <p>The Sec said Viet-Nam can be critical and we would like to throw in
                            resources rather than people if we can. Can we in the Depts involved if
                            the Pres directs it be done put the costs on it on a chit and go to
                            Congress in early January for the necessary special action? B said no
                            problem at all with respect to Defense. They have special authority for
                            military aid. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> no problem.
                            Contingency fund exists for State and economic aid so that should mean

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will be consulting
                            with Ambassador, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>, other members country team as appropriate,<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> on additional courses of action
                            that can immediately be taken to avoid further deterioration in South
                            Viet-Nam and eventually contain and eliminate the Viet Cong threat. He
                            will be examining possibilities of quickly improving effectiveness of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, including provision of
                            additional equipment, manned if necessary by US personnel, to extent
                            possible under civilian contract or <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> cover, as well as possible means of speeding up and
                            improving training <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces. He will
                            also explore possibility further increasing size of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces. Concurrently, he will want to
                            look into what possibly could be accomplished by introduction various
                            levels of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> or US forces into
                            South VietNam, considering role, composition, and best disposition of
                            alternative force levels, taking account of political and psychological
                            as well as military factors.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will also want to
                            examine whether all our military and economic aid is being applied to
                            main problem of internal threat in South VietNam, including its
                            non-military dimensions. He will hope to determine whether greater
                            simplicity and directness can be introduced into chain of economic and
                            military responsibility between Washington and Saigon so as to permit
                            faster reactions on our part. He will be examining all factors without
                            regard to narrow fiscal considerations, on assumption that additional
                            funding will be available if required and that funding should not
                            inhibit us from now expending what may be required to save the situation
                            as compared with incalculable costs that would result from large-scale
                            hostilities involving US forces in Southeast Asia or loss of South
                            Viet-Nam to Communists. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will hope to receive suggestions on
                            unconventional forms of assistance which might also be brought to bear
                            on this situation if we apply all our initiative and ingenuity.</p>
                        <p>With respect to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> will, in his discretion and
                            after consultation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>, <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0383"/>also
                            expect to talk with President Diem and other <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials in whatever terms it is felt are best
                            calculated to bring about those additional political and military
                            reforms which it is considered Diem can and should accomplish if present
                            and contemplated additional US assistance is to be effective. Such
                            assistance necessarily implies an even closer and more intimate
                            relationship between <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It will be important that Diem
                            recognize that increase US assistance carries with it inevitably
                            implications additionally involving US prestige, which may involve an
                            increased US voice in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> affairs.</p>
                        <p>Problems of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and Geneva accords that
                            will inevitably arise from increased US support are of course
                            recognized. Our general philosophy on this is that, while we do not seek
                            to break those accords and will as long as possible attempt to maintain
                            public posture of general compliance with them, we will not permit them
                            materially to inhibit us in doing those things which need to be
                                done.<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is flagrantly disregarding
                            accords, both with respect to Laos and South VietNam, and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> frustrated by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, its terms of reference, and attitude of Poland and
                            India in carrying out its functions. Therefore, under international law
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> clearly entitled disregard
                            accords at least up to extent they disregarded by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. Nevertheless recognize it important
                            establish public and political base for any action which is clearly and
                            publicly in contravention of accords. While <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has done much in this regard, more remains to be done.
                            Our tentative thinking is along lines of publication by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> of Jorden white paper, followed by
                            appeal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by friendly power on behalf
                            of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for observers or other such
                            action prior to action on our part that would clearly and publicly not
                            be in consonance with Geneva accords. Timing of such action will of
                            course require careful coordination and working out with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Jorden, who is traveling with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> party, is bringing
                            with him draft of white paper<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">The draft

                            members of press, it is hoped that public aspects of visit can be
                            minimized and serious working aspects maximized. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> desires that <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0384"/>purely social aspects be kept to

                        <p>369. From <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. I am much
                            gratified to learn of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>’s visit to Saigon. I trust that in addition to
                            military appraisal, some analysis of political situation can be made. In
                            my travels during past six months as well as here in Geneva, I find
                            everywhere concern over Diem’s dictatorial regime, Palace Guard, family
                            and corruption. These comments come from friendly sources, both highest
                            and lower levels, expressing view that after good early record Diem has
                            become increasingly isolated, particularly since attempted coup last
                            year. Various accounts indicate lack of confidence among military,
                            provincial government officials, intellectuals, business, professional
                            and university groups. There is general prophesy that another coup is
                            apt to happen, in which case insurgents will not be as considerate of
                            Diem as last year. The British come closer to recognizing our
                            difficulties, since they see no alternative to Diem, but even they hope
                            that increased pressures will be brought for major reforms, not alone in
                            social and economic, but in political field, particularly elimination of
                            undesirable family influence and broadening base of Diem Government.</p>
                        <p>I recognize extreme difficulties of the situation and have no
                            recommendations to make from this distance, but believe we may well be
                            sitting on powder keg that could blow up, conceivably not disastrous if
                            it was touched off by constructive forces. I recognize <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0386"/>that these are matters with which
                            everyone in Washington is familiar. I only want to add my voice to those
                            who believe more recognition must be given to political situation which
                            no amount of military assistance or participation can cure.</p>
                        <p>I hope Jorden report can be released soon as most people have little
                            comprehension of true nature Viet Minh aggression.</p>

                            the first priority is the defeat of the Viet Cong. If you do not agree,

                                        may help the enemy as well as our side, it is rather one of
                                        the net benefit. It seems to me that a guerrilla force
                                        benefits more from forest cover than an anti-guerrilla

                            be effective? Is the army’s behavior in part related to low pay (e.g.,
                            as when a soldier pays an exorbitantly low price for a chicken)? What
                            can be done about the lack of adequate provision for the dependents of

                            purposes-to buy well-drilling equipment, simple brick-making machines,

                        <p>There is an important limitation in existing <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> military directives on this subject. They apparently
                            provide that civic action may be conducted only to the extent that it

                            rule could bar all civic action in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
                            Obviously in a place like <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> where

                            civic action if, instead of submitting our own report and waiting for

                            got together with someone like General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> who has his own program and, using that program as

                            that might be explored for more general application. Our general
                            approach has been to prepare a lengthy report on a subject and submit to

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Agrarian Reform</hi>. The Washington Task Force
                            received a report some time ago that the agrarian reform program had
                            about ground to a halt.<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">Not further

                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Radio and TV</hi>. I have attached copies of the
                            memos <persName corresp="#p_WD1">Donald Wilson</persName> left with
                                us.<note n="6" xml:id="d166fn6">Not found attached to the source
                                text.</note> As I have been given the picture, past delays on the
                            radio program have been due partly to arguments between ourselves and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> over objectives and partly to
                            disagreements among the American technicians involved. Disagreement over
                            objectives has revolved primarily around Diem’s desire to have
                            sufficient power (100 <gloss target="#t_kw1">KW</gloss> or more) to
                            reach into North Viet-Nam and into other parts of Southeast Asia and our
                            desire to concentrate upon a system directed entirely toward the
                            internal communications problem. In August 1960 there was agreement with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on our concept.</p>
                        <p>There are those who believe that much better cooperation could be
                            obtained from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> if power were
                            increased. (Diem has indicated in the past that once we have the station
                            built, he will himself procure the equipment needed to increase the
                            power.) The additional cost involved is a relatively minor element.
                            Greater power would require a higher tower in Saigon which would have
                            the additional advantage of providing the kind of tower required if a TV
                            program is undertaken. However, the Country team has recently reviewed
                            this power question and concluded that we should not reopen it, but
                            should proceed with the agreed program. You may want to determine what
                            continuing importance, if any, the power question has.</p>
                        <p>Lack of progress since August 1960 is caused in part by lack of trained
                            personnel. We have never had more than two engineers in the field and
                            have relied upon inadequately qualified <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> personnel to do much of the work. When the newly
                            constructed radio tower in Hue fell to the ground because of inadequate
                            engineering the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> brought Chinese
                            technicians from Hong Kong to supervise that part of the undertaking. At
                            present there is no radio engineer in the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>/Washington is
                            having great difficulty finding one. This is primarily a Washington
                            problem, but perhaps the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> could
                            explore the possibility of bringing in Chinese or other Asian
                            engineers.</p>

                        <p>Non-project aid (commercial imports) are being used to provide some radio
                            receivers. This arrangement, however, provides very haphazard
                            distribution. The <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> Desk officer has
                            been working on a proposal to procure receivers through project aid.
                            This would permit the U.S. to subsidize purchase by picking up the
                            difference between the purchase price and a lower selling price. It
                            would also give us some control over distribution so that they would get
                            out to the villages instead of being concentrated wholly in Saigon. This
                            proposal has not yet been put to the field; you might want to explore
                            it. You might also want to explore the feasibility of Japanese aid in
                            this area.</p>
                        <p>The principal problem foreseen on TV is the problem of servicing under
                            conditions where such skills are in very short supply and where security
                            is very bad. A plan developed by Togoland to deal with this problem has
                            been, I believe, sent to Saigon as a possible model. It is, I am told, a
                            rather expensive and elaborate program.</p>

                                Diem’s fullest support is a prerequisite if the program is to be

                                        Other theater forces are capable of carrying out only

                            morning the mission received an exhaustive briefing on the situation in
                            Southeast Asia from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Harry D.
                                Felt</persName>, Commander in Chief, Pacific. Admiral Felt was
                            convinced the situation in Viet-Nam was critical and needed prompt
                            United States assistance. At the same time, he also stressed the
                            importance of getting Diem to keep his provincial governors from
                            intervening in military matters and to overcome a propensity of his
                            commanders to sit on static defensive positions. Regarding the need for
                            United States forces in South Vietnam, Felt was inclined to favor the
                            introduction of logistic units, including engineer and helicopter units
                            for selective assistance to the Vietnamese, but to withhold combat
                            forces for the time being. In the long run, he saw no answer to the
                            problem of halting infiltration short of placing sizable ground forces,
                            preferably <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> troops, in Laos

                            <item>I am, of course, aware of the political problem of creating an
                                international setting in which a substantial part of the
                                international community would regard this action as legitimate. This
                                would have to be carefully checked out; and I am only suggesting
                                that we have in hand a carefully tooled precision plan to match the
                                concept. But I believe the political and diplomatic problem is not
                                insuperable given the <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName>

                                we would not be setting out to conquer North VietNam, but only to
                                harass until it closed to communicate with supply, and infiltrate
                                its agents in the South [sic]; given the fact that this move could
                                be legitimately presented to the U.N. as a way of stopping a form of
                                international banditry which must be stopped-by the U.N. or some
                                other instrument-if we are to have a world of law.</item>

                            <item>I am also, of course, aware that the possibilities of escalation
                                would have to be carefully considered. We would have to be prepared
                                for an overt attack across the 17th parallel; a Chinese Communist
                                entrance into the war; a Soviet reaction in Berlin or elsewhere. But
                                I see nothing we can do to save South Viet-Nam and Southeast Asia
                                which does not require measuring these risks; and I think this form
                                of graduated air-naval harassment would be a real puzzler for
                                them-just as guerrilla war is for us. Moreover, there are real
                                inhibitions in Hanoi and Moscow against getting the Chinese
                                Communists into Hanoi; real inhibitions in Moscow against nuclear
                                war.</item>

                            <item>Finally, it should be clear that this kind of action would be a
                                supplement to-not a substitute for-efforts to aid Diem. It is
                                designed to produce a favorable turning point in the guerrilla war;
                                it would not end it. Therefore, the examination of how Diem’s and
                                our own resources might better be utilized must, of course, go
                                forward.</item>

                        <p>In recent requests for additional US commitments to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> Diem’s govt is acting in light of
                            present security conditions in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and
                            their estimate of increasing pressures in future. There is no evidence
                            of panic, and fact is that Diem and his govt, if they do not win out,
                            are so committed that they will have to go down fighting or be ousted by
                            coup d’etat. Recent requests for additional US help have come as result
                            calculations to bolster <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> against
                            following: evidence of increased Communist determination and accelerated
                            organization in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, the Laotian
                            situation as seen by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at present and
                            potential infiltrations, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concern
                            about a possible Korean-type attack, present size of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> armed forces and time required to
                            recruit, equip, and train additional forces, and time required to bring
                            into effect crash economic-social programs. Diem has given up, at least
                            temporarily, some of his basic philosophy on how to win struggle by
                            asking, first for a bilateral security treaty with US, and secondly and
                            perhaps alternatively for the dispatch of US combat forces (even though
                            ostensibly for guard duty, not for combat unless attacked).</p>
                        <p>Obvious first question from US point of view is whether or not world
                            balance of power is sufficiently affected by what happens in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to cause us to take measures necessary
                            to prevent loss of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to Communists. In
                            light of factors as seen from here, physical, moral, and psychological,
                            answer would appear to be clearly affirmative.</p>
                        <p>As previously reported, a major factor causing increased <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> anxiety and leading to substantial
                            additional requests of US by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in last
                            week is situation in Laos and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> view
                            that approaching solution there is going to transfer communist pressure
                            and force from that country to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Not
                            only <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, but also <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> (at least its leaders) strongly hold
                            this view. To what extent it is a factor in public morale is not yet
                            clear. This mission has already (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 373<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3"><ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> and others) submitted its
                            recommendations on this subject as it affects <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. All indications, however, point to a negotiated
                            solution <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0406"/>in Laos, eventuating
                            in a neutral govt under Souvanna Phouma. The main focus of US attention
                            and diplomatic endeavor seems now to be on how to assure strict
                            neutrality, including the prevention of the use of Laotian territory for
                            Communist aggressive purposes against Laos’ neighbors, by means of a
                            proper composition of a Laotian Govt and an international treaty. I
                            should point out in this connection that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> cannot be brought to believe (at least, I cannot bring
                            them to believe) that paper guarantees on this score, plus any <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> mechanism comprising Poland, India, and
                            Canada, will in fact protect <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>’s
                            western border. They have had similar guarantees in their own country,
                            and these have not worked. All evidence we have here points to
                            conclusion that, if the Communist strategists are willing to settle for
                            a neutral Laos at this time, it is for the purpose of concentrating
                            their attack upon <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, utilizing a
                            neutral Laos for the purpose to whatever extent proves necessary. We
                            have, however, done our best to persuade Diem and others that US policy
                            vis-à-vis Laos is not inconsistent with our determination to protect
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. We have had a certain measure
                            of success in this, although one should not assume that their failure
                            strongly to dissent, here or in Geneva, indicates consent or even
                            concurrence on the part of these people. They do not think it is polite
                            or productive to argue, but they do make up their own minds and
                            determine their own course of action on the basis of their own judgment.
                            They have made up their minds that the presently-envisioned settlement
                            [in] Laos is going to make things harder for them, and they are now
                            trying to build hedges against that.</p>
                        <p>This is major reason for their request for US reinforcements, involving
                            Diem’s breaking away, in part at least, from his long-held belief that a
                            victory over communism here, if it is to be enduring, must be achieved
                            by Vietnamese sacrifice and manpower alone. In requesting US
                            reinforcements (and thinking about inviting Chinese), he has adopted an
                            expedient which runs against his own convictions, and he is apparently
                            willing to accept the attendant diminution of his own stature as an
                            independent and self-reliant national leader.</p>
                        <p>If, then, a major cause of the deterioration in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> cannot be attacked in Laos (or the proposed remedy
                            there cannot be convincingly sold to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>), our alternative is to go all out to reinforce this
                            country internally. This would seem to involve even faster, more
                            far-reaching and more expensive measures than those now in train or in
                            prospect. The measures can, I think, be considered under two
                            headings-those designed to protect from external attack and/or
                            large-scale infiltrations, and those designed to strengthen internal
                            cohesion, to create national will and unity necessary to overcome
                            present large-scale guerrilla activity.</p>

                        <p>With any such far-reaching measures on US side, I think that we have
                            right and obligation to assure Diem takes extensive steps on his side to
                            strengthen his govt politically. These measures would relate to (a)
                            organization, (b) rallying mass support, and (c) unifying local elements
                            (i.e., educated class) in support of govt. Steps in these three areas
                            would to some extent be overlapping since improving governmental

                            description situation in VietNam, Diem gave long historic account
                            developments here. Main point which emerged concerned lack sufficient
                            number of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troops. In addition
                            insufficient armed forces he stressed need for large number well
                            equipped and trained Civil Guard and self defense corps for protection
                            of hamlets to prevent Viet Cong from feeding on countryside. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked whether increase armed
                            forces could not be stepped up. Diem and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> replied that shortage of cadres is main bottleneck
                            since additional officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>s
                            needed for all branches of security forces. Pointed to recent action
                            doubling officer trainee class at Thu Duc school.</p>
                        <p>Since Diem’s description underlined need for large security forces for
                            various defensive purposes, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> noted that offensive warfare against guerrillas
                            is less costly than defensive, and asked whether greater offensive
                            action, striking at Viet Cong bases and ambushing them on infiltration
                            trails could not be undertaken. Diem replied this being done in part but
                            many trails not known and Viet Cong find it easy to deviate past <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> units on known trails.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked for Diem’s view on
                            recent step-up in Viet Cong campaign. Diem said that Viet Cong aim is to
                            induce <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to withdraw troops from
                            southern area (where they have been more successful in recent months) to
                            meet greater activity in central VietNam, thus again giving Viet Cong
                            opportunity for greater initiative in southern area. Diem noted Viet
                            Cong now often regroup into bigger units to attack more important
                            targets but added that Viet Cong are not yet trying to engage in
                            conventional warfare by holding on to places taken.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he understood there
                            had been recent discussions of introduction of American or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces into Viet-Nam and asked why
                            change had occurred in earlier <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            attitude. Diem succinctly replied because of Laos situation. Noting it
                            will take time to build up <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces he
                            pointed to enemy’s reinforcements through infiltration <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0414"/>and increased activities in central
                            Viet-Nam and expressed belief that enemy is trying to escalate
                            proportionately to increase in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            forces so that CVN will not gain advantage. He asked specifically for
                            tactical aviation, helicopter companies, coastal patrol forces and
                            logistic support (ground transport).</p>
                        <p>Diem indicated he thought there would be no particular adverse
                            psychological effect internally from introducing American forces since
                            in his view Vietnamese people regard Communist attack on Viet-Nam as
                            international problem. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                            inquired whether internal and external political aspects such move could
                            be helped if it were shown clearly to world that this is international
                            problem. Diem gave no direct comment on this suggestion. He indicated
                            two main aspects of this problem: (1) Vietnamese people are worried
                            about absence formal commitment by US to VietNam. They fear that if
                            situation deteriorates Viet-Nam might be abandoned by US. If troops are
                            introduced without a formal commitment they can be withdrawn at any time
                            and thus formal commitment is even more important in psychological
                            sense. (2) Contingency plan should be prepared re use American forces in
                            Viet-Nam at any time this may become necessary. In this connection Diem
                            seemed to be talking about combat forces. While it was not completely
                            clear what Diem has in mind at present time he seemed to be saying that
                            he wants bilateral defense treaty and preparation of plans for use
                            American forces (whatever is appropriate) but under questioning he did
                            not repeat his earlier idea relayed to me by <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that he wanted combat forces.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> several times stressed
                            importance of overall plan-military, political, economic, psychological,
                            etc.-for dealing with guerrillas. Diem tended avoid clear response this
                            suggestion but finally indicated that he has new strategic plan of his
                            own. Since it was not very clear in spite efforts to draw him out what
                            this plan is, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked him
                            to let us have a copy in writing.</p>
                        <p>I asked Diem about significance state of emergency decree just issued
                            (our 504<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.,
                                751K.00/10-1861)</note>). He said he took this action under
                            conditions of Constitution and has sent it to National Assembly for
                            approval in 30 days as required by Constitution. If Assembly approves
                            establishment of state of emergency he said that executive decrees could
                            then be issued. I asked whether this measure was taken because of
                            security or flood conditions. He said both but it was evident that
                            security considerations were uppermost since he referred to his mention
                            of this proposed action in his October 2 National Assembly speech.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of amenities, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> told General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> that his visit to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Field Command was in the nature of a courtesy call and
                            that he hoped to speak with General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> a number of times before his departure.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">No record was found of any subsequent <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>-Minh conversations during
                                the visit.</note> He was sure that General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> was aware of the reason for his
                            trip to Vietnam-of his ambition to study the problems of the country and
                            to help find a solution to them. Speaking as one soldier to another, he
                            asked General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> for his views
                            on the guerrilla situation, how he could help to solve the problem and
                            what General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName>’s estimate of
                            the present situation was as compared with conditions which existed two
                            years ago. He told General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName>
                            that he found it hard to judge <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0418"/>and asked if, in the opinion of General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName>, the progress made by the communists was at a
                            normal rate or if he felt that the tempo had increased sharply.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> replied that, first
                            of all, he considered the visit of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to be a great honor. He knew that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had spoken with all
                            of his higher authorities and already knew much of what was happening.
                            Speaking as a soldier, he wanted General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to know that he considered the situation to be
                            extremely grave. Not only had the Viet Cong grown alarmingly, but,
                            worse, more and more, the Vietnamese Armed Forces were losing the
                            support of the population. In reply to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s question as to why he felt
                            this, General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> said that he
                            had known Viet-Nam under President Diem since 1954. The intelligence
                            provided by the population was a guide to their attitude. In 1955 and
                            1956, they were full of enthusiasm and the spirit of cooperation. Now
                            the population was giving trouble. When General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if this was because of a
                            loss of confidence and whether it was restricted to threatened areas,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> replied that the
                            attitude prevailed in all areas-Saigon, for instance, could certainly
                            not be considered to be a menaced area.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> that what he was saying
                            was important and asked him if he had any ideas as to how confidence
                            could be restored. Would success in war do it? General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> replied that the government had to
                            strive to be better understood-there should be no favorite groups or
                            classes (he invited General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to send out special teams to check). There should
                            be no distinctions of people either because of race or religion. Under
                            present conditions certain religions felt that they were less favored.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if there
                            was a clear division along religious lines. General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> replied that, although he,
                            himself, was in favor of all religions, the government conferred too
                            many favors on one and gave nothing to others.</p>
                        <p>Another situation which General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> thought needed correction was the system of
                            selecting Province Chiefs. He cited his own province as an example. One
                            Chief appointed to the province was a contractor from Hue with no
                            administrative experience. In addition, he spoke to the people in the
                            language of Hue and this antagonized them. After two years of no
                            success, another young man, from the South, was selected-a young
                            Captain, made Major for the job—whom General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> had known earlier. In the General’s opinion, it had
                            been necessary to stretch a point to make him a Corporal. In answer to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s questions,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> explained that
                            nearly all Province Chiefs were military. Most were Captains—promoted to
                            Major for the job and promoted again to Lieutenant Colonel within two
                            years. Their authority stemmed directly from the <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0419"/>President and they commanded all troops
                            in the province except those on major operations. There were, in effect,
                            two chains of command. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> had fought hard for a single chain of command
                            which had been agreed and which had worked-but only for several months.
                            Now, old habits had returned. The Province Chief was always in command
                            of the Civil Guard and of the local Self Defense Corps forces. Though
                            the Civil Guard had been officially placed under the Ministry of
                            Defense, they could not be touched by the military. When, acting on the
                            guidance of General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>, an
                            attempt was made to go on the offensive, it was found to be impossible
                            to obtain the cooperation required for the establishment of security
                            measures in areas which had been swept. There was no help from the Civil
                            Guard. General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> invited
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to talk to
                            General Don, Commanding General of I Corps, where the Civil Guard was
                            organized and employed in a special way. General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> went on to say that many things
                            needed to be changed within the Army as well as out-morale had to be
                            raised.</p>
                        <p>In reply to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            question as to whether the Presidential declaration of a State of
                            National Emergency meant that all resources of the Nation would be
                            united in the struggle against communism, General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> shrugged, agreeing that such a
                            united effort was necessary-that complete coordination of all elements
                            of the government was a must-but many changes would be needed to make
                            this a reality.</p>
                        <p>As long ago as last February, General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> had insisted that a National Plan to combat the
                            insurgency was required. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> added that he had been pushing for this ever
                            since. General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName>, with the
                            help of General <persName corresp="#p_LVK1">Kim</persName>, had been
                            working on a military plan which was just about completed. Only last
                            week, according to General <persName corresp="#p_LVK1">Kim</persName>,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> had requested that
                            plans of other agencies be made available to him for comparison and
                            coordination-he had not yet received any cooperation-and was not too
                            confident of ever getting any.</p>
                        <p>In reply to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            question as to who in the government other than the President, was
                            responsible for a united plan, General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> said that he thought that the Secretary at the
                            Presidency, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, should
                            be-but that he was faced with the same difficulties as others were.</p>
                        <p>When General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> that he should not be
                            discouraged, General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName>
                            reminded him that he (General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>) had not been faced with a war problem like that
                            in Viet-Nam and had been able to retire when he chose to do so. He was
                            not completely discouraged but he was happy to have General <persName corresp="#p_LVK1">Kim</persName> with him-they sustained each
                            other.</p>
                        <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>In answer to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            question, he said that if he had the authority to do what he wanted to
                            do, he would simply try to be impartial. To which, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> commented that one was never
                            intentionally unjust. General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> smiled and said that he understood.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> went on to say that,
                            in general, the Vietnamese do not like the Communists, but some are
                            allowed to fight them and others are not. He had fought against the Hoa
                            Hao and the Cao Dai, now these people were ready to die in the struggle
                            against the Communists. The sects no longer existed as they were before,
                            but it was hard to exterminate “what is in the head”-they persisted as
                            religions. The earlier struggle against them was really a fight to
                            exterminate a group of bandits masquerading under the name of the Hoa
                            Hao. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested
                            that the same tactics should be used against the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <p>(At this point, General <persName corresp="#p_LVK1">Kim</persName>
                            motioned that no further notes should be taken.)</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> then said that he
                            considered himself to be a young military officer in a young army. He
                            felt that the military needed prestige and leadership, and the
                            assistance of superior authorities to obtain what they needed. He felt
                            that not only was this not true-there seemed to be a desire to downgrade
                            the military.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> told General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that he was happy to
                            be able to speak to him frankly. Others would also, but only if it could
                            be tete-a-tete or in a very small group. There was a feeling that they
                            were on a plane in a dive, and that they would soon reach a point where
                            it would have to be levelled off or it would be too late.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s expression of his hope to see General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> again before his departure.</p>

                        <p>516. Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CSJ1">Cottrell</persName> called on Vice President
                                <persName>Tho</persName> October 19 accompanied by
                                <persName>Mendenhall</persName> and me. Main points made by Vice
                            President as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Intelligence services function poorly because qualified personnel,
                            equipment, and available funds spread too thinly among too many
                            competing services. Central Intelligence Organization, which was formed
                            at US request, not really functioning. Agreed with <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that adequate intelligence is
                            of first importance in fighting guerrilla war.</p>
                        <p>2. Peasants do not support Communists politically but are forced help
                            them because of pressure. Necessary to furnish proper protection to
                            peasants including development protective measures at hamlet level.
                            Stressed need for Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps, particularly
                            latter, in sufficient number, better paid, better trained and better
                            armed. Said that center is behind south in developing proper protective
                            measures at village level.</p>
                        <p>Under questioning, expressed personal view that <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> should have been
                            increased rather than Armed Forces. Added current situation in central
                            Viet-Nam requires some modification of that view but it is still valid
                            for southern VietNam. based this on fact that guerrilla war is fought at
                            village level thus requiring local forces who know terrain and people.
                            Also criticized Armed Forces for being overly-developed for modern
                            warfare rather than being able to fight in mud and water, and said
                            greater stress should be placed on Ranger forces.</p>
                        <p>3. When questioned on Montagnard problem, said this is most difficult
                            problem facing VietNam. He said that Montagnards are excellent as
                            intelligence agents but not good in combat.</p>
                        <p>4. Stated that in general economy has not gone too badly despite
                            insecurity. Asserted, however, that if Commies continue advance in
                            countryside, cities will be gradually asphyxiated through loss of
                            peasant purchasing power and growing unemployment resulting from influx
                            people into cities. Thus absolutely necessary to hold countryside. Added
                            that Communists have plan to try to seize <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0422"/>upcoming rice harvest and province chiefs have been
                            asked for ideas as to how to beat Communists to punch over this
                            crop.</p>
                        <p>5. After brief account by Vice President of tactics and techniques
                            followed by Communists in reaching present stage of guerrilla
                            development, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked what
                            should be done. Vice Pres in carefully phrased reply stated that US
                            should “intervene” quickly and intelligently. He eluded questions
                            directed at producing specific recommendations, but did state that US
                            has already given lots of arms and other aid and more will be coming,
                            and what we must insist upon is that this aid be used efficiently.
                            Pointing to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s initial
                            questions about intelligence organizations, he asserted with smile that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> already knew what was
                            wrong in VietNam.</p>
                        <p>Vice President added that morale of population is not bad and could
                            easily be revived if government worked properly. People are
                            anti-Communist and will fight but they must be convinced that what is
                            being done is intelligently planned and executed.</p>
                        <p>6. In conclusion I raised flood conditions and Vice President said that
                            urgent assistance already requested by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should arrive during first two weeks in November to
                            produce proper impact.</p>
                        <p>Comment: It was clear that Vice Pres, when pressed for his views, was
                            pointing his finger at Diem’s methods of government and administration.
                            He said he was not anti-Diem and expressed his support of President. But
                            this was a plea for US to adopt a firm approach in order to make Diem
                            and his government effective. Though lacking specifics, Vice President’s
                            appeal was both moving and disturbing in its stress on importance of
                            time. He said six months from now would be too late.</p>
                        <p>Vice President made very good impression during talk. He showed detailed
                            knowledge of what is going on in countryside, and had lucid ideas as to
                            how to deal with it. He is close to people and experienced in dealing
                            with them. Obvious, however, that he will not himself stand up to Diem
                            and doubtful that he any longer even tries to make his voice heard by
                            Diem.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked for
                            explanation of intelligence sources. Col. Bryant described how <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> field advisors receive, translate and
                            forward all <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> generated intelligence
                            reports from divisions, corps and Field Command to J2 <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>; J2 <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> also receives J2 <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> intelligence reports, estimates, studies, etc. Copies
                            of all such reports are in turn transmitted to Army Attache and
                            Evaluation Center-Attache consolidates, comments and forwards to <gloss target="#t_USARPAC1">USARPAC</gloss>, PACOM and ACSI; Evaluation
                            Center processes and produces collateral order of battle …. Within
                            limited capability <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> J2 utilizes all
                            information received to produce current staff intelligence which is
                            presented in form of weekly staff briefing of enemy situation and a
                            monthly intelligence summary. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> commented that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> not specifically charged with intelligence mission to
                            collect information on <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and must be
                            careful in this respect so as not to prejudice basic mission, however,
                            do receive information on Viet Cong and North Viet-Nam from opposite
                            numbers.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> inquired into
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> intelligence system. Col.
                            Bryant explained it is designed to operate same as US Army with flow
                            from bottom to top. However, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> also
                            has civilian security/intelligence agencies, such as <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SEPES1">SEPES</gloss>, etc., which report information through the Province
                            Chief and/or directly back to central <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0424"/>headquarters in Saigon without in many cases passing
                            the information to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> present in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> inquired as to how
                            the system should work to provide timely intelligence. It was explained
                            that there should be free and continuous exchange of information at all
                            levels between <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            battalions/regiments in provinces and the provincial administration
                            (which receives information from civil guard, <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss>, police, own intelligence net, etc). However, this is
                            not presently done in a considerable number of instances. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> commented that province chief has
                            civil guard, <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss>, own net, etc.
                            reporting information to provincial headquarters and which province
                            chief often uses solely in his own security operations, or reports to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in Saigon without disseminating
                            to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in the area. It was explained
                            that intelligence for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> military
                            operations comes from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> combat
                            intelligence efforts plus that which may or may not be obtained from
                            province administration sources.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> explained the seven
                            intelligence agencies (in contrast to US five) and stated are numerous
                            as President believes intelligence is “power” and through such
                            organizations President is able to control, and by not centralizing them
                            under a subordinate he avoids giving that power to someone who might use
                            it against the President. Agencies are the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> intelligence, military security service (controlled by
                            President and not <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>), <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss> (National Police and Security
                            Service), <gloss target="#t_SEPES1">SEPES</gloss> (Service for Social
                            and Political Studies), Presidential Liaison Service (a private security
                            service), and the recently organized Central Intelligence Organization
                            which was organized at urging of US in order to pull all intelligence
                            information together centrally, as is not now the case, where it can be
                            collated, processed, and disseminated to users. <gloss target="#t_CIO1">CIO</gloss> is having hard time in getting off the ground-lack of
                            full Presidential support, and some other intelligence agencies. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> stressed the great
                            need for timely dissemination of all available intelligence to the
                            military for effective conduct of operations.</p>
                        <p>Capability of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors to collect
                            and report enemy information and activity was discussed, and was
                            explained that under present set up advisors are unable to do little
                            other than collect enemy information from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and forward up. This is because enemy activity is so
                            numerous and widespread and advisors are seldom present on the actual
                            scene of action.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> commented that
                            reports received in Washington build up large red blots on the map which
                            continue to accumulate as no subsequent information received to up-date
                            situation allowing some units to be removed perhaps, and this possibly
                            gives a misleading and scaring picture back in Washington. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> commented <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0425"/>that very possible the red blots do not
                            build up as fast as the Viet Cong actually are building.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName>, and Major Hyler discussed Viet
                            Cong strengths compiled by Evaluation Center based on compilation of
                            collateral order of battle and special intelligence information
                            (information furnished General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> in separate report<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">Apparently a reference to eight pages of outline notes, dated
                                October 20, entitled “<persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> Briefing for Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>.” Among the subjects
                                covered in the notes were the terrain and climate in Vietnam, Viet
                                Cong strength, <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> casualties
                                and strength, actions which improve the situation in Vietnam, and
                                actions the United States might take. Under this last heading,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> said the United
                                States might “employ US combat troops to fight Viet Cong,” but they
                                should not “come in at all unless in sufficient strength to tip the
                                balance.” The minimum force recommended by <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> was two full divisions,
                                “suitably reinforced and supported with helicopters, engineers,
                                etc.” (Ibid., T-637-71)</note> and not repeated here). General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated all reports
                            going to Washington should report <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            battalion strengths (or estimates), otherwise present false picture to
                            those who think of battalions as 800-1000 man units. Growth of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military was discussed and explained that
                            available information indicates armed strength in Delta area has not
                            increased greatly, however, a consolidation and regularizing of forces
                            into regular battalions has taken place. The significant increase has
                            been in the 1st and 2nd Corps areas and indications are this has been
                            accomplished largely by infiltration.</p>
                        <p>The figure of 200,000 Vietnamese being available to Viet Cong, as stated
                            in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Aide-Memoire<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">Not further identified.</note> was discussed. It
                            was explained this figure result of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> J2 study based on information from the provinces as
                            to number of villages controlled, or heavily infiltrated by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> (cy of J2 report<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">Not found.</note> available if desired).</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> queried as to order of
                            battle picture at various echelons of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and provincial administration levels. It was explained
                            that province chief normally presents a neat picture of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> situation, but impossible for US
                            personnel to evaluate accuracy. Also, in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, the lower one goes in the units, the worse the
                            situation becomes-in the past <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> J2
                            and Field Command G2 have been quite conservative from a quantity
                            standpoint compared to subordinate divisions and slower in accepting new
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units and strengths. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> asked about interrogation of
                            prisoners. Was explained that US does not participate in this activity,
                            however, we supposedly receive results of interrogations if anything of
                            value is revealed. Prisoners captured by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> are normally interrogated at division level then
                            turned over to provincial authorities for trial, rehabilitation, etc.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> commented on lack of
                            cooperation in this and other intelligence matters from the <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss> due to antipathy <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0426"/>towards Americans of <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss> Chief, Brig Gen La-presently <gloss target="#t_OSA1">OSA</gloss> only receives, above board, a monthly
                            roundup report from <gloss target="#t_NPSS1">NPSS</gloss>, … General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> briefly commented
                            on how <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> prisoners generally handled in
                            attempt to rehabilitate them. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s
                            should be interrogated to provide evidence of link from <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> in order to make a case for the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> commented that it can be proved that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> went North in 1954-55, trained there and
                            resumed to the South.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> brought up fact of
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> build up in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and apparent little increase in Delta
                            area as opposed to Northern 1st and 2nd Corps area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> and others commented that appears
                            Nambo (Delta area) concentrated on organizing a regular force structure
                            from numerous platoon and skeleton-type units with little increase,
                            relatively speaking, in overall military strengths, whereas, Northern
                            area (1st and 2nd Corps) has seen a significant increase in military
                            elements since Fall of 1960. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> commented that it is apparent the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> opened up a second front of activity, so
                            to speak, in the Northern Highland and Coastal areas due to considerable
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> success in suppressing activity
                            in the South.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> brought up subject
                            of casualties both sides. Col Bryant stated we have no confidence in
                            reports received from <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> on their own
                            casualties, but there are indications that <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> is becoming more reliable in reporting <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualties, although still believed to be
                            inflated considerably in specific instances. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> wondered about the large <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> casualty statistics commenting it might
                            indicate low quality of recruits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> pointed out that casualties also include any
                            innocent local people who may not have actually been connected with
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, or were at least passive
                            concluding that a dead Vietnamese is always considered a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            if killed in area of action. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> queried if study of casualties versus incident
                            rate had been made-answer was no due to unreliability of statistics
                            which would be used (<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> judges that
                            all statistics are only relative and do not show the complete picture.
                            For example, a considerable amount of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            activity in areas heavily infiltrated or dominated by <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> is never reported as there are no
                            friendly sources to report.)</p>
                        <p>Types of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> (recruited in South,
                            infiltrated, etc) discussed. General consensus that some 70 percent are
                            recruited and trained in the South, approximately 25 percent are
                            regrouped Southerners sent to North after war end (or later), trained,
                            and infiltrated back to South, with some 5 percent probably originating
                            from the North and sent here as political and military cadre.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if US has
                            capability to interrogate <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            prisoners-answer was no due to language barrier, and must use <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0427"/>Vietnamese Nationals. This is
                            probably exploitable field as <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            prisoners have not been systematically interrogated in past.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked for
                            fundamental facts as to intelligence production by US in country,
                            appears no one charged with nor staffed to do this, all agencies are
                            collectors and reporters. Major Hyler described Evaluation Center
                            operation and fact that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>,
                                ARMA,<gloss target="#t_OSA1">OSA</gloss>, etc, funnelled information
                            into the Center. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            asked for mission of EC and this furnished by Major Hyler, and which
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> read.<note n="5" xml:id="d179fn5">Not further identified.</note> It was explained
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> got the
                            Center going to assist in supplying hard targets to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> based on special intelligence and
                            concealed as to source of information by use of collateral. The Center
                            reports through SSO to ACSI and Task Force. Product of Center collateral
                            order of battle effort made available to in-country and all US agencies.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> posed question as
                            to what should be done to provide efficient in-country intelligence
                            apparatus for collection, processing, and dissemination of accurate,
                            timely intelligence. Giving <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            intelligence production capability, bringing in a team from <gloss target="#t_USARPAC1">USARPAC</gloss>, straightening out <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence processes, were discussed.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> stated that <gloss target="#t_OSA1">OSA</gloss> has started on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> but President does not want his intelligence funnelled
                            through one person or agency. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has
                            and is exerting similar efforts in the military field to get MSS
                            (counterintel effort) under the army where it belongs, organize an FOI
                            capability, and train intelligence specialists. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> stated that if US units came
                            in we would want to control intelligence or at least have a strong hand
                            in the effort. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            asked for best way to set up a US intelligence production effort or
                            agency. Col. Bryant expressed belief that Evaluation Center should be
                            expanded. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> commented
                            that first we need personnel to work on the raw material, and that G2 or
                            intelligence activities must work closely with G3 or combat operations.
                            It was also generally agreed that US intelligence effort, however
                            organized, should include an organization to work hand in glove with
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> intelligence producers to
                            assure the effort is properly conducted, we receive all available
                            information, and to gain benefit of being able to exchange ideas and
                            rapidly clear up questions of doubt concerning translations, etc.</p>
                        <p>The discussion turned to plans for sealing the border in which General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> explained current
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> plans of consolidating
                            numerous isolated small posts into several large defendable border bases

                            interlocking patrols, etc. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> mentioned present capability of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to infiltrate at will through many border
                            points where there are no friendly units. <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0428"/>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            asked if important <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> groups had been
                            discovered or ambushed coming in from Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> stated yes and described several
                            instances, all of which are included in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Aide-Memoire with supporting documentary evidence. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> posed question that if
                            US should consider bringing infiltration question up in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> where should <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers be stationed to detect infiltration. General
                            consensus was that border is like a sieve and a half-dozen or so
                            locations could not effectively detect infiltration along the numerous
                            jungle trails. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            finished reading EC mission, and stated that the US wants to and must
                            know how the war is going from all aspects, and that although EC mission
                            is important, it does not go far enough.</p>
                        <p>The conference was concluded with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stating it had been most profitable. However,
                            problem remains as how to institute effective intelligence system for
                            both <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in countering the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> threat and US in order to be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Fritz</hi>: In view of the recent rumors about
                            changes at the Palace … I thought it might be useful to bring up to date
                            the memo entitled “Suggested Contingency Plan” which John Steeves sent
                            to Durby under cover of his letter of April 13, 1961.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">Neither Steeves’ letter nor the memorandum has been

                        <p>The present memorandum is intended to replace the earlier one so that you
                            will only have one file for easy (and possibly urgent) reference.
                            Naturally the suggestions which follow are subject to your comment which
                            we would very much value.</p>
                        <p>I would like to take this opportunity to tell you how pleased we are by
                            the sensible, steady and conscientious embassy which you are carrying on
                            in Saigon under the most difficult circumstances. I think the quality of
                            steadiness is particularly important in our relations with the
                            Vietnamese at this time.</p>
                        <p>Please convey my greetings to your staff and their families. I am very
                            proud of them all. If there are any personal or professional problems on

                            <p>The knowledge of the existence of this memorandum is to be restricted
                                to the smallest possible number of persons. It is not an
                                Instruction. It is designed for reference by the Chief of Mission,
                                but is not binding on him.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested that it be kept available and that it be reviewed
                                with the Department whenever considered necessary by the Chief of
                                Mission either through official informal correspondence with the
                                Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs or by telegram if
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p>The United States continues to give President Diem full support by
                                every appropriate means. For so long as Diem exercises effective
                                control over the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, the US should
                                take no action, overt or covert, which would give any encouragement
                                to his opponents. During a possible coup the American Embassy should
                                continue to support Diem fully until a decision is reached by the
                                Chief of Mission that the time for change has arrived.<note n="4" xml:id="d181fn4">Several marginal notes, apparently in

                                    sentence is written a question mark.</note></p>
                            <p>If in the best. judgment of the Chief of Mission the situation arises
                                where Diem has lost effective control, the United States should be
                                prepared to quickly support the non-Communist person or group who
                                then appears most capable of establishing effective control over the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The nature of US support in
                                such a situation should be strong enough to achieve rapid results
                                but not so blatant as to make such a person or group appear as a US
                                puppet. This will require the most careful handling.</p>
                            <p>While the final choice should not be frozen in advance, since it is
                                impossible to foresee a situation which may arise, it is believed it
                                would be wise if the Embassy prepared and kept current through <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0431"/>regular consultation with
                                the Department a list of persons and groups who might be acceptable.
                                This might save priceless time in the event of a crisis and reduce
                                the chances of mistakes or vacillation. Preliminary views follow: <list>

                                    <item>The choice should be limited to persons in Viet-Nam on the

                                        chance of rallying support in the face of the probability
                                        that the Communists would move fast.<note n="5" xml:id="d181fn5">Alongside this sentence is written “Buu

                                        appeared temporarily to have lost control.<note n="6" xml:id="d181fn6">Alongside this paragraph are written

                                        control, the first decision would be whether to support Vice

                                        having detailed knowledge and as being close to the people.
                                        It would be necessary to persuade <persName>Tho</persName>
                                        and persuade the military to support him. This might be
                                        achieved through General Duong Van Minh who is an old friend
                                        of Tho’s (they were cellmates in a French jail about 1946)
                                        and who is well thought of in the army. It would be
                                        important to hold off the President’s family. It might be

                                    <item>Meanwhile we face the very difficult problem of Diem’s
                                        leadership. Most of those close to him do not now appear to
                                        think he is sufficiently effective. Diem seems unwilling to
                                        listen to advice on this subject. The U.S. is committed to
                                        support the Government of Viet-Nam of which Diem is
                                        President. It should be assumed that any U.S. initiative to
                                        remove Diem would become known and would be resisted
                                        ferociously by Diem and his family. But if it is clear that
                                        he can no longer obtain the effective collaboration of the
                                        members of his own government, we shall have to consider
                                        what we should and can do. We presume you will have
                                        discussed this with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and that he will have your views. We
                                        will discuss this with him when he returns. In the
                                        meanwhile, in view of the reported decrease in support which
                                        Diem seems to be receiving even from his closest advisers,
                                        we would appreciate your thoughts in this regard by
                                        cable.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The best U.S. approach would thus appear to be to support Diem so
                                long as the Chief of Mission believes his control is effective and
                                to use our influence with him to make it more effective. In this
                                connection the Embassy might propose a draft of a letter from <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0433"/>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to President Diem based on
                                General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                                recommendations. Such a draft could state that in the interest of
                                the defense of Viet-Nam and of our heavy commitment there the U.S.
                                considers it essential for President Diem to create an effective
                                Internal Security Council with real executive responsibilities
                                headed by a person of stature who would be loyal to Diem and
                                respected by his colleagues. All government business would have to
                                pass through the Internal Security Council. We should also request
                                him to confirm to us the name of his successor. Other
                                recommendations could include a real unification of intelligence
                                functions. To obtain Diem’s real concurrence it would have to be
                                made clear that these moves were essential parts of the
                                Counterinsurgency Plan which Diem agreed to carry out. It would also
                                have to be implied quite understandably that if he did not, we would
                                have to reconsider our policy towards VietNam. Such a letter would
                                require a prior decision that we would be prepared if necessary to
                                run the risk of suddenly withdrawing our support from Diem and of
                                almost simultaneously throwing our weight behind the most likely
                                replacement. Such a move would require preparation, secrecy,
                                surprise, and toughness.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> invited me to visit
                            him the morning of 19 October. I did so, …. met Nhu in his office in
                            Freedom Palace.</p>
                        <p>The substance of Nhu’s remarks were:</p>
                        <p>The events in Laos have given a psychological shock to anti-Communists in
                            Asia. The governments of Thailand, Vietnam, Formosa, Korea, and the
                            Philippines have expressed disapproval of events in Laos, on a
                            government level. This may give the impression that it is only the
                            governments which are concerned, and not public <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0434"/>opinion. Just the opposite is true. The
                            Asian man-in-the-street is profoundly affected.</p>
                        <p>For example, in South Viet-Nam the Communist guerrillas now present
                            themselves in the villages as having just come from the successful
                            Communist forces in Laos. This is not true, of course, but it is very
                            effective psy war on the Vietnamese villagers.</p>
                        <p>The shock of Laos does not seem to be understood in the West. The West
                            apparently looks upon this as governmental actions to blow up the Laos
                            situation for their own ends. However, to the citizens in Asian
                            countries, the events in Laos mean the end of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and that the U.S. is now ready to abandon all
                            anti-Communists. Therefore, the Asians are becoming demoralized.</p>
                        <p>The biggest weak point of the U.S. is the lack of psychological action on
                            the world. There seems to be no unity of theme or action. The important
                            thing is to make the people know what the U.S. wants. For example,
                            during a visit to Morocco this summer, I noted an almost complete
                            absence of U.S. propaganda. The journalists in Rabat asked about the
                            meeting of the neutralists in Belgrade. After giving them some frank
                            opinions on the neutralists, the journalists commented: “You have shown
                            us the other side of the moon.”</p>
                        <p>The Free World, including the Government of Vietnam, is working against
                            Communism in an administrative fashion. This way of working doesn’t
                            create a movement of opinion. Without a movement of opinion, there can
                            be no quick action. The Government of Viet-Nam is incapable of creating
                            a great movement, even though it is doing many things.</p>
                        <p>Western propaganda against Communism doesn’t exist. Western journalism
                            often attacks the West and puts the West in the wrong. That’s why people
                            here were awaiting General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s visit, to create a psychological shock both in
                            South Viet-Nam and in North Vietnam. The visit is very important from
                            the psychological standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Public opinion in Viet-Nam has it that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s mission has the power of
                            decision, which I realize is not true. That’s why I think there should
                            be something in the communiqué about a decision. Perhaps the statement
                            could be in the form of saying: “Something needs doing in Vietnam, but I
                            am not saying just what right now. I am going back to Washington, where
                            the decision will be made.” (Comment: It was suggested that Nhu might

                            Nhu agreed.)</p>
                        <p>The Communists make use of human capital to wage their subversive war.
                            They can do all sorts of things with this human <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0435"/>capital, such as terrorism and
                            blackmail. After the Geneva Agreement in 1954, the Communists regrouped
                            people for later efforts. 60,000 were readied for Cochin China, 40,000
                            for Central Viet-Nam and the High Plateau, and 35,000 for Cambodia.
                            10,000 of the people for Cambodia were Cambodians taken to the North
                            from Cambodia itself.</p>
                        <p>The key point in Communist doctrine is the belief in eventual victory. It
                            is essential. You don’t find this in the Free World. Everybody seems
                            paralyzed by the prospect of Communist victory. Therefore, we have the
                            serious problem of stopping this decomposition. Since 1945, the Free
                            World has been thinking that it can defeat the Communists by strategic
                            solutions. We want to fight the Communists by victory. This is exactly
                            as though we were to say, “In order to win the war, you need victory.”
                            People think this is easy and this is the Western point of view.</p>
                        <p>In the Western world, we have the human capital of freedom. This is
                            something that everybody has. So, this is not only the capital, but it
                            also can be the motive for action. So, the equation is made: “To win the
                            war, you must have liberty.”</p>
                        <p>In countries not yet free, if you apply this equation to them, you are
                            going to be beaten: “To be a developed country, don’t be underdeveloped.
                            You must not let yourself be attacked by the Communists. If you are
                            attacked, you are guilty.” It is felt that liberty exists without
                            economics. Socialism has attacked capitalism on this very point.</p>
                        <p>Normally, when a house starts burning down, people help and call the
                            firemen. Now this has changed. If your house burns down, you are somehow
                            guilty. Those who come to aid you are somehow guilty, too. That’s the
                            history of Laos, and of other Asian countries. The Laotians feel they
                            are guilty. Why did they provoke the Communists by wanting to be
                            independent? Because they wanted to choose their own friends in the West
                            freely, they were attacked by the Communists.</p>
                        <p>Now the Laotians who sought liberty are being called corrupt. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and Boun Oum are labelled
                            “reactionaries”. <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                            and Kong Le are labelled “pure”. Nobody says that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna Phouma</persName> holds lots of economic
                            resources, that the bank and the airline are his. Not a single reporter
                            in the Free World seems to want to talk about that. Nobody points out
                            that Kong Le has several wives and a Chinese concubine. At the same
                            time, Western reporters say that Diem, <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, and so on, are corrupt. Why? Because they were
                            attacked by the Communists. So, in some way, they are guilty and all
                            that is needed is to look for the details of guilt.</p>
                        <p>Until now, Cambodia has been fine. However, Cambodia wouldn’t be looked
                            upon so favorably if it were realized that it can <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0436"/>be taken over by the Communists in 48
                            hours. Actually, Cambodia is not strong, is not to be counted upon.</p>
                        <p>Apparently, the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh reported to Washington a few
                            months ago that there were no Communist concentrations in Laos, that any
                            reports to this effect were Vietnamese inventions aimed at getting
                            increased U.S. aid for South Vietnam. 3 Word of this report seeped from
                            the French military experts in Cambodia who claimed to have collaborated
                            in the American report. This is the kind of false information which
                            doesn’t inform Washington properly.</p>
                        <p>In hearing of this report, the Vietnamese then asked Washington for
                            aerial reconnaissance of the Cambodian frontier.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">Not further identified.</note> This request was
                            mainly in order to be certain that Washington had the correct
                            information. The Cambodian frontier is truly fantastic as far as
                            Communist military camps go. The Vietnamese have little capability for
                            professional aerial reconnaissance. The Americans can do it so much
                            better themselves.</p>
                        <p>In order to believe a report that there are no Communists in Cambodia,
                            you would have to believe that the Communists have given up guerrilla
                            warfare. Everybody knows that one of the cardinal principles of
                            guerrilla warfare is to have bases on a border. Essentially, if the
                            Communists gave up this principle, they would have to give up Communism.
                            Communism which doesn’t expand isn’t Communism.</p>
                        <p>The Communists in South Viet-Nam are waging war in a brutal fashion. They
                            rely heavily on terror. They are applying military doctrine, not Mao Tse
                            Tung’s doctrine.</p>
                        <p>The present Communist doctrine in South Viet-Nam appears to be: the sum
                            of tactical victories establishes a favorable strategic situation. The
                            tactical actions are not political, but lead towards the hope of
                            victory. This puts the population off balance, without time enough to
                            organize itself for defense.</p>
                        <p>There is much lack of unity in Communist forces in South Vietnam. Some of
                            the Communist cadre are not in agreement with Hanoi’s policy of terror.
                            But, they can’t get out of it. They are too enmeshed in the gears of
                            Communism. Mostly, these are the people who were in the 1945-1954 war.
                            During that war, they were favored by the population, which loved them.
                            Now, due to the terror campaign, they are feared and hated. Many of the
                            prisoners, and the Communists who defect, have told this.</p>
                        <p>We Vietnamese are not applying the same doctrine of the sum of tactical
                            victories. We are looking for decisive battles. This is a real <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0437"/>mistake. We must increase the
                            number of ambushes of the Viet Cong, the tactical victories.</p>
                        <p>At a recent meeting in Ban Me Thuot, with local civilian and military
                            officials, we went over details of the local problem. Frankly, they were
                            not really waging war against the Communists there, either in civic or
                            military action. The main reason was the old one of a lack in Asians of
                            using systematic procedures. The Communists apply a Germanic system, in
                            a very methodical manner. Communism is a Western movement, applying
                            method and a thorough followthrough which really is quite foreign to
                            Asians.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese is intelligent, but lacks the methodical spirit. Each
                            takes action, but not systematically. If things don’t work, they feel
                            the reason must be elsewhere. In the two recent reverses in the High
                            Plateau, garrisons were swept away and the troops coming to their relief
                            were ambushed. The local officials admitted that they had previous
                            information of possible attack, but that the commanders and troops
                            involved were not vigilant enough. How does it happen then that nobody
                            has learned the lesson? It is because orders were poorly given.
                            (Comment: Nhu then explained the new orders that were to be given.
                            Troops going to the relief of an attacked garrison are to have the
                            primary mission of liquidating the Viet Cong ambush on the line of
                            march. Otherwise, the commander will just rush his troops to the
                            beleagured garrison in single file, be ambushed, and never get there.
                            Thus, the new orders will be: don’t say go to the rescue, but give the
                            mission as annihilate the ambush. By provoking ambushes, you can retain
                            the initiative. This can be called “drawing the tiger out of the
                            forest”.)</p>
                        <p>The military always say, “we don’t have intelligence”, to excuse
                            inaction. But, with the present system, there is exploitable
                            information. Admittedly, there is a need for more organization.
                            (Comment: Here I interposed a question about the Central Intelligence
                            Organization. I said that the Americans wanted the Vietnamese to win,
                            that we had really counted on Nhu himself to act strongly on getting
                            this <gloss target="#t_CIO1">CIO</gloss> started dynamically and
                            meaningfully. From various reports, this seemed to be going slowly.)</p>
                        <p>People put the problem the wrong way. The Intelligence cadres on the
                            higher levels have not been trained. The Americans have been helping,
                            but they trained the lower-level cadres, in large numbers. Not the
                            chiefs, though. In the old days, the French directed everything from the
                            top. Now, the Americans have promised to train the chiefs. But, the
                            chiefs have not been trained, and without trained chiefs, there is
                            nobody to direct the effort.</p>
                        <p>This is an example of accusing an underdeveloped country of being
                            underdeveloped. I am accused of many things. Probably the accusations
                            are correct, because I have to substitute for ministers in a <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0438"/>lot of matters. The communists say that
                            I take care of everything, probably so that I’ll be paralyzed by the
                            fear of being criticized. But, then, people say that I am responsible
                            for the bad things, never the good things. I’m afraid that I’ve let
                            myself become paralyzed by the fear of criticism.</p>

                            him firmly that we wanted Viet-Nam to win and that we were counting on

                        <p>It is less stable than it was six or three months ago or even than it was
                            a week ago. Major Viet Cong incidents in September and <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0439"/>October indicating serious
                            deterioration of security in Central Viet-Nam and the provinces north of
                            Saigon have revived in increasingly acute form long-standing
                            dissatisfaction with Diem’s lack of efficient organization and failure
                            to rally broad political support among the masses and the educated
                            class. The greatly increased infiltration of regular <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units through Laos and the horrible death
                            inflicted by the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> on Colonel Nam have
                            produced an atmosphere bordering on panic in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>Diem’s tenacious holding power may enable him to weather this crisis just
                            as he has survived numerous others. Three political alternatives appear
                            possible: a) a palace revolution of sorts; b) a military coup; or c)
                            Communist overthrow of the government. Chances of either of the first
                            two are about 50-50 as against Diem’s continuing essentially unchanged.
                            Direct Communist overthrow seems unlikely during the next few months at
                            least since the Communists do not yet have the military power for this
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>The palace revolution apparently now under discussion by senior <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials would aim at greater
                            efficiency in government operations and broader national unity through
                            increased use of mild anti-Communist oppositionists. Diem’s role would
                            apparently be restricted to policy questions, and execution would be
                            left to an emergency council. The group considering this has no clear
                            idea as to how to achieve its aim. This plan might well improve
                            government organization and somewhat broaden political support.</p>
                        <p>Only the military has the power to carry out a coup aimed at removing
                            Diem from power. The possibility of such a coup is proportionate to the
                            degree of success or failure in the war with Viet Cong, which in turn
                            depends on proper governmental organization and extent of political
                            support for the government. Coup mutterings are on the rise because of
                            the recent deterioration in security.</p>
                        <p>A major risk in any non-Communist coup attempt is that the Communists
                            would profit from the attendant confusion either to extend their hold in
                            the countryside to major towns or even to succeed in taking over the
                            government. Communist takeover of the government might be indirectly
                            through a weak coalition or possibly (though this is unlikely) by
                            seizing power and setting up a Communist government. There is greater
                            danger from this at present than from direct frontal Commie overthrow of
                            the Diem government since they still lack adequate forces and weapons
                            for direct assault.</p>

                        <p>Here are answers to the first of three questions<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d173">Document 173</ref>.</note>
                            you posed to me on the above subject.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">1. What unconventional warfare techniques should be
                                considered in coping with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                                insurgency?</hi></p>
                        <p>Perhaps the truest thing that could be said about the situation in
                            Viet-Nam today is that the accomplishments do not match the efforts that
                            are being made. In reviewing programs and plans, I was struck by the
                            wealth of ideas, abilities, and equipment which the U.S. has put into
                            Vietnam. Yet, the Vietnamese governmental machinery seems to be bogged
                            down, and somehow things simply don’t get done effectively enough. This
                            might well remain true despite our sending in more people, new types of
                            weapons, or changing organizational structures. Thus, just adding more
                            of many things, as we are doing at present, doesn’t appear to provide
                            the answer that we are seeking.</p>
                        <p>I suspect that too many of the people we are counting upon to get things
                            done are frustrated by red tape or by lack of real understanding of the
                            problems confronting them, with the result that they simply go through
                            the motions of their work like puppets. Mistrust, jealousy, and
                            self-seeking compound the error. Yet, the Vietnamese are an able and
                            energetic people. They don’t seem to be themselves today. They are going
                            to lose their country if some spark doesn’t make them catch fire to go
                            to work to win this war.</p>
                        <p>The spark could well be to place the right Americans into the right areas
                            of the Vietnamese government to provide operational guidance. These
                            Americans should be collaborators, who quietly advise some key
                            Vietnamese leaders on how to get things moving effectively, and are
                            physically close enough to them to permit the guidance to be constant.
                            Such work will require Americans of talent and compassion, who will
                            engage in the task with considerable empathy. Perhaps the wisest method
                            of selecting them would be to let each <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0441"/>Vietnamese name the American he would like as an
                            advisor; then the U.S. should go to work to make those people available.
                            There have been close friendships between some Americans and some
                            Vietnamese, with the Vietnamese responding warmly to the help of a
                            friend while blandly circumventing the advice of an expert who wasn’t a
                            friend. Likely, some of the Americans now in Viet-Nam would be
                            named.</p>
                        <p>This concept does not envision a large group of Americans moving into the
                            whole Vietnamese governmental structure. It is intended only for key
                            spots in the Vietnamese government, where decisive action will pay off
                            the most. Selected cabinet officers and a few Directors in some bureaus
                            should have such American advisors. The list of key posts, where
                            decisive action is needed to make the difference between winning and
                            losing, should be made by the U.S. Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The introduction of American operational advisors into key points of the
                            Vietnamese government, of course, can only be done with the help of
                            President Diem. He might find the idea attractive for several reasons.
                            It would help stabilize the political situation and cut down the
                            feelings for a coup. It would make his own decisions be more effective;
                            when he wants something done, there will be an American quietly seeing
                            to it that there is some real follow-through.</p>
                        <p>On the U.S. side, this group of Americans should be looked upon as a
                            team, structured for guidance under the Chief of Mission. While there
                            would be continual cooperation with U.S. organizations in Vietnam, the
                            team would work more effectively if it looked upon itself as a team.
                            Personnel would come from various U.S. organizations, which would have
                            to transfer them to Vietnam. The team should have a small staff for
                            administrative support. If the fiscal support of the team poses
                            unworkable problems, perhaps Presidential contingency funds would
                            provide the solution.</p>
                        <p>I believe that one year of devoted duty by such Americans would spark a
                            complete psychological change in Vietnam’s situation, give the
                            Vietnamese the hope of winning, and take the initiative away from the
                            Communists, as long as we sustain all U.S. activities at the current
                            accelerated pace. The constant, constructive help of these advisors will
                            upgrade the effectiveness of the whole U.S. assistance program.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, all U.S. organizations in Viet-Nam should move into the
                            field of operational advice, doing so as helpers, not as orderers.

                            right in with the Vietnamese Air Force to help give operational guidance
                            is another example. Most of the covert operations offer further
                            examples. Much more of this should be done, until the Vietnamese get the
                            feeling of real alliance with the U.S. and the Americans themselves
                            become personally involved in having the Vietnamese win the war.</p>
                        <p>Also at the same time, the U.S. officials in Viet-Nam should be freed of
                            as much of the present burden of red tape as possible. Entirely too much
                            time and energy is being devoted to responding to the demands for
                            information, accounting for actions, over-planning, and opinions,
                            particularly from Washington organizations. Some of this is essential.
                            If the paper work could be reduced to the bare essentials, this should
                            release much time and energy towards working more on winning the war in
                            Vietnam. Perhaps a practical device would be in having the Washington
                            Task Force visit Viet-Nam frequently enough to keep up with the
                            situation. The Task Force members know their way around Viet-Nam well
                            enough so that their visits need impose only a minimum extra effort on
                            U.S. organizations in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>There are numerous projects in the field of psychological warfare, civic
                            action, and special operations which are being done now or are being
                            developed, which I have discussed with the U.S. personnel responsible.
                            There are many imaginative operations. I believe that one which might
                            require an assist from you in Washington would be the TV proposal from
                                <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">Apparently a reference to the proposal described in <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>A second project is one with which General Milton is concerned, the
                            4400th CCTS (Jungle Jim). Serious thought should be given to making this
                            a combat force rather than an advisory group. If done overtly, it could
                            become part of the token U.S. force requested by President Diem.
                            However, it could be much more effective in accomplishing U.S.
                            objectives if we were to free it into becoming the covert unit for which
                            it was also designed. Personnel and aircraft could operate under cover
                            of the VIAT. The unit could then undertake counter-guerrilla operations
                            inside Vietnam, as well as support the 77th Tactics Brigade (the 1st
                            Observation Group) in operations in Laos and North Vietnam. Its
                            introduction now, even as an advisory group, is needed. A change in
                            mission later could be done right in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>Current plans for action against North Viet-Nam appear to be about as
                            extensive as can be made under present U.S. policy. Better intelligence
                            should start providing a further selection of targets for destruction
                            and sabotage, but it is going to take a long time and a lot of hard
                            preparatory work before the Vietnamese can do more than harassment
                            activities in North Vietnam. The new 20 kw radio transmitter at Hue
                            should be of some help when it goes into operation, but it will be a
                            weak voice compared to Radio Hanoi. (Lawrence at <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> states that it is 135 kw.)</p>
                        <p>Some economic warfare should be given serious consideration, to develop
                            unrest in the population. If debasing the currency is not feasible, then
                            measures should be taken to slow up the economy. One such measure might
                            be the seeding of the Red River with a variety of water lily that really
                            clogs up waterways and can make navigation almost impossible without
                            extensive and continuous clearing operations. If seeded near the dams in
                            the upper areas, this should have the blight gradually move down stream
                            and eventually hamper the shipment of rice from the delta region. Rice
                            production in the Red River Delta is critical to the economy of North
                            Vietnam. It now depends mostly on waterways for its transport.</p>
                        <p>Consideration should be given to a longer-range policy towards North
                            Vietnam. If the Communists can wage subversive war to capture a country,
                            then it is high time that we paid them in the same coin. Admittedly, it
                            is a long and arduous task to free a country behind the Iron or Bamboo
                            Curtain. But, if our objective was to create a situation akin to that in
                            Hungary, and then be prepared to help, with the end objective of uniting
                            Viet-Nam again under a Free Government, there would be a considerably
                            larger program to be planned for actions against North Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0444"/>
                        <p>First, however, the situation in South Viet-Nam would have to be
                            stabilized much more before it can be an effective base for operations
                            aimed at liberating North Vietnam. On the other hand, if the Vietnamese
                            thought that we were serious about freeing all of Viet-Nam from
                            Communism, our present defensive counter-measures would be greatly
                            enhanced. The Communist cadres and those supporting the regime do so
                            mainly in a belief that they are going with the wave of the future. If
                            we started actions to destroy the conviction that the Communists were
                            here to stay, a lot of the support would start weakening, including
                            support in the South.</p>
                        <p>Operations in southern Laos, by the 77th Brigade (1st Observation Corps),
                            need to be continued as currently planned. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> in Washington is now considering a request for
                            assistance in training more Vietnamese for the 77th Brigade. It is
                            possible that further teamwork … could be developed for such operations.
                            An example would be the use of Redeye weapons by Army Special Forces
                            personnel, who could accompany a 77th Brigade team to the Tchepone area
                            to knock out Soviet aircraft; selected Special Forces personnel are now
                            taking a familiarization course with this weapon, which is being
                            developed further to improve its guidance system, with the intent of
                            undertaking just such an operation as noted above.</p>

                        <p>One of the vital elements in waging war against guerrillas is to have the
                            military and the population so close to each other that the guerrillas
                            cannot enjoy popular support. Reports of the situation in Viet-Nam
                            indicate that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> continue to enjoy
                            much popular support, even though this is often obtained through
                            terrorist activities. It is a difficult task to ensure the continuing
                            “brotherhood” of the Vietnamese soldiers with Vietnamese civilians, but
                            this important command responsibility cannot be over-emphasized. The
                            U.S. Army was recently assigned executive responsibility for Civic
                            Action in Defense, and has officers in Viet-Nam who have just completed
                            an intensive study of Vietnamese civic action. It might be worth while
                            to make Viet-Nam a major test center for this Army activity, and I
                            intend to so recommend to the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The Vietnamese Army is in need of loudspeakers for tactical psychological
                            warfare. Present equipment is old and inadequate, and includes some
                            makeshift equipment I sent in from the Philippines in 1953. None are
                            available under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, since apparently
                            the U.S. has not developed a loudspeaker for tactical operations. The
                            Combat Development and Test Center is working on the problem, with a
                            prototype of a lightweight, high-powered (272 miles range) set. The set
                            is “High Power Voice Amplifier, Type DE-1492-A”, made by Electro
                            Mechanics Inc.</p>
                        <p>Major Bentz, Psywar advisor at <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>,
                            recommends that the 3 months test by CDTC be shortened and that if
                            successful, a sufficient number be obtained to equip each Psywar
                            Battalion and each Regimental G-5 section. If a Psywar Battalion is
                            organized in the Civil Guard, it should be so equipped also. 45
                            loudspeakers for the <gloss target="#t_PsyWar1">Psywar</gloss>
                            Battalions, 24 for the Regiments, and 36 for the Civil Guard.</p>
                        <p>A powerful airborne loudspeaker also is needed. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> does not have this capability at present. However, the
                            4400th CCTS (Jungle km) offers a good means for its introduction into
                            the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> inventory. I will work on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Two 17x22 presses are included in the TOE of the Vietnamese Psywar
                            Directorate. It is estimated that it will require 280 days for delivery
                            to Saigon. Major Bentz suggested that these presses might be procured
                            from U.S. Army organizational equipment, to expedite delivery, and the
                            equipment replaced in the U.S. units. I will follow through.</p>

                            and up to 500,000 personnel, mostly civilians, involved. At many towns
                            and agrovilles there is no dry land and water up to eaves of buildings.

                            October preparatory to an-0900 meeting with President Diem, I was handed
                            a paper<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Not found, but the paper’s main
                                points are outlined in <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s telegram, <ref target="#d190">Document

                            Cong activities and the recent Mekong Delta flood as basis for
                            discussions. These were not in nature of formal recommendations but as
                            time was very short, I commented on only two of the six points covered.
                            Others such as additional helicopters to improve combat mobility, better
                            intelligence by Joint Governmental action, preventing cross border
                            infiltration, and emphasizing the nature of the threat here and to the
                            world have all been covered in my correspondence with you over the past
                            14 months.</p>
                        <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>The first point was the introduction of military forces in the nature of
                            a flood relief task force for relief and rehabilitation. This would have
                            the advantage of withdrawal if desirable policy-wise after
                            reconstruction period and would contain logistic, transportation,
                            medical and combat troops. It was thought that the combat element
                            considered would be approximately a Battle Group. I stated that with the
                            known Viet Cong strength in III corps, the recent significant increase
                            in incidents and the additional Viet Cong capability for further Viet
                            Cong increase, I felt this strength inadequate especially as the
                            non-combat units will probably be scattered in approximately thirty
                            locations. When it was indicated that possibly some combat units might
                            be used in the high plateau, I stated this would further fragment U.S.
                            forces and render them vulnerable to successful attack by Viet Cong who
                            have capability with strength in-country. I said I felt adequate forces
                            must be provided to prevent this particularly since it appeared from his
                            remarks that while most of the service forces were to be deployed in III
                            CO UAAREA, possibly certain of combat forces might be used in the high
                            plateau of II corps. He said it was my job to prevent fragmentation and
                            that he would be disappointed in U.S. troops who were unable to protect
                            themselves. I reminded him that careful arrangements would have to be
                            worked out at governmental level to ensure that I had the requisite
                            control and authority over the use of U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>The above was followed by a brief discussion on the paragraph concerning
                            a Joint-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> team which would survey each
                            province to make an overall determination on what was needed to put the
                            whole house in order. This to include command arrangements
                            counterinsurgency planning, supply and equipment for all Military and
                            Para-military forces and the like. This is an extension of my previous
                            recommendation to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> following the
                            significant Viet Cong success at Vinh Binh for Joint Group to inspect
                            all static defenses countrywide. I said this was sound concept however
                            that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> should not be responsible for
                            “B” boards on <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> officers. I
                            brought this up because Diem and Thaun have, particularly following a
                            Viet Cong success, repeatedly downgraded their generals to me and this
                            would afford them the opportunity to put the onus of getting rid of
                            certain of them on <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. This would put
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in an intolerable position
                            vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> Officer Corps.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> did not answer
                            but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> agreed
                            this was valid reasoning.</p>
                        <p>At this point, discussion was terminated in order to depart for meeting
                            with Diem. When I said I would see them at palace, the Ambassador said
                            in effect they had decided to keep meeting small and only “The Four of
                            Them” would attend. I said that as American Military Advisor I
                            recommended strongly that I go as most of the <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0449"/>discussion would be about the military.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said I do not
                            agree that you should go.</p>
                        <p>I then said to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, as
                            Representative of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in Vietnam, I
                            recommend that I attend. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said this was a personal meeting with Diem and I
                            was not to go. I answered it is your decision General.</p>
                        <p>Mainly, I am particularly concerned regarding local loss of prestige in
                            eyes of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which as you know is most
                            important here. This is meant only as background for your personal
                            information</p>

                                        attacks. These circumstances coupled with the major flood
                                        disaster in the southwestern provinces have combined to
                                        create a deep and pervasive crisis of confidence and a
                                        serious loss in national morale.</item>
                                    <label>B.</label>
                                    <item>In the field, the military operations against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are ineffective because of
                                        the absence of reliable intelligence on the enemy, an
                                        unclear and unresponsive channel of command responsibility
                                        in the armed forces and the tactical immobility of the
                                            <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> ground forces. This
                                        immobility leads to a system of passive, fragmented defense
                                        conceding the initiative to the enemy and leaving him free
                                        to pick the targets of attack. The harassed population
                                        exposed to these attacks turn to the Government for better
                                        protection and the latter responds by assigning more static
                                        missions to the Army units, thus adding to their immobility.
                                        In the end, the Army is allowed neither to train nor to
                                        fight but awaits enemy attacks in relative inaction.</item>

                                        from existing Ranger Units and introduced into the difficult
                                        terrain along the Laos/ Viet-Nam frontier for attack and
                                        defense against the Viet Cong. This force should be trained
                                        and equipped for extended service on the frontier and for
                                        operations against the communications lines of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> who have infiltrated into the

                                        problem arising from flood devastation in western provinces.
                                        Its allies should offer help to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> according to their means. In the case <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0451"/>of O.S., two ways
                                        of rendering help should be considered. One is of emergency
                                        type, such as offer of US military helicopters for
                                        reconnaissance of conditions of flooded areas and for
                                        emergency delivery medical supplies and like. A more
                                        significant contribution might be a flood relief task force,
                                        largely military in composition, to work with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> over an extended period for
                                        rehabilitation of area. Such a force might contain engineer,
                                        medical, signal, and transportation elements as well as
                                        combat troops for the protection of relief operations.
                                        Obviously, such a military force would also provide U.S.
                                        military presence in Viet Nam and would constitute military
                                        reserve in case of heightened military crisis.</item>

                            <item>Diem’s reaction on all points was favorable. He expressed
                                satisfaction with idea of introducing US forces in connection with
                                flood relief activities, observing that even the opposition elements
                                in his Congress had joined with the majority in supporting need for
                                presence of US forces. In the course of the meeting, nothing was
                                formally proposed or approved but the consensus was that the points

                        <p>With regard to the critical question of introducing U.S. military forces
                            into <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>My view is that we should put in a task force consisting largely of
                            logistical troops for the purpose of participating in flood relief and
                            at the same time of providing a U.S. military presence in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> capable of assuring Diem of our readiness
                            to join him in a military showdown with the Viet Cong or Viet Minh. To
                            relate the introduction of these troops to the needs of flood relief
                            seems to me to offer considerable advantages in <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> [Vl] and abroad. It gives a specific humanitarian task
                            as the prime reason for the coming of our troops and avoids any
                            suggestion that we are taking over responsibility for the security of
                            the country. As the task is a specific one, we can extricate our troops
                            when it is done if we so desire. Alternatively, we can phase them into
                            other activities if we wish to remain longer.</p>
                        <p>The strength of the force I have in mind on the order of 6-8000 troops.
                            Its initial composition should be worked out here after study of the
                            possible requirements and conditions for its use and subsequent
                            modifications made with experience.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the logistical component, it will be necessary to include
                            some combat troops for the protection of logistical operations and the
                            defense of the area occupied by U.S. forces. Any troops coming to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> may expect to take casualties.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, this kind of task force will exercise little direct
                            influence on the campaign against the V.C. It will, however, give a much
                            needed shot in the arm to national morale, particularly if combined with
                            other actions showing that a more effective working relationship in the
                            common cause has been established between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the U.S.</p>

                                <item>Diem stressed importance of reinforcement of aviation:
                                    particularly helicopters. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and I used this opportunity to make clear
                                    to Diem that we envisaged helicopters piloted by Americans and
                                    constituting American units under American commanders which
                                    would cooperate with Vietnamese military commands. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> noted that there is no
                                    other immediate solution to helicopter problem other than to

                                    being adequately used. He stated that remedy is to improve

                            noticeable rise in Saigon’s political temperature during past week.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> visit, though
                            reassuring in some respects, has been interpreted by many persons as

                            insurgency has reached. Public funeral of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-tortured and murdered Col Nam had profound effect on
                            Saigon public. Following deterioration of general security conditions
                            over past two months cancellation October 26 National Day celebrations
                            to devote resources to flood relief and terse, dramatic declaration
                            national emergency caught an unprepared public by surprise and
                            contributed additional unsettling elements to growing atmosphere of
                            uneasiness.</p>
                        <p>Judging from conversations we have had with such persons as President
                            National Assembly, Vice President, another prominent National Assembly
                            Deputy, lawyer who is regular Governor for Southeast ASIS, former
                            Foreign Minister, etc, net effect most these developments has been
                            negative rather than positive. Flux and uncertainty now beginning
                            develop. As result there has been some scare buying and stocking.
                            Certain commodity prices such as rice and pork have again moved up.
                            (From previous 1961 average price of about 7 piasters per kilo, first
                            quality rice stood at 9.5 at beginning last week, 11.9 October 25.) This
                            in itself most unfortunate development, though flood conditions in
                            southwest probably as much a factor in it as increased insecurity.</p>

                        <p>This growing public disquietude accompanied by increasing dissatisfaction
                            with Diem’s methods of administration on part senior <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials. There is considerable
                            Cabinet level criticism and growing though still inchoate determination
                            force organizational reforms on President. Similar attitude seems be
                            developing in <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> upper levels. Though
                            trend of thinking these groups taking parallel courses, there nothing
                            indicate at this moment that collaboration between them taking place.
                            Beginnings of this would, of course, be serious indicator something
                            brewing.</p>
                        <p>At same time … movement certain platoon to company-size <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units (totalling perhaps 200-500 men)
                            toward Saigon to profit from any disturbances or confusion which may
                            occur. Knowledge these reports within <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> apparently tending deter disaffected officials from
                            developing radical place [plans?] at this moment.</p>
                        <p>Situation here thus one of insecurity, uneasiness and emergent
                            instability. A genuine and important military victory over <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> would do more than anything else to
                            redress balance and allay for moment high-level mutterings of need for

                            weeks or months or new <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> success similar
                            Phuoc Hanh incident might well bring situation to head.</p>

                            awaiting the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> report. He
                            singled out the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Helicopters in a strength adequate to provide a force for each of the
                            province governments and for the central government, i.e., 4 in <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0457"/>all. He supposed that 2 Army
                            aviation companies would be necessary to man these, and said he had no
                            judgment whether these should be in uniform or sheep-dipped. He thought
                            this item was vital in Diem’s mind and as a basic military necessity to
                            provide mobility.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> should
                            get status on this. It may be a political question, but in this
                            connection Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>
                            suggested using the flood situation as an immediate cover. This idea
                            should certainly be followed up strongly.</p>
                        <p>b. An Army engineer and a Navy Seabee unit. These could build a pipeline
                            for <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> from the off-loading point near
                            Saigon to the Saigon airport (we asked about sabotage possibility and he
                            admitted that this would be a problem), and also to build a road east
                            from Attopeu in Laos. For the latter purpose, combat troops would be
                            needed to protect the engineers.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. This undoubtedly has serious political
                            hurdles, but again the flood situation might provide a cover for
                            immediate activity that would lay a foundation.</p>
                        <p>c. T-28 Aircraft. Admiral Pirie had just informed him that the Navy had a
                            going production line and could add seal-proof tanks and armor at once

                            and should certainly be followed up at once. I believe it is agreed in

                        <p>Apart from these urgent needs, the Admiral had the following
                            comments:</p>
                        <p>e. In general, he thought that the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> report would probably recommend all possible
                            assistance short of the introduction of combat forces. (Apparently this
                            would not exclude the helicopters and engineer operations suggested
                            above.)</p>
                        <p>f. The Caribou aircraft need was very much downgraded by Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName>. He thought C-47’s
                            could do the job and that the Caribou had simply appealed to Diem when
                            introduced by the Godel group.</p>
                        <p>g. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> did see a
                            legitimate need for T-33 aircraft, with 2 as a starter. The military
                            purpose would be to build up a Vietnamese air defense capability,
                            leading eventually to the introduction of F-86F aircraft as in Thailand.
                            He wants an immediate start in training Vietnamese pilots in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>. This seems much more dubious to me from a
                            military standpoint. If the North Vietnamese or <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> air forces become involved now or
                            later, surely we would deal with them by US carrier aircraft. In any
                            event, any useful Vietnamese <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0458"/>capability is at least 1-2 years away, and this might be a poor time
                            to divert effort for such long lead-time projects.</p>
                        <p>h. <gloss target="#t_ChiNats1">ChiNats</gloss>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> reported Diem’s view that some
                            ChiNat forces could be introduced, naturalized as Vietnamese, and used
                            profitably in the Delta area, where there is already a large number of
                            ethnic Chinese. He understood that State had turned this down, and asked
                            us to see what could be done.</p>

                            regard the concept of a flood relief task force as essentially a cover
                            plan for the introduction of US troops into <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. Such is not my view. The flood in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> is a real emergency program, capable of
                            giving real assistance to the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
                            authorities charged with relief measures as well as a military
                            reinforcement to assist in safeguarding the area from a return of the
                            Viet Cong who have fled before the high waters.</p>
                        <p>This concept does not amount to a cover as it undertakes to conceal
                            nothing. It does give our forces a good reason for coming and the
                            termination of flood relief, a matter at least of months, would give our
                            forces a good reason for going. In the meantime they would have
                            satisfied Diem’s request for troops with a commitment far smaller than
                            that required to make a military or psychological impression if the
                            announced purpose was merely to render aid to suppress the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency. If we come in for this latter
                            purpose, we will have to talk in terms of the three divisions … .</p>

                                    suggested 2, or even 1, good teams preferable to three poor
                                    ones. Value of survey teams depends on quality of men on

                                    inquired whether request for 3,000-man augmentation for special
                                    forces was in addition to idea for ranger border force, and
                                    whether augmented special force would be under separate or same
                                    command nearer border force. He added that augmentation of
                                    special forces by 3,000 should not be done from existing
                                    military units, but if agreed should be recruited separately. I
                                    said that I would have to discuss this further; tentatively I
                                    thought that a special force for special operations should be
                                    continued under separate organization and command, but that I
                                    was not sure special force of 3 to 4,000 in addition to and
                                    separate from ranger border force was desirable. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said he hoped special

                                    to 5,000 rangers could be organized and deployed as suggested by

                                    President Diem to delegate full authority and responsibility,
                                    subject to Diem’s policy directives, to executive board composed
                                    of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>,

                                    more efficiently and promptly <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> policy decisions. Said his present thought is
                                    that Nhu should be given a specific cabinet responsibility with,
                                    namely, coordinating secretary for national security. Said, as
                                    previously, that only person <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0468"/>to whom President would delegate so much
                                    authority, and leave it delegated, was his brother Nhu. Said he
                                    felt such a board would materially improve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> performance. Asked my reaction.
                                    I told him that I did not wish to meddle officially in questions
                                    involving personnel of Government of Vietnam, but that I say
                                    officially that any organization under President Diem’s policy
                                    guidance which would give government greater efficiency and cut
                                    down on reaction time would be a welcome development, and is in
                                    fact an urgent necessity. I added that I did not know personally

                                    said he and others felt that this would make a definite

                                    executive performance; and that in any [case] it was only

                        <p>To very briefly summarize the past year, I feel that considerable
                            progress has been made but that developing conditions leave much yet to
                            be done with time of the essence. Due to Viet Cong actions, “finding
                            time” for even marginal troop training has been a major problem since
                            1959. Therefore, training programs have been integrated and
                            appropriately reoriented to improve overall <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps training, while at
                            the same time placing heavy emphasis on conducting counter-guerrilla
                            operations. Induction of the additional 20,000 force ceiling recommended
                            by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in October 1960, approved in
                            May 1961 and further retarded due to a question of U.S. fund support,
                            will be completed by January 1962. This 20,000 which was primarily
                            justified as a “rotational training base” and to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> logistical support is, of course,

                            critical emergency and then on a partially trained basis. The induction
                            of the additionally approved 30,000 will begin January 1962 with a
                            completion date of January 1963. To increase <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> combat capabilities, a Combat Development Test Center
                            has been organized and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has
                            developed and furnished the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> a
                            specially tailored tactical counter-guerrilla treatise titled “Tactics
                            and Techniques for Counter-Insurgent Operations,” which has been used
                            extensively since last November by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            advisors and <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and which is under
                            continuing joint <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> refinement. Following <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> insistence, the Civil Guard was
                            finally transferred from the Department of Interior to the Department of
                            Defense allowing <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisory support. Likewise, <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0470"/>certain U.S. military support

                            Corps has also been authorized. During the year, heartening improvement
                            was made in Navy, Marine and Air Force operations as well as in
                            logistical capabilities throughout all three services. Also, although
                            significant problem areas in implementation still remain, many of the
                            military recommendations in the U.S. Counter-Insurgency Plan have been
                            approved by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> edict such as a single
                            chain of command and the establishment of Field Command with its three
                            subordinate tactical corps. Of course, as mentioned previously, much of
                            importance remains to be done, not only with respect to new innovations,
                            but also in the all important areas of urgency, implementation and
                            follow through. As <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has no command
                            authority, this is quite difficult. For example, the single chain of
                            command has been too much downgraded by continuing Presidential
                            insistence on retaining the Province Chief in the military chain of
                            command and supporting him against higher military commanders in purely
                            military matters. This problem will be further discussed in a later
                            paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Since my September year end report, significant and revealing trends
                            which were beginning to emerge have since further materialized. The most
                            indicative is the recently accelerated infiltration and build up of Viet
                            Cong strength, particularly in the northern and central sections of
                            South Vietnam. The sparsely settled and rugged jungle terrain along the
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>-Lao border make it exceedingly
                            difficult to stop or materially slow down Communist infiltration from
                            North Viet-Nam through Laos. Positive hard intelligence on infiltration
                            of personnel from North Vietnam, especially accurate numbers, has been
                            difficult to obtain as our intelligence is necessarily based on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reports with whatever verification can
                            be gotten from our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors with
                            tactical and intelligence units. Although as you know, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> under its present staffing and
                            current terms of reference cannot function as an intelligence evaluating
                            or producing agency, reports from American intelligence agencies, plus
                            circumstantial evidence when correlated with known events reasonably
                            establishes a high degree of infiltration as a fact. The current fairly
                            firm estimate of regular, numerically designated Viet Cong units in
                            Viet-Nam is approximately 17,000 as compared with an estimated 7,500
                            upon my arrival fourteen months ago. This force in itself, not
                            considering the additional Communist capability due to their build up in
                            Laos, is capable of selective large scale operations in South Vietnam.
                            This capability is significantly increased by Communist control of the
                            terrain along the Lao-<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> border and
                            intelligence indications that the Viet Cong are “regularizing” and
                            reorganizing territorial units within South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>The Viet Cong initiative in September in both the north and central
                            areas-I and II Corps Zones-gave further testimony of this infiltration
                            capability. In marked contrast to the previous comparatively low level
                            of Viet Cong activities in these areas, the September attacks were
                            larger and more numerous. October has been deceptively quiet in both I
                            and II Corps as far as large scale attacks are concerned but political
                            and subversive incidents have risen sharply. In September, Viet Cong
                            activities included at least a dozen attacks by units reported by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> in strengths of from 300 to 500 each.
                            The attacks in Kontum Province on 1 September were made by a force
                            estimated by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and our advisor on
                            the ground as three “battalions” totalling 1,000 personnel (Viet Cong
                            battalions vary from 100 to 600). These troops were reportedly much
                            better trained and equipped than any previously encountered and the
                            attacks were executed with considerable professional skill. Although
                            they overran small isolated Civil Guard posts, relieving <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops, in most cases, inflicted
                            comparable casualties in return for casualties suffered. During this
                            same period, Viet Cong armed activity in the southern or Delta region
                            continued at a normal high level with, however, a significant increase
                            in political and subversive activity. Furthermore, the major portion of
                            the Viet Cong forces, about 10,000, are located in this region and they
                            are considered the best trained and best equipped of the Viet Cong
                            regular forces.</p>
                        <p>Considering the currently identified regular Viet Cong forces in the
                            country, they have the capability of increasing both the frequency and
                            magnitude of their attacks. These attacks may well be coordinated to a
                            greater degree, but will more probably follow the present pattern of hit
                            and run, with the limited objective of further weakening government
                            control. If, however, infiltration continues to accelerate
                            significantly, it may well indicate that the Communists have stepped up
                            their timetable and plan to move into a larger scale, more conventional
                            campaign designed to conquer a portion or all of South Vietnam. The
                            “National Front Liberation of South Vietnam” has announced its intent of
                            seizing and holding an enclave in South Vietnam, declaring it a
                            liberated area and establishing a government which would then be quickly
                            recognized as “legal” by the Soviet bloc. That they have not yet been
                            able to accomplish this indicates the “Front” has not yet gained
                            adequate political or military strength to overcome the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military capability here.</p>
                        <p>As the Viet Cong offensive is multi-pronged, I believe it very important
                            that our officials at all policy and decision making levels be fully
                            current on the inter play and effect of the application of all elements
                            of national power by both sides on the overall pacification effort here.
                            Currently, the main emphasis is in the military field because of the
                            advanced development of the insurgency. However, <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0472"/>as <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has spelled out in the military section of the
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan and in its Tactics and Techniques of
                            Counter-Insurgent Operations treatise, military action alone, even
                            though successful, is not the answer and can even be counterproductive
                            if not preceded and followed by coordinated interlocking political,
                            psychological and economic action in consonance with an overall National
                            Plan. Without the development and employment of a
                            politico-military-paramilitary infrastructure to secure militarily
                            cleared areas for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, the Viet Cong
                            will move back as <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces, of
                            necessity, go to new missions. Of course, this has an adverse
                            psychological impact on the population. Military successes of
                            June-July-August have been dissipated by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> failure to follow through and truly reassert and
                            maintain government control. This control and reconstruction phase can
                            only be accomplished by the civil authorities with the help of the
                            paramilitary forces. I am convinced that a concerted effort at US-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> level is absolutely necessary if
                            President Diem and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> are to
                            develop the required National Plan together with an adequate
                            Intelligence Organization and a working control and coordination
                            framework in which all governmental elements including the military can
                            operate in a meaningful and effective manner. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> excuse that they do not have sufficient
                            trained leadership must not be allowed to postpone the implementation of
                            these required actions. Otherwise, the military will continue to be held
                            responsible, both in Viet-Nam and in our country, for failure to obtain
                            and capitalize on desired and timely results which, acting alone it
                            cannot hope to achieve.</p>
                        <p>Although increasing emphasis on military planning and combat operations
                            is certainly in order, additional measures other than military are
                            required to motivate the people to resist Viet Cong blandishments and
                            terrorist methods to the point of actively assisting the government’s
                            counter-insurgency efforts. The inability of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to protect the lives of the people in far flung
                            villages is, of course, an important factor. Also, the population must
                            be induced through political, economic and psychological measures to
                            support the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with greater patriotic
                            ardor than now appears evident. For example, General “Big” Minh,
                            Commanding General of Field Command, reported to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is receiving progressively less
                            cooperation from the villagers in the matter of information on Viet Cong
                            presence and activities. This could be the result of governmental
                            relations with the people. Also, it could be the result of the impact of
                            Viet Cong initiative in the north following so closely upon the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> initiative and successes in the
                            Delta. Whatever the cause, it again emphasizes the need for an adequate
                            overall <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> organization which will
                            operate from the top levels to the villages and hamlets to properly
                            counter the insurgency. <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0473"/>Until
                            this is accomplished, military operations can, at best, result in a
                            series of isolated and temporary victories. I have repeatedly and
                            forcefully urged in my letters and in conversations with both President
                            Diem and Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> the necessity for the development of a National
                            Level Operations Plan into which a Military Operations Plan can be
                            integrated. Such a plan must include at all appropriate levels an
                            adequate Command/Control Structure such as agencies subordinate to the
                            National Internal Security Council designed to dynamically apply all
                            elements of national power in proper combination-economic, political and
                            psychological, as well as military. In this respect, although the
                            National Internal Security Council has been established by Presidential
                            Decree, it is not yet functioning in its intended role.</p>
                        <p>At <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s urging, “Big” Minh’s Field
                            Command, the headquarters charged with planning and executing the
                            military phase of the counter-insurgency effort, is now developing the
                            military portion of such a plan. While the plan needs to be coordinated
                            on a geographically phased “amoeba principle” starting with the
                            clearance of various key areas and expanding these areas until the
                            entire country is covered, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> does
                            not feel this plan should or could be prepared on a rigid or mechanical
                            time schedule basis. Because of the advanced state of the insurgency and
                            because of the limited forces available to counter it, I feel that an
                            inflexible timetable approach would be unrealistic. As indicated in the
                            paper Lansdale will furnish you, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            has prepared an outline for a National Geographically Phased Operations
                            Plan which it is hoped will assist in furthering the military effort and
                            could serve as a point of departure for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> planning in this area. In addition, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> currently has representation on a
                            Saigon Task Force committee which is now writing such an overall
                            National Plan for presentation to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Military morale continues to be a problem stemming from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> failure to properly plan and organize
                            their counter-insurgency effort. Slow promotion, low pay in the lower
                            grades, charges of political favoritism, unavoidable long separation
                            from families due to necessarily extended operational troop commitment,
                            poor family housing and the like no doubt have an adverse affect on
                            soldier and officer morale. Although some of these are normal soldier
                            “gripes” which in most cases can and are being remedied, the import of
                            this situation is not discounted here. However, I feel a more serious
                            morale problem lies in a deep sense of frustration caused primarily by
                            too often seeing hard won victories watered down by inadequate
                            civil-military follow through measures which allow the Viet Cong to
                            regain control in areas after clearance by military action.</p>

                        <p>As noted previously, another critical problem hampering the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in its pacification effort is the
                            serious lack of hard and timely intelligence. This results from the
                            uncoordinated condition of the presently established <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence community. Although, of
                            course, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is primarily concerned
                            with instructional advice and assistance in the military intelligence
                            field, we have repeatedly pointed out to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that the present fragmentation of the overall
                            countrywide intelligence effort into several unrelated and uncoordinated
                            civil and military agencies will not answer the requirement in a
                            situation where the value of information is measured in minutes and
                            hours. In response to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and Country
                            Team urging for central intelligence control and direction in the
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan, President Diem created the Central Intelligence
                            Organization. However, at present this organization has neither the
                            personnel nor the charter to do the job and there now appears to be some
                            doubt that Diem actually intends that centralized control and direction
                            of intelligence be vested in one organization. Apparently, he does not
                            feel he has a suitable man or that he can trust any one official to this
                            degree. However, despite the problems facing the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, some method of obtaining adequate, timely, grass roots
                            level intelligence must be developed if the Viet Cong is to be
                            defeated.</p>
                        <p>With respect to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s all important
                            mission of guiding <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> training, a
                            Master Training Plan designed to overcome the long standing situation of
                            units being inadequately trained due to continuing operational
                            commitments has been developed jointly with <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>. This plan is a sound and logical extension of the
                            improvements in the training effort here which has, during the past
                            year, been fully reoriented on counter-guerrilla operations and ranger
                            type training as well. In addition to regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units including the 20,000 and 30,000 increases, this
                            plan is also designed to train the Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps.
                            As previously mentioned, the Civil Guard was formerly under the
                            Department of Interior where they received limited police type
                            instruction and the Self Defense Corps, for all practical purposes,
                            received no military training. As you know, over two years ago this
                            insurgency had developed far beyond the capability of normal police type
                            law enforcement. Since the transfer of the Civil Guard to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>,
                            with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> guidance has trained these
                            units to the full extent possible considering operational commitment,
                            time and facilities which, of course, leaves much to be desired. Their
                            training schedules have been most carefully worked out and repeatedly
                            reviewed to ensure at least adequate training in the shortest possible
                            time. I feel that the Civil Guard is currently receiving a minimum
                            amount of training consistent with developing an acceptable capability
                            to perform their mission and that to further reduce training time could
                            well result in a <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0475"/>“paper
                            trained” force not capable of success against the Viet Cong. Provided
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s Master Training Program is
                            not further cut by directive and can be followed, all <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units, including the 20,000 and
                            30,000 force increases, plus the Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps will
                            be developed into a trained force within the shortest possible time
                            consistent with local conditions, facilities and necessary heavy
                            operational commitments.</p>
                        <p>Considering the language barrier and personnel requirements, I am
                            convinced that the worldwide <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            concept of teaching indigenous personnel to act as instructors rather
                            than “face to face” training by U.S. personnel is certainly the soundest
                            way to build a strong, viable, self sufficient Armed Force in the host
                            countries. For this reason, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has
                            resisted sporadic pressures here beamed at Americans running all
                            training centers and schools. In this respect, the shortage of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> officers to act as instructors could
                            be somewhat alleviated by calling back the large number of officers now
                            on non-military assignments. To speed training, additional <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> advisors have been requisitioned.
                            This will also allow us to do a better job of teaching the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> to stand on its own feet as the
                            Army of a sovereign nation should do.</p>
                        <p>As you know, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and
                            his group have proposed a series of actions designed to further assist
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in countering the insurgency
                            while concurrently coping with the floods in the Delta area.<note n="5" xml:id="d200fn5">See <ref target="#d190">Document
                                190</ref>.</note><gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, in
                            association with the other U.S. agencies here is now working out
                            coordinated positions and recommendations for implementation of these
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>One of the actions under study is the matter of blocking infiltration
                            from Laos into the high plateau area. Currently <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has finally induced <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to combine small, inefficient static border posts into
                            larger mobile patrol bases and to build light plane strips in some areas
                            along the border. Presently, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> does
                            operate clandestine cross border patrols from five blocking units
                            astride main penetration routes… . Also, over a year ago, when I found
                            that the borders could not be sealed by political action, I proposed to
                            President Diem that a “cordon sanitaire” be established along the entire
                            land border of South Vietnam. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s proposal for a Border Force to be organized
                            from existing ranger units trained and equipped for prolonged service
                            along the border zone is similar in many respects to the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> concept which Lansdale will furnish
                            you. The major difference is that the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> plan did not envision <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces operating regularly or deeply on the Lao side of
                            the border. Also, the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            group proposals envision that all elements of this force be completely
                            under military control. As no purely <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0476"/>military action can completely seal the border, I feel
                            our planners and policy makers should understand that presently
                            contemplated action can do no more than reduce the present rate of
                            infiltration. Therefore, I believe that intensified action at our
                            highest diplomatic levels should be continued toward a workable border
                            control arrangement not only with Laos, but with Cambodia as well.</p>
                        <p>A most significant proposal by the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> group is the introduction of U.S. military
                            forces-to be accomplished, at least initially-under a cover plan
                            centered around the present flood conditions in the Delta.<note n="6" xml:id="d200fn6">See <ref target="#d191">Document 191</ref>.</note>
                            This plan envisions service type troops as part of a Flood Relief Task
                            Force which, over an extended period of time would assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in rehabilitation of the area. For the
                            protection of these units, U.S. combat troops would also be committed
                            here. I fully recognize the advantages, for psychological as well as
                            military reasons, of establishing a U.S. military presence in Vietnam.
                            As you know, as recently as last spring, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommended a brigade task force of at least two
                            Battle Groups be committed here as “school troops” to assist in speeding
                            up <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> training. At that time,
                            considering the level of Viet Cong activity in the I and II Corps areas
                            where it was planned to station them, it was felt that these two battle
                            groups, provided they were not fragmented into small isolated packages,
                            could perform their mission without becoming heavily involved in
                            fighting the Viet Cong. Later, due to increased Viet Cong
                                activity,<gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> recommended that if
                            U.S. combat troops were to be introduced for the primary purpose of
                            freeing <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> fighting units, which
                            would then result in their becoming involved in counter-guerrilla
                            warfare, a strength of two divisions, suitably reinforced with combat,
                            logistic and air support would be required initially. Provided U.S.
                            combat troops are to be used solely to protect U.S. logistic units in
                            the flood area, three battle groups are considered adequate. However, I
                            am now convinced that unless deployed in sufficient strength the Viet
                            Cong, both for military and propaganda reasons, will eventually consider
                            U.S. troops a prime target. Of course, I have no doubt that American
                            troops will fully live up to their traditions if forced to fight.
                            However, it is important that combat troops sent here be specially
                            trained and equipped for counter-guerrilla warfare, that they come
                            expecting to fight and that they be prepared for extended commitment.
                            Most important of all, it is essential that these forces be totally
                            under U.S. command and that command and control relationships, support
                            and other arrangements such as a status of forces agreement and the like
                            be fully agreed between the two governments prior to and not after their
                            arrival.</p>
                        <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0477"/>
                        <p>A joint survey of the security situation at the Provincial level has been
                            proposed by the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> group and
                            accepted by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This is a logical
                            and forward looking extension of a recently obtained joint <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            agreement to inspect Province Chiefs’ security arrangements at all
                            installations employing <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units. The
                            proposed joint survey is of particular interest to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> because of the previously mentioned
                            “dual position” of Province Chiefs with respect to the military and
                            political chain of command and because of the importance of working out
                            improved civil-military cooperation at Province level.</p>
                        <p>One of the basic conclusions reached during my initial assessment of the
                            military situation in September 1960, was the absolute necessity for a
                            single, inviolate chain of command. In addition to previous
                            recommendations, the necessity for the reorganization of the command
                            structure of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and for the
                            establishment of a single chain of command was spelled out in the
                            Counter-Insurgency Plan. A significant degree of success was achieved
                            when a Presidential Decree, and the subsequent implementing directive,
                            enacted most of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            recommendations. While this decree did not remove the Province Chief
                            from the military chain of command, it is the most workable solution
                            obtainable at this time. This is because Diem, who personally selects
                            his Province Chiefs and holds them in high regard, desires that these
                            officials retain a high degree of control. Of the thirty-eight Province
                            Chiefs in Vietnam, all but six are military officers and are supposedly
                            under tactical zone (divisional) commanders for military operations
                            involving any significant number of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> troops. For this reason, although their military
                            qualifications vary greatly, Diem feels that for all practical purposes,
                            the military chain of command is now satisfied. However, in actual fact,
                            this is not entirely true.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that the proposed joint survey can be used as a vehicle to
                            remedy this situation as it cannot be rectified by the military alone.
                            Because of the dual role of the Province Chief and his “direct line” to
                            the highest civil levels of the government, it will be necessary for the
                            political member of the survey group to insist on corrective action.</p>
                        <p>Other <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> group proposals
                            which are primarily in the nature of measures to improve intelligence
                            and further improve <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> mobility are
                            now being staffed as priority matters. These actions present no
                            particular problem except that with respect to intelligence a change in
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> terms of reference may be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, this report has been frank and objective with emphasis on
                            what remains to be done rather than the very significant improvements
                            which we have made over the past year. Naturally, our progress is due in
                            large part to the fine cooperation and <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0478"/>support of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            and all agencies throughout the Department of Defense. Again, our
                            position here is complicated primarily by lack of authority to direct
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take proper politico-military
                            measures which will adequately coordinate the overall counter-insurgency
                            effort from the viewpoint of required
                            political-military-economic-psychological actions. For the above
                            reasons, I feel that these interlocking military-political actions need
                            heavy pressure from our political side if they are to be accomplished
                            adequately and in time.</p>

                        <p>575. Task Force <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. Our conversations over
                            past ten days with Vietnamese in various walks of life show virtually
                            unanimous desire for introduction US forces into VietNam. This based on
                            unsolicited remarks from Cabinet Ministers, National Assembly Deputies,
                            university professors, students, shopkeepers, and oppositionists. Dr.
                                <persName>Tran Dinh De</persName>, level-headed Minister of Health,
                            told Embassy officer Oct 29 that while <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> could continue resist Communists for while longer if US
                            troops not introduced, it could not win alone against Commies. National
                            Assembly members, according to … unanimously in favor entry US forces.
                            Diem told us while Gen <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            was here that he had consulted National Assembly committee on this
                            question and had received favorable response. Even an oppositionist like
                            ex-Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_TVD1">Tran Van Do</persName>
                            has told us US forces are needed and is apparently so strongly convinced
                            of this that he did not suggest any condition precedent about political
                            changes by Diem. AmConsul Hue reports that opinion among intellectuals
                            and government officials in that city is also almost unanimously in
                            favor of introduction of American combat troops. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> believes on basis private
                            conversations and general attitude Vietnamese military personnel <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0479"/>toward US that Vietnamese armed
                            forces would likewise welcome introduction US forces.</p>
                        <p>General Vietnamese desire for introduction US forces arises from serious
                            morale decline among populace during recent weeks because of
                            deterioration in security and horrible death through torture and
                            mutilation to which Col Nam subjected. Expanded <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infiltration has brought fully home to Vietnamese that
                            fact that US has not intervened militarily in Laos to come to rescue of
                            anti-Communists. Now that they see Viet-Nam approaching its own crucial
                            period, paramount question in their minds is whether US will give armed
                            support to anti-Communist <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or whether
                            it will back down when chips are down. Vietnamese thus want US forces
                            introduced in order to demonstrate US determination to stick it out with
                            them against Communists. They do not want to be victims of political
                            settlement with Communists. This is especially true of those publicly
                            identified as anti-Communist like Dean <persName corresp="#p_VQT1">Vu
                                Quoc Thuc</persName> who collaborated with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_SEA1">Eugene Staley</persName> on joint experts

                        <p>Most Vietnamese whose thoughts on this subject have been developed are
                            not thinking in terms of US troops to fight guerrillas but rather of a
                            reassuring presence of US forces in VietNam. These persons undoubtedly
                            feel, however that if war in Viet-Nam continues to move toward overt
                            conventional aggression as opposed to its guerrilla character, combat
                            role for US troops could eventually arise.</p>

                            began its own analysis of these twenty proposals. The results of the
                            Joint Staff’s work were to be submitted to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on Monday.<note n="4" xml:id="d202fn4">Apparently a

                            recommendations. In particular, as indicated below, the question of

                        <p>Turning now to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            recommendations, much of the staff work involved is being done in the
                            field. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s message

                            work that was to be done by him and by the Country Team in South Viet
                            Nam. Apart from the Joint Staff exercise already mentioned Washington
                            planning has concentrated primarily on General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s principal proposal-a military
                            flood relief task force. The Pentagon is engaged in a review of a troop
                            list for such an operation prepared by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Viet Nam. It generally agrees with the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>’s proposals which envisage
                            engineering construction units (including road-building units), a
                            hospital task force, two helicopter companies, small boat units, etc. It
                            has also examined such questions as the problem of the Geneva Accords
                            and the need for a status of forces agreement.</p>
                        <p>There are two interrelated questions that seem to be causing some
                            considerable difficulty to Washington agencies in thinking about General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s concept: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> has
                                    stated that combat troops would be included in the task force
                                    for protection of relief operations. He also envisages that the
                                    flood relief task force would constitute a military reserve in
                                    the event of a heightened crisis. He has stated in addition
                                    however, that the flood relief task force concept is not
                                    intended as a cover for introduction of combat troops. Many in
                                    Washington are convinced that the longer the forces remained in
                                    Viet Nam, the more they would come under attack and the more
                                    they would become involved in combat. If we do not intend to be
                                    forced out of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> altogether,
                                    there is real doubt as to whether. once we committed <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0481"/>forces, we could withdraw them
                                    until reasonable security had been restored in Viet Nam.</item>

                                <item><p>There is some question as to whether General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> intends that the
                                        task force will remain in Viet Nam only long enough to do
                                        the immediate relief and rehabilitation job or whether it
                                        will stay on to engage in reconstruction activities. There
                                        is some evidence that suggests that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s intention is the
                                        latter for he refers in various messages to their staying
                                        for “an extended period” and for “a matter at least of
                                        months”.</p>
                                    <p>This question is related to the one above for, as has been
                                        stated the longer the troops remain, the more they are
                                        likely to become involved in combat operations. This
                                        uncertainty also poses problems for the AID aspects of such
                                        a relief program. The estimates from the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> that are still awaited
                                        will apparently cover only immediate relief and
                                        rehabilitation needs and will not cover reconstruction
                                        requirements.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName>’s paper suggests that, for

                            and a 500man logistic support unit be sent to Viet Nam. These units
                            would be entirely for flood relief operations, would have no combat-unit
                            support, would be prepared to defend themselves, but would move out of
                            an area if attacked. We would justify their introduction entirely on the

                            on North Viet Nam’s activities in South Viet Nam since it would not be
                            relevant to the justification of this operation. We would also argue
                            that as a relief operation, our activities did not constitute a breach
                            of the Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <p>The paper argues that the introduction of a large force-say 10,000-would
                            require a prior decision that we were prepared if necessary to go on to
                            a much larger, presumably <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>,
                            operation. The paper proposes that the President send a letter to Diem
                            in which he would say that the commitment of U.S. troops to security
                            operations would be conditional upon <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            performance on a whole series of measures on which we have been long
                            attempting to obtain action.</p>
                        <p>This approach is designed in part to solve some of the timing dilemmas by
                            which we are now faced. It would simplify the problem for the Nehru
                            visit by temporarily by-passing the Geneva Accords question and would
                            permit immediate action to deal with <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0482"/>the flood while giving more time to consider the
                            tougher questions involved in sending larger military units. By sorting
                            out the two elements involved in General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s proposal, it does tend to weaken one of the
                            principal advantages of that proposal. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s recommendation would permit
                            creation of a base for a subsequent direct U.S. military contribution to
                            the handling of the security problem while temporarily avoiding some of
                            the political disadvantages of intervention and giving us at least some
                            continuing freedom of action on commitment to combat operations.</p>
                        <p>I do agree, however, that in making a decision on the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> proposal we need to face and to
                            decide in principle the question of whether we are prepared, if
                            necessary, to step up very considerably our military commitment in Viet
                            Nam. If we commit 6-8000 troops and then pull them out when the going
                            got rough we will be finished in Viet Nam and probably in all of
                            Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Economic Planning and Financing</hi></p>
                        <p>A final area to which some thought has been given is the financing of a
                            relief and rehabilitation operation. I attended a meeting in State on
                            Monday on this subject.<note n="7" xml:id="d202fn7">No other record of
                                this meeting has been found.</note> Some action was taken a week or
                            more ago to provide immediate rice supplies, to offer additional such
                            supplies and to provide medicine. Washington, however, is still waiting
                            for the Country Team’s long-promised list of other requirements. The
                            list should be received within the next few days; as a result of my
                            suggestion a message will be sent to Saigon to ensure that we have at
                            least some preliminary estimates by the end of the week so that
                            something will be available when General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s recommendations are considered.</p>
                        <p>Since the Country Team estimates are expected to cover only relief and
                            rehabilitation, it is believed that they will present no serious funding
                            problems. A reconstruction program could be much more expensive and
                            would probably pose real problems, including the possible necessity for
                            some kind of supplemental aid appropriation. The recommendation to the
                            President will probably take the form of a proposal that he simply
                            decide in principle that this is a priority operation and that necessary
                            funds will be provided to finance it.</p>
                        <p>I have been assured by both State and Defense and they are keeping
                            informed of each other’s planning. I also raised at the meeting Monday
                            the question of whether we could be sure that <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>’s planning of flood relief requirements would be
                            carefully related to the composition of the military task force that the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had proposed; if we were going
                            to send highway engineers we <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0483"/>would, for example, need also to provide for road and bridge repair
                            materials. Although there was some indication that some others present
                            considered this a potential problem, the general view seemed to be that
                            we must assume that the different parts of the Country Team would
                            coordinate their work.</p>

                        <p>The first of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            recommendations for immediate action in his message of last Friday<note n="8" xml:id="d202fn8">Apparently a reference to <ref target="#d196">Document 196</ref>.</note> was for a survey of the flood
                            problem, perhaps by a team of experts from the U.S. As I have told you,
                            before this message was received State had prepared a message suggesting
                            that George Tanham head a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> group to make this study. That
                            proposal was killed on Saturday by <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis
                                Johnson</persName>. Instead a more general message asking Saigon
                            whether they needed any help on this problem was apparently sent. The
                            answer, we are told, was that no help was required; that the Country
                            Team could do the job.<note n="9" xml:id="d202fn9">The messages under

                                751K.00/10-2861 and 751K.00/10-2961)</note> However, these messages
                            are not available outside of the State Department and it was not clear
                            whether they referred specifically to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s proposal. At the meeting on
                            Monday morning I was assured by State and Defense representatives that
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> did indeed have all the experts required. However,
                            with some difficulty I did obtain the apparent agreement of State people
                            on Monday afternoon that they would send a message to Saigon which would
                            refer specifically to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s proposal and request embassy views.</p>
                        <p>The situation with respect to the 64 helicopters is rather complex. As
                            indicated earlier, the entire question of requirements for
                            short-take-off-and-landing (STOL) aircraft and helicopters is being
                            studied by the Joint Staff as a single problem. An estimate of two
                            companies (44 helicopters), furnished earlier by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, is included in this study.
                            These 44 helicopters were intended solely for the purpose of providing
                            greater mobility to the Vietnamese army. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s concept envisaged use of
                            helicopters for flood relief purposes as well. It is not clear to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> how the new <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> estimate of 64 helicopters to which General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> referred in his Friday message
                            is related to the previous requirement for 44. Since there are already
                            nineteen helicopters in Viet Nam, it was considered possible that no
                            further addition was intended. At the other extreme, the entire 64 might
                            be intended as a separate flood relief requirement. <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0484"/>At my urging the Pentagon has agreed to
                            send a message to <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> seeking
                            clarification.</p>
                        <p>Supplying these helicopters is going to require a Presidential decision
                            for at least two reasons: (a) it will involve a judgment that the risks
                            involved in taking them from other units in the continental U.S. or in
                            the Pacific are acceptable; and (b) if they are to be used in support of
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> army operations, a clear-cut
                            violation of the Geneva Accords will be involved. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> apparently has decided in principle
                            that the 44 can be provided, but the Services and overseas commands are
                            going to scream when helicopters are taken away from them. I have urged
                            that a decision be sought to get the helicopters earmarked and
                            pre-positioned. I will pursue this aspect of the matter further
                            today.</p>
                        <p>As the above indicates, it is very difficult for Washington to get into
                            the act very effectively until it has been exposed in much more detail
                            to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s thinking. He
                            has promised specific recommendations on November 1.</p>

                                on October 31 was found.</note> you might wish to pursue the
                            following questions with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis
                                Johnson</persName>: (a) The need for help from outside the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> in surveying the flood problem and actions to deal
                            with it; (b) Whether the President must not address himself to the
                            broader question of how far we intend to go in providing military
                            support to Viet Nam when he considers the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recommendation for a flood relief task force; and
                            (c) How we deal with Nehru on the question of the Geneva Accords. I just
                            don’t see how we can by-pass this last problem if we intend to accept
                            the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recommendations as we
                            now understand them. (No reference should be made to the <persName corresp="#p_WCB1">Wood</persName> paper. The copy I have is a

                        <p>In view of the fact that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell
                                Taylor</persName> is due to report to you shortly and also because
                            of the type of stories which are beginning to appear in the press and
                            based on interviews, speculations, etc., I thought that with all
                            respect, I should make my views known to you on this most important,
                            delicate and dangerous situation. Hence, this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The question of the possibility of sending American troops to Viet Nam
                            has occurred a number of times in the past. First, in 1954, at the time
                            of the battle of Dienbienphu, then last May, when the Vice President
                            made his visit to Southeast Asia, and most recently, on the occasion of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>’s visit
                            to Viet Nam. In my opinion, this is a matter which should be approached
                            with the greatest caution.</p>
                        <p>On several occasions we have made commitments to use our own troops,
                            while the Russians have carefully avoided using theirs. The sending of
                            American armed forces to Viet Nam may be the wrong way and probably
                            would be, in present circumstances. In the first place, we would be
                            engaged without the support of significant allies. Our troops would be
                            engaged by third-string communist forces (North Vietnamese). Then, they
                            could very well become engaged against the second-string-the Chinese
                            Communists, who might be drawn into the fray and could out-match us and
                            our Asian allies many times in manpower. If American combat units land
                            in Viet Nam, it is conceivable that the Chinese Communists would do the
                            same. With shorter lines of communication and transportation, with much
                            more manpower available, South Viet Nam, on that basis, could become a
                            quicksand for us. Where does an involvement of this kind end even if we
                            can bring it to a successful conclusion? In the environs of Saigon? At
                            the 17th parallel? At Hanoi? At Canton? At Peking? Any involvement on
                            the mainland of Asia would seem to me to weaken our military capability
                            in Berlin and Germany and, again, leave the Russians uncommitted.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me that the presence of American combat troops in South
                            Viet Nam could be misinterpreted in the minds of millions of Southeast
                            Asians and could well be considered as a revival of <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0490"/>colonial force. Moreover, we must be
                            extremely wary of any seemingly simple solution that would have Asian
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> nations do the intervening
                            at our behest to avoid this appearance. If we give them the go-ahead,
                            then there is every likelihood that we shall have to follow militarily
                            or if we do not, we will suffer disastrous repercussions throughout all
                            of Asia and we will indeed become the laughing stock of the world.</p>
                        <p>While Viet Nam is very important, we cannot hope to substitute armed
                            power for the kind of political and economic social changes that offer
                            the best resistance to communism. If the necessary reforms have not been
                            forthcoming over the past seven years to stop communist subversion and
                            rebellion, then I do not see how American combat troops can do it today.
                            I would wholeheartedly favor, if necessary and feasible, a substantial
                            increase of American military and economic aid to Viet Nam, but leave
                            the responsibility of carrying the physical burden of meeting communist
                            infiltration, subversion, and attack on the shoulders of the South
                            Vietnamese, whose country it is and whose future is their chief
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>
                            has seen the situation in this light in the past. He had almost an
                            obsession with getting the French military out of Viet Nam and I find it
                            somewhat difficult to believe that he is now anxious for American combat
                            forces as a base for his continuance in power. This point, it seems to
                            me, should be clarified before we commit combat forces or even
                            underwrite a commitment of Asian <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            forces. And it should be clarified in direct conversations between you
                            and President Diem, not through intermediaries who might, from talks
                            with lesser officials, reach the erroneous conclusion that it is Diem’s
                            view that such forces should be sent.</p>
                        <p>Our problem now is little different than it was in World War II and the
                            years after: to minimize our involvement, particularly military, on the
                            Asian mainland not to maximize it. In this connection, I must say that
                            the antagonism towards Cambodia is most incomprehensible. That is our
                            point of minimum involvement and cost in Southeast Asia and with a
                            tolerable situation instead of alienating that country we ought to be
                            seeking to create through diplomacy comparable situations of minimum
                            involvement and cost.</p>
                        <p>Within the framework of the problem of minimizing rather than maximizing
                            our involvement, I am convinced that we can do far more than we have
                            done, by a judicious diplomacy and more effective aid in Viet Nam. I
                            would repeat the recommendations which I made in an earlier memorandum,
                            dated September 20, 1961:<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">Not printed.

                            significant factor in the situation. The following suggestions may be
                            useful in extracting from the mission its greatest possible
                            contributions to the making of these changes: <list>

                            throughout Southeast Asia by Asian <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces. In present circumstances, it seems to me we
                            must exercise every caution to avoid another Korean-type involvement on
                            the Asian mainland. Such an involvement would appear to me to play
                            completely into the hands of the Soviet Union, since it will get them
                            off their present Chinese ideological hook and open all sorts of new
                            prospects in the really decisive area of Germany and Europe. An
                            involvement on our part can lead to four possible adverse results: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Against these four adverse possible consequences, there is the bare
                            possibility of one salutary outcome. U.S. combat forces (not <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> allied forces) might provide that
                            bare margin of effectiveness which would permit a solution of the
                            guerrilla problem in South Viet Nam or prevent further encroachments
                            southward-assuming of course that the Chinese Communists, let alone the
                            Russians, do not become involved. Even then, we will have achieved a
                            “victory” whose fruits, if we would conserve them, will cost us billions
                            of dollars in military and aid expenditures over the years into the
                            future.</p>

                            continuing military progress but some months ago the time was reached
                            when <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must be guided into supporting
                            political, social and economic actions as a matter of urgency if the
                            military contribution can be meaningful and permanent. Reported
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>-Diem-<persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> talks indicate possibility of
                            break-through in this field similar to that in military field. However,
                            recommended that U.S. not make firm commitments unless conditioned at
                            least in part on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> performance. In
                            Saigon <gloss target="#t_Emtel1">Emtel</gloss> to State limited
                            distribution 558 <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> appears
                            definite on questioning if 3,000 Special Forces was to be in addition to
                            Ranger Border Forces mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s estimate of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            capability to organize and deploy 4-5,000 Rangers. If more Ranger Units
                            are to be organized this will further dangerously dilute <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> leadership and manpower capability
                            and should be critically examined. If currently organized Rangers are to
                            be used this will take over half of units now in being for “Border
                            Ranger Force” which are now assigned elsewhere and will need replacing.
                            Mobility for these Rangers raises problem of command. Close coordination
                            and agreement between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> commanders and
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> “can be made to work” only if
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> commands this transportation.
                            Although I have made written representation Diem, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and Ty, under my “advisory role”
                            I have not in over a year gotten really adequate cooperation on joint
                            operational planning. I feel prior command authority for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is imperative. This same applies, any
                            American Units or individuals which may be assigned here. There are also
                            other military factors such as terrain that need considering in any
                            analysis of this plan and of course current significant operations and
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> plans need consideration.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Lansdale</persName>’s special
                            capabilities would be most acceptable for this “Command” as long as the
                            operation is under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> command. I am
                            under the impression that <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0495"/>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> was thinking in
                            the direction of placing the entire border force under military command.
                            I feel this should be the case.</p>

                        <p>In respect to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s request for
                            American instructors for the Thu Duc Reserve Officers School, this again
                            opens the question of so-called “face to face” training-use of advisors
                            as instructors. I invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and the Ambassador to SSNG <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> to inspect <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> worldwide concept of training indigenous personnel to
                            train their own forces. In my considered opinion this is only way <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces will ever be taught to carry
                            their own load-and am concerned at change from Diem’s previous attitude
                            to “give me the material and I will do the job” to what appears to be
                            “you do it for me.” This war can and will be won only by the Vietnamese
                            themselves; we should consider the danger of “over helping” to the point
                            of dulling their own determination and resolve. The specific officers
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> mentioned as “not very
                            good” are top graduates of last class who, following the U.S. OCS
                            concept, remain to instruct the new students-and then only in School of

                            and will do job well and in time.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion we most hopeful that Joint Survey of situation at Province

                        <p rend="center">A PLAN FOR SOUTH VIETNAM</p>
                        <p>The situation in South Viet-Nam is perilously close to the point of no
                            return. Serious thought is being given to a military operation in South
                            Viet-Nam which would entail all the risks of the operation in Korea of
                            ten years ago, without the justification of a surprise attack across the
                            boundary, without the support of the United Nations, and without a
                            population determined to fight for independence. This paper suggests a
                            United States program which would entail neither abandonment of South
                            Viet-Nam nor a major military involvement on our part.</p>
                        <p>The proposal assumes that our long-run objective in South Viet-Nam should
                            be the creation of an independent, economically viable and politically
                            neutral state, rather than a limping American satellite. As a beginning,
                            we would want an end to the fighting in South Vietnam, and a United
                            Nations presence to supervise the keeping of the peace. We would also
                            hope that a start could be made towards a strong, responsive and
                            popularly based government in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Certain circumstances seem to make this a propitious time for an approach
                            along the lines suggested here. The Geneva Conference on Laos appears to
                            be reaching its climax. The split between the Soviet Union and Communist
                            China has come into the open, and seems to be at an acute stage. Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> will be in position
                            to transmit in both directions the thoughts of the President, and of
                            India and others at the United Nations. The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission and some of the accompanying press
                            reports have given credibility to possible United States military
                            intervention, and have thus probably <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0497"/>increased our bargaining position vis-a-vis the
                            Russians, the Chinese Communists and the neutrals.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend:</p>
                        <p>1. Replacement of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> by an ambassador of the character and prominence
                            of Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. We need
                            someone who can hold his own with both Diem and the United States
                            military, who will insist once and for all on government reform, and who
                            will understand the United States political implications of developments
                            there. If <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> himself is
                            unavailable, I would suggest David Lilienthal or <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">George McGhee</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. A United Nations resolution confirming the independence of the
                            Republic of Vietnam, and calling for immediate dispatch of United
                            Nations observer groups to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The proposal for such a resolution should come, if possible, from a
                            country not directly associated with the United States, and the program
                            for an observer team, as in Lebanon, or a UNEF as in the Gaza Strip,
                            should be in response to an invitation from the Government of Vietnam.
                            The observers should be drawn primarily from the national forces of
                            United Nations members other than the permanent members of the Security
                            Council. The United States should make it clear, however, that it stands
                            ready to supply personnel and equipment for a United Nations contingent
                            in Viet-Nam as needed, and that any American personnel sent to Viet-Nam
                            would share the functions of other United Nations personnel and would be
                            subject to the control of the United Nations command. (This would
                            presumably not affect the present <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            in Vietnam.)</p>
                        <p>The scope of the observer group would be to report not only on
                            infiltration into Viet-Nam from outside, but also on any activity within
                            the country dangerous to the peace. The United Nations observer group
                            would be assembled and dispatched under arrangements made by the Acting
                            Secretary General, and its operations would be supervised by him in
                            consultation with a small advisory committee. The theory of the
                            authorizing resolution would, of course, be that the Viet Cong activity
                            against the present Government of Viet-Nam is directed from outside of
                            South Viet-Nam and therefore constitutes external aggression.</p>
                        <p>This proposal should be presented to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> now. Since India is the chairman
                            of the present <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> in Viet-Nam and since
                            the object of the United Nations presence is in part to replace the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and to perform more effectively
                            the job of keeping the peace, Nehru’s agreement to the proposal would be
                            most important.</p>
                        <p>3. Prompt agreement at Geneva on a neutral Laos, including an
                            understanding that Laos is not to be used as a corridor or staging point
                            for operations in South Vietnam. If possible, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> might approach the Russians on
                            the subject of the mutual <pb n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0498"/>interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in cessation of
                            fighting in South Viet-Nam as well as in Laos.</p>
                        <p>4. In any event, the Prime Minister might be sounded out on his
                            approaching <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> along the
                            following lines: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>5. In talking with Nehru, we should make clear that the United States
                            stands ready both to continue its present program of economic assistance
                            to Vietnam, and to contribute to possible programs of the United Nations
                            Special Fund in the area.</p>
                        <p>The program recommended here avoids the high risk and limited promise
                            alternative of armed intervention. Its long-range hopes are that South
                            Viet-Nam would become a viable independent state, North Viet-Nam would
                            become less dependent on Communist China, daily life in both countries
                            would become safer and more prosperous, and the Sino-Soviet struggle for
                            dominance in Southeast Asia might abate.</p>

                            the report of the mission which visited South Vietnam, Thailand, and
                            Hong Kong in the period 15 October to 3 November 1961 in compliance with

                            the recommendation of Ambassador <persName>Brown</persName> who, with
                            Brigadier General Boyle, his <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            Chief, came to Bangkok to discuss the Laos situation with us. In
                            addition to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, the
                            members of my party included representatives of State, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, Defense, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>My recommendations, already laid before you by cable, represent the
                            emergency program which we feel our Government should implement without
                            delay. After you have reached a decision on this program, it will be a
                            major challenge to our governmental machinery in Washington to see that
                            the many segments of the program which involve many departments and
                            agencies are executed with maximum energy and proper timing. I would
                            suggest that a formalized procedure be established and promulgated to
                            assure effective and orderly implementation.</p>
                        <p>While we feel that the program recommended represents those measures
                            which should be taken in our present knowledge of the situation in
                            Southeast Asia, I would not suggest that it is the final word. Future
                            needs beyond this program will depend upon the kind of settlement we
                            obtain in Laos and the manner in which Hanoi decides to adjust its
                            conduct to that settlement. If the Hanoi decision is to continue the
                            irregular war declared on South Viet-Nam in 1959 with continued
                            infiltration and covert support of guerrilla bands in <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0500"/>the territory of our ally, we will then
                            have to decide whether to accept as legitimate the continued guidance,
                            training, and support of a guerrilla war across an international
                            boundary, while the attacked react only inside their borders. Can we
                            admit the establishment of the common law that the party attacked and
                            his friends are denied the right to strike the source of aggression,
                            after the fact of external aggression is clearly established? It is our
                            view that our government should undertake with the Vietnamese the
                            measures outlined herein, but should then consider and face the broader
                            question beyond.</p>
                        <p>We cannot refrain from expressing, having seen the situation on the
                            ground, our common sense of outrage at the burden which this kind of
                            aggression imposes on a new country, only seven years old, with a
                            difficult historical heritage to overcome, confronting the inevitable
                            problems of political, social, and economic transition to modernization.
                            It is easy and cheap to destroy such a country whereas it is difficult
                            undisturbed to build a nation coming out of a complex past without
                            carrying the burden of a guerrilla war.</p>
                        <p>We were similarly struck in Thailand with the injustice of subjecting
                            this promising nation in transition to the heavy military burdens it
                            faces in fulfilling its role in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            security planning along with the guerrilla challenge beginning to form
                            up on its northeast frontier.</p>
                        <p>It is my judgment and that of my colleagues that the United States must
                            decide how it will cope with <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>’s “wars of liberation” which are really
                            pare-wars of guerrilla aggression. This is a new and dangerous Communist
                            technique which bypasses our traditional political and military
                            responses. While the final answer lies beyond the scope of this report,
                            it is clear to me that the time may come in our relations to Southeast
                            Asia when we must declare our intention to attack the source of
                            guerrilla aggression in North Viet-Nam and impose on the Hanoi
                            Government a price for participating in the current war which is
                            commensurate with the damage being inflicted on its neighbors to the
                            south.</p>
                        <p>In closing, let me add that our party left Southeast Asia with the sense
                            of having viewed a serious problem but one which is by no means
                            hopeless. We have many assets in this part of the world which, if
                            properly combined and appropriately supported, offer high odds for
                            ultimate success.</p>
                        <p>Basically the forces at work in Vietnam, Thailand, and Hong Kong are
                            extremely positive in character. Everywhere there is new activity and
                            momentum. In the long run there is no reason to believe that the rate of
                            growth and the degree of modernization in non-Communist Asia as a whole
                            will be outpaced by developments in Communist Asia. There is no need for
                            fatalism that, somehow, <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0501"/>Southeast Asia will inevitably fall into Communist hands. We have the
                            means to make it otherwise.</p>

                                <item>Communist strategy aims to gain control of Southeast Asia by
                                    methods of subversion and guerrilla war which by-pass
                                    conventional U.S. and indigenous strength on the ground. The
                                    interim Communist goal-en route to total take-over-appears to be
                                    a neutral Southeast Asia, detached from U.S. protection. This
                                    strategy is well on the way to success in Vietnam.</item>

                                <item>In Viet-Nam (and Southeast Asia) there is a double crisis in
                                    confidence: doubt that U.S. is determined to save Southeast
                                    Asia; doubt that Diem’s methods can frustrate and defeat
                                    Communist purposes and methods. The Vietnamese (and Southeast
                                    Asians) will undoubtedly draw-rightly or wrongly-definitive
                                    conclusions in coming weeks and months concerning the probable
                                    outcome and will adjust their behavior accordingly. What the
                                    U.S. does or fails to do will be decisive to the end
                                    result.</item>

                                <item>Aside from the morale factor, the Vietnamese Government is
                                    caught in interlocking circles of bad tactics and bad

                                    defensive in ways which permit a relatively small Viet-Cong
                                    force (about one-tenth the size of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> regulars) to create conditions of frustration
                                    and terror certain to lead to a political crisis, if a positive

                                    Asia</hi></p>
                            <p>At the present time, the Communists are pursuing a clear and
                                systematic strategy in Southeast Asia. It is a strategy of extending
                                Communist power and influence in ways which bypass U.S. nuclear
                                strength, U.S. conventional naval, air, and ground forces, and the
                                conventional strength of indigenous forces in the area. Their
                                strategy is rooted in the fact that international law and practice
                                does not yet recognize the mounting of guerrilla war across borders
                                as aggression justifying counter-attack at the source.</p>
                            <p>The strategy is a variant on Mao’s classic three-stage offensive.
                                First, a political base for guerrilla war, subversion, and
                                dissidence is established in each country in the area, exploiting
                                its unique vulnerabilities via trained local or introduced cadres.
                                Second, guerrilla war <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0504"/>is
                                begun. Third, a maximum effort is made to translate the Communist
                                position achieved on the ground, plus the weakness and
                                cross-purposes in the non-Communist camp, to induce a neutralist
                                interim solution, blocking the U.S. military presence, as with the
                                proposed renunciation by Laos of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> protection. Complete Communist take-over, by
                                whatever means may appear feasible, is the evident ultimate
                                objective.</p>
                            <p>Mao’s third stage-overt conventional warfare, with guerrillas in an
                                ancillary role-is apparently now judged too dangerous to pursue, on
                                the grounds that it is likely to trigger U.S. (or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>) intervention.</p>
                            <p>This modified Mao strategy is actually underway in Laos and South
                                Vietnam. Cambodia, with <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>’s anticipatory collaboration, has already
                                adjusted to the likelihood (in his view) that the Communist strategy
                                will succeed. The strategy is clearly foreshadowed in Thailand. The
                                initial bases for such a program have been laid in Malaya,
                                Indonesia, and Burma; but they will probably not be exploited to the
                                full until the South Viet-Nam struggle is favorably resolved. The
                                Communists undoubtedly believe-and with good reason-that if the
                                strategy succeeds in Laos and South Viet-Nam the enterprise will
                                rapidly gather momentum throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
                            <p>This is not the only possible Communist strategy in Southeast Asia.
                                An overt use of Viet-Minh and <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> divisions is conceivable, although the terrain
                                and logistical structure of Southeast Asia sets a relatively low
                                limit on the scale of conventional engagement in that theater. And
                                it is in the range of possible contingencies that such a direct
                                attack might be backed by some Soviet nuclear power. But current
                                strategy is as described.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Communist Strategy in South
                                    Vietnam</hi></p>
                            <p>In South Viet-Nam the tactical application of this general strategy
                                is now in an advanced stage. An internally organized guerrilla war
                                is being conducted in the South, recently expanded and strengthened
                                with professional cadres. A second front of military pressure has
                                been built up in the Central Plateau, with significant components of
                                infiltration via Laos and the systematic exploitation of Montagnard
                                and sect dissidence. In addition, a pocket of reserve strength is
                                organized above Saigon in <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss>
                                (perhaps 1500 troops), available for a climactic strike in the
                                context of a political crisis. The Viet-Cong command a capability
                                for considerable terroristic activity in and around Saigon.</p>
                            <p>The military strategy being pursued is, evidently, to pin down the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> on defensive missions; to
                                create a pervasive sense of insecurity and frustration by
                                hit-and-run raids on self-defense corps <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0505"/>and militia units, ambushing the reserve forces if
                                possible as they come up to defend; and to dramatize the inability
                                of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to govern or to build, by
                                the assassination of officials and the sabotage of public works.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile a reserve force of unknown size and capability is being
                                created in the forests and mountains surrounding the plateau,
                                straddling the Laos (and possibly Cambodian) border which offers a
                                supply base, a relatively secure infiltration route, and safe haven.
                                Depending on its size and capability, this force could be used for a
                                series of demoralizing raids on the cities of the plateau, on the
                                model of the raids on Phouc Thanh. It could attempt to seize and
                                hold the Kontum-Pleiku area, declaring, as in Xieng Khouang, a new
                                government to be recognized by Bloc states. It could by-pass the
                                plateau cities and, by infiltration down to the sea, isolate the
                                coastal cities much as the Mekong cities have been isolated by the
                                Pathet-Lao.</p>
                            <p>One of the most important facts about the situation in Viet-Nam is
                                that the size and capabilities of the Viet-Cong forces in the
                                plateau are not known. Its capabilities could range from a mere
                                capacity to continue to harass, to a capacity, when surfaced, of
                                producing a Dien Bien Phu.</p>
                            <p>On current evidence we lean to a conservative assessment of this
                                force (perhaps 4000); but it justifies a concentrated intelligence
                                effort, and a quick-action contingency plan, as well as the specific
                                action proposed in the appendices. (See, especially, Appendix F,
                                Frontier Force Vietnam.)</p>
                            <p>Despite the considerable guerrilla capabilities of the Viet-Cong,
                                Communist strategy now appears, on balance, to aim at an essentially
                                political denouement rather than the total military capture of the
                                country, as in the case of Mao’s campaign in China. A maximum effort
                                is under way to increase political disaffection at every level;
                                among the sects, the minority groups, the trade unions, the
                                students, and the intellectuals. Energetic efforts to dramatize the
                                weaknesses of Diem’s regime and to induce discouragement about U.S.
                                policy in Laos and Southeast Asia generally are being pursued. The
                                enemy objective seems to be to produce a political crisis by a
                                combination of military and non-military means out of which would
                                come a South Vietnamese Souvanna Phouma, willing to contemplate
                                unification on terms acceptable to Hanoi, including disengagement
                                from the U.S.</p>

                                in 1961 in the southern region (NAMBO) was accompanied by a sharp
                                increase in organization in which the infiltration of cadres from
                                the north probably played a significant part. A more substantial
                                increase occurred in 1961 in the northern region (Intersector Five).

                                August and September. In September there was a doubling of
                                Vietnamese casualties and a much less than proportionate increase in
                                casualties inflicted on the Viet-Cong. This is a statistical
                                reflection of the situation which helped bring on the present
                                crisis. In October the increased casualty rate persisted.</p>

                            <p>It must be remembered that the 1959 political decision in Hanoi to
                                launch the guerrilla and political campaign of 1960-61 arose because
                                of Diem’s increasing success in stabilizing his rule and moving his
                                country forward in the several preceding years. Meanwhile, word has
                                spread throughout Viet-Nam that Hanoi’s rule has led to brutality
                                and hunger. Men may believe that Hanoi is the wave of the future and
                                a route to unification; but the Communist <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0508"/>performance in the North is not
                                admired. The considerable grandeur of the Viet Minh in the early
                                1950’s has been largely dissipated. By comparison, this is a pretty
                                shabby offensive, both militarily and politically, although
                                potentially lethal. The maximum estimate of voluntary, positive
                                support for the Communists in South Viet-Nam is about 200,000 or 2
                                per cent of the population. (Appendix I.)<note n="9" xml:id="d210fn9">Appendix 1, dealing with covert matters, is not

                                estimate is about half this level.</p>

                            <p>Beneath the surface of this immediate crisis are two vicious circles
                                which have been operating for many months in South Viet-Nam and
                                which the improvement in atmosphere in the months preceding
                                September tended only superficially to conceal.</p>
                            <p>The first vicious circle is military. The lack of firm and well
                                organized operational intelligence has helped produce a defensive
                                disposition of forces to guard against Viet-Cong attack-a stance
                                perhaps inherited to some degree from the French and not effectively
                                corrected by subsequent U.S. training. This defensive stance has
                                drawn 80 to 85 per cent of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, including the bulk of the specially trained Ranger
                                Force, into essentially static tasks. Thus, initiative has been
                                conceded to the enemy.</p>
                            <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0509"/>
                            <p>This, in turn, has made worse a bad system of civil-military
                                relations. The bulk of the military forces remain in control of the
                                Province Chiefs because it is their responsibility to protect the
                                population and installations of their areas; a defensive strategy
                                thus automatically puts the bulk of the military in their hands.
                                When enemy attacks take place, forces are brought up from reserve
                                too slowly to be effective, due to a lack of effective command and
                                control, communications, and mobility.</p>
                            <p>A very high proportion of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                                casualties (perhaps 90 per cent) results from ambushes which derive
                                directly, in turn, from these operational characteristics. The
                                consequent inability effectively to protect the people leads, in
                                turn, to a drying up of the basic sources of intelligence and limits
                                the government’s ability to raise recruits.</p>
                            <p>Thus, poor intelligence, poor command and control arrangements, and
                                poor mobility reinforce each other, leading to a defensive military
                                disposition of resources and a progressive deterioration in the
                                military position of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>The second vicious circle, interwoven with the first, is political.
                                As is widely understood, Diem’s instinctive administrative style is
                                that of an old fashioned Asian ruler, seeking to maintain all the
                                strings of power in his own hands, while fragmenting power beneath
                                him. The inability to mobilize intelligence effectively for
                                operational purposes directly flows from this fact, as do the
                                generally poor relations between the Province Chiefs and the
                                military commanders, the former being Diem’s reliable agents, the
                                latter a power base he fears. The consequent frustration of Diem’s
                                military commanders-a frustration well known to Diem and heightened
                                by the November 1960 coup-leads him to actions which further
                                complicate his problem; e.g., his unwillingness to delegate military
                                operations clearly to his generals.</p>
                            <p>Beyond the military circle, Diem’s operating style and the personal
                                political insecurity it has generated leads him to mistrust
                                excessively many intellectuals and others of the younger generation
                                who are badly needed to give his administration vitality and contact
                                with the people. Many of these men and women are profoundly
                                anti-Communist and capable of constructive use in the national
                                effort; but, on the sidelines (or frustrated within the
                                administration), they spend their efforts in complaints against the
                                regime, while their country sinks towards a Communist take-over they
                                do not want.</p>

                                to American guidance and aid to achieve a turning point in Vietnam’s
                                affairs. From all quarters in Southeast Asia the message on Viet-Nam
                                is the same: vigorous American action is needed to buy time for
                                Viet-Nam to mobilize and organize its real assets; but the time for
                                such a turn around has nearly run out. And if Viet-Nam goes, it will
                                be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to hold Southeast Asia.
                                What will be lost is not merely a crucial piece of real estate, <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0511"/>but the faith that the U.S.

                            <p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of this mission’s effort is the
                                unanimity of view-individually arrived at by the specialists
                                involved-that what is now required is a shift from U.S. advice to
                                limited partnership and working collaboration with the Vietnamese.
                                The present war cannot be won by direct U.S. action; it must be won
                                by the Vietnamese. But there is a general conviction among us that
                                the Vietnamese performance in every domain can be substantially
                                improved if Americans are prepared to work side by side with the
                                Vietnamese on the key problems. Moreover, there is evidence that
                                Diem is, in principle, prepared for this step, and that most-not
                                all-elements in his establishment are eagerly awaiting it.</p>
                            <p>There is a second conclusion. We have attempted to answer the
                                political and psychological question: would the more substantial
                                involvement of Americans be counter-productive (see especially
                                Appendix G)? Our conclusion-based on experience and judgment in
                                Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand-is the following. If Americans come in
                                and go to work side by side with the Vietnamese, preferably outside
                                Saigon, the net effect will almost certainly be positive. The danger
                                lies in excessive headquarters establishments and a failure to do

                                tasks is excellent.</p>
                            <p>After all, the United States is not operating in Southeast Asia in
                                order to recreate a colonial system doomed by history; it is
                                attempting to permit new nations to find their feet and to make an
                                independent future. Despite Communist propaganda, this is widely
                                understood. When Americans work hard and effectively in this area,
                                they meet friendship.</p>
                            <p>Such side by side partnership requires, of course, men of tact,
                                strongly motivated to come and to get on with the task. They must be
                                led at every level by Americans of first rate technical competence,
                                imagination and human sympathy. It is our conviction that such <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0514"/>Americans exist and can be
                                recruited for the specific tasks listed below. On the other hand,
                                the selection of personnel for these operations must be done with
                                extreme care. The operation will fail if the U.S. is not willing to
                                contribute its best men to the effort in adequate numbers and to
                                keep them in the field for substantial periods.</p>

                            <p>To execute this program of limited partnership requires a change in
                                the charter, the spirit, and the organization of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in South Vietnam. It must be
                                shifted from an advisory group to something nearer-but not quite-an
                                operational headquarters in a theater of war. The objective of this
                                shift is clear. The U.S. should become a limited partner in the war,
                                avoiding formalized advice on the one hand, trying to run the war,
                                on the other. Such a transition from advice to partnership has been
                                made in recent months, on a smaller scale, by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in Laos.</p>
                            <p>Among the many consequences of this shift would be the rapid build-up
                                of an intelligence capability both to identify operational targets
                                for the Vietnamese and to assist Washington in making a sensitive
                                and reliable assessment of the progress of the war. The basis for
                                such a unit already exists in Saigon in the Intelligence Evaluation
                                Center. It must be quickly expanded. (Appendix I.)</p>

                            <p>The famous problem of Diem as an administrator and politician could
                                be resolved in a number of ways: <list>
                                    <item>—By his removal in favor of a military dictatorship which
                                        would give dominance to the military chain of
                                        command.</item>
                                    <item>—By his removal in favor of a figure of more dilute power
                                        (e.g., Vice President <persName corresp="#p_NNT1">Nguyen
                                            Ngoc Tho</persName>) who would delegate authority to act
                                        to both military and civil leaders.</item>
                                    <item>—By bringing about a series of de facto administrative
                                        changes via persuasion at high levels; collaboration with
                                        Diem’s aides who want improved administration; and by a U.S.
                                        operating presence at many working levels, using the U.S.
                                        presence (e.g., control over the helicopter squadrons) to
                                        force the Vietnamese to get their house in order in one area
                                        after another.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>We have opted for the third choice, on the basis of both merit and
                                feasibility.</p>
                            <p>Our reasons are these: First, it would be dangerous for us to
                                engineer a coup under present tense circumstances, since it is by no
                                means certain that we could control its consequences and
                                potentialities for Communist exploitation. Second, we are convinced
                                that a part of the complaint about Diem’s administrative methods
                                conceals a lack of first-rate executives who can get things done. In
                                the endless debate between Diem and his subordinates (Diem
                                complaining <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0516"/>of limited
                                executive material; his subordinates, of Diem’s bottleneck methods)
                                both have hold of a piece of the truth.</p>
                            <p>The proposed strategy of limited partnership is designed both to
                                force clear delegation of authority in key areas and to beef up
                                Vietnamese administration until they can surface and develop the men
                                to take over.</p>
                            <p>This is a difficult course to adopt. We can anticipate some friction
                                and reluctance until it is proved that Americans can be helpful
                                partners and that the techniques will not undermine Diem’s political
                                position. Shifts in U.S. attitudes and methods of administration as
                                well as Vietnamese are required. But we are confident that it is the
                                right way to proceed at this stage; and, as noted earlier, there is
                                reason for confidence if the right men are sent to do the right
                                jobs.</p>

                            <p>Although Diem’s fundamental political problem is his inability to
                                take the offensive, protect his villages and win the war, at many
                                points his ability to win is, in turn, inhibited by the gap between
                                his government and the people of South Vietnam. Proposals to narrow

                            <p>Although these-and other measures-should be attempted, our basic
                                policy must be to diminish the tension arising between the <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0517"/>government and the people
                                stemming from the security situation. The record shows that the
                                disintegration of the political situation in South Viet-Nam since
                                1959 is primarily due to the government’s inability to protect its
                                citizens and to conduct the war effectively.</p>
                            <p>Against this background, we turn to the specific recommendations
                                contained in the Appendices with respect to the interlocked
                                questions of intelligence, command and control, mobility, and
                                training. These are the technical areas where <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> improvement must be achieved if a
                                successful offensive is to be launched.</p>

                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has been, almost literally,
                                fighting blind-awaiting attack before it responded and then
                                responding slowly, awkwardly, and ineffectively. Guerrilla
                                operations are designed to present few and fleeting targets. The
                                successful conduct of guerrilla war requires a highly sophisticated
                                intelligence effort, intimately geared to operations at every level
                                from the villages to the planners. Viet-Nam has been served by a
                                primitive and fragmented intelligence system, only obliquely linked
                                to and focused on the problem of finding and seeking targets. Aside
                                from U.S. encadrement of the intelligence system, and the
                                strengthening of the U.S. Evaluation Center (earlier noted),
                                Appendix A, VII, suggests the following two broad and urgent
                                measures: <list>
                                    <item>—Assign clear national responsibility for intelligence
                                        collection and evaluation to the Central Intelligence

                            <p>Given the acute lack of qualified U.S. personnel, the suggestions in
                                these Appendices will require careful and urgent screening to ensure
                                that U.S. advice and influence are applied selectively at crucial
                                points.</p>

                            <p>The ambiguous role of the Province Chief-at once commander of the
                                militia, “sector commander” nominally subject to the military, and
                                Diem’s political agent, with direct access to him, is a familiar and
                                fundamental weakness on the Viet-Nam scene. The recommendation in
                                Appendix A is: “remove Province Chiefs from the chain of command of
                                the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces.” This could prove
                                to be the answer. But the immediate proposal of the mission, already
                                accepted by Diem in principle, is that joint U.S.-Vietnamese teams
                                examine command and control relations (and other aspects of the
                                military problem) in each of the three Corps areas, province by
                                province, <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0518"/>beginning with
                                those provinces where the security situation is most acute.</p>
                            <p>It may prove to be the case that arrangements will be required
                                somewhat more complex than a clean separation of Army and militia
                                chains of command, for the following reasons: <list>
                                    <item>—Continued intimate cooperation between the Army and the
                                        militia will be necessary for both offensive and defensive
                                        operations.</item>
                                    <item>—The Army can be progressively disengaged from static
                                        duties (and thus from the Province Chiefs) only over a
                                        period of time.</item>
                                    <item>—Continued intimate relations between the Army Commanders
                                        and the Province Chiefs will be required, since the Province
                                        Chiefs will remain a basic source of intelligence for
                                        military operations.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>In short, we would anticipate that best results will be achieved by
                                some combination of greater freedom of action for the regular forces
                                and more effective cooperation between the civil and military at the
                                province level. But a definitive conclusion awaits the results of
                                the joint survey.</p>
                            <p>An essential ingredient in the command and control (as well as the
                                intelligence) problem is that the U.S. establish a parallel
                                communications system (as in Korea and in Laos) linking American
                                elements encadred in the field with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> headquarters. Such a system is essential both to
                                permit the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> staff to have a
                                reliable picture of field operations and to provide the basis for
                                timely U.S. intervention or persuasion at high Viet-Nam level.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Mobility</hi></p>
                            <p>The requirements of quick response in defense and surprise in attack
                                combine with the terrain, distances, and the inadequate roads of
                                Viet-Nam to justify a radical increase in the availability of
                                helicopters and light aircraft, and in work on ground mobility
                                techniques. Although command and control problems would have to be
                                solved if this new force were to be effectively used, we believe the
                                best way to force the necessary changes is to introduce U.S.
                                helicopter units, attached to each of the three corps, with U.S.
                                officers maintaining control under <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>. Even if desirable, there is no way of introducing
                                this kind of force except as U.S. military units, given the shortage
                                of pilots and maintenance personnel. (See Appendix A.)</p>
                            <p>Although the existing airlift in Viet-Nam is now not used with full
                                efficiency, it is likely that an increased requirement for C-47 (or
                                similar aircraft), as well as for lighter supply and personnel
                                aircraft will rapidly emerge, if the recommendations in this report
                                are adopted and yield some success. Basically, an effective
                                operation against the Viet-Cong requires ample air supply, as well
                                as ample troop-lift capacity. (Appendix A.)</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Reserves</hi></p>
                            <p>As noted earlier, the reserves available for systematic offensive
                                action in the Viet-Nam armed forces are shockingly low. There is one
                                battalion in reserve in the First Corps; two each in the Second, and
                                in the Third Corps. Evidently ways must be found to increase this
                                reserve. One major purpose of the proposed U.S.-Vietnam joint survey
                                of the military situation is to find out, in one region after
                                another, how this might be done. The major elements in the process
                                of expanding the reserve are already reasonably clear: <list>
                                    <item>—To find means more economical in [than?] troops to
                                        protect the villages and the major installations;</item>
                                    <item>—To accept an increased degree of risk in the protection
                                        of installations not of first importance;</item>
                                    <item>—To induce among the militia and the troops still assigned
                                        to protective missions a more aggressive stance, and, by
                                        local attacks on the Viet-Cong, to reduce Viet-Cong capacity
                                        and freedom to mount local raids.</item>
                                    <item>—To build up as rapidly as possible, via training and
                                        reequipment, the Civil Guard and the Self-Defense Corps so
                                        that the army can be progressively released for offensive
                                        action. (Appendix A.)</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>Appendix A suggests as a target that at least 50 per cent of the
                                regular armed force now on static posts should be released for
                                offensive operations. If intelligence can be made to yield useful
                                targets and mobility is provided, a force of this kind could
                                radically reduce the Viet-Cong menace. This would constitute a force
                                of some 70,000 men. Whether this force can be freed for <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> offensive operations without
                                unacceptable risk to the population and essential installations
                                remains to be seen.</p>
                            <p>In addition to measures taken by the Vietnamese to improve their
                                reserve position, it is an evident requirement that the United
                                States review quick action contingency plans to move into Vietnam,
                                should the scale of the Viet-Nam offensive radically increase at a
                                time when Vietnamese reserves are inadequate to cope with it. Such
                                action might be designed to take over responsibility for the
                                security of certain relatively quiet areas, if the battle remained
                                at the guerrilla level, or to fight the Communists if open war were
                                attempted.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Training</hi></p>
                            <p>It is our clear impression (Appendix A) that, by and large, training
                                and equipment of the Vietnamese armed forces are still too heavily
                                weighted toward conventional military operations. There has
                                undoubtedly been a shift towards guerrilla and counter-guerrilla
                                training, but it has not gone far enough. Even the Rangers are not
                                adequately trained or equipped for sustained jungle warfare. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                                <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0520"/>must use its influence
                                steadily and strongly towards increasing the component of
                                counter-guerrilla training at all levels in the Vietnamese armed
                                forces.</p>
                            <p>The Vietnamese require U.S. assistance in training at all levels,
                                from the War College down. They are constantly faced with the
                                painful choice of allocating good young soldiers either to combat
                                units or to instruction. In both areas the need is great. Given the
                                acuteness of the crisis, we must be prepared to ease this choice by
                                the generous provision of U.S. instructors.</p>
                            <p>As a first priority, the training of the Civil Guards should be
                                accelerated. About 20 per cent of this force has passed through
                                infantry training, and the results are encouraging. However, the
                                retrained Civil Guards will not be able to operate at full
                                efficiency until the grave shortage of officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>’s in the Civil Guards is corrected
                                (Appendix A). To help fill this gap as well as to encourage the
                                Civil Guards to undertake more aggressive tactics, including night
                                patrolling, we should consider assigning <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers and, in key areas, special forces teams
                                to work with the Civil Guards on whose increased efficiency the
                                possibility of generating an army reserve partially depends.</p>
                            <p>It should also be noted that the cost to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in local currency of training a Civil Guard is
                                substantially less than for a regular soldier; the annual cost to
                                the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for a regular, Civil Guard,

                            <p>With respect to the expansion of the Viet-Nam regular forces beyond
                                the present approved level of 200,000, no decision is immediately
                                required; although we should promptly approve the increase from
                                170,000 to 200,000 if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                                accepts its role in a program of the kind proposed here. (Appendix
                                E.) To deploy effectively an expanded regular army will require
                                progress in the inter-related measures outlined in this report.
                                Until the basic problems of intelligence, command and control, and
                                mobility are on their way to solution, a mere expansion in the army
                                will be of little help. Under present circumstances, the Viet-Cong
                                could pin down a much larger army than Saigon now commands. But to
                                cover the transitional period, the expansion to 200,000 is
                                necessary.</p>

                            <p>As indicated in Appendix A-V, the Viet-Nam Navy is in poor shape,
                                having played only a minor role in counter-insurgency operations. It
                                suffers in extreme form from a lack of proper intelligence and
                                command-control relations to the total effort. A substantial

                                U.S. Naval and/or Coast Guard forces may need to be moved in to
                                supplement the Vietnamese Navy until it can find its feet.</p>

                            <p>The U.S.-Vietnam Combat Development and Test Center has been at work
                                for some months. Its objective has been to establish whether various
                                more or less available U.S. technology could assist the Vietnamese
                                in fighting the Viet-Cong. The unit has worked under the usual
                                administrative difficulties attendant upon a new venture, including
                                poor liaison with certain elements of the Vietnamese armed forces.
                                Nevertheless, three significant conclusions have emerged: <list>
                                    <item>—First, current and foreseeable special techniques will
                                        offer no quick magic for defeating the Viet-Cong. The basic
                                        military, political and administrative problems outlined in
                                        this report must be solved with the help of R and D, but not
                                        by R and D alone, if the Vietnamese are to win.</item>

                                    <item>—Second, there are a range of limited concrete devices
                                        which could assist both militarily and psychologically in
                                        the war against the Viet-Cong. These deserve urgent and
                                        careful operational consideration, notably the following:
                                        the use of chemicals to attack the rice and manioc crop in
                                        carefully selected mountain areas where the Viet-Cong
                                        buildup depends on their own plantings to supplement a thin
                                        local food supply the rapid expansion in the use of dogs for
                                        patrolling; the installation of the village alarm system;
                                        and the use of Lazy Dog for attack on certain relatively
                                        fixed Viet-Cong targets.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>In addition, the possibilities of the AR-15 rifle should be explored
                                as well as of a plastic swamp boat.</p>
                            <p>A case for their usefulness having been established, the exploitation

                            <p>Given the fact that we do not yet know how much damage the flood will
                                cause, it is impossible to form a clear view of the approximate
                                total level of the U.S. aid to Viet-Nam over the coming year.
                                Nevertheless, certain basic propositions about the Vietnamese
                                economy and the relation of economic aid to this program can be
                                asserted with some confidence.</p>
                            <p>The fundamental economic fact about Viet-Nam is that the government
                                has exhibited a considerable capacity to execute important projects
                                in the fields of health, education, agriculture, and public works;
                                and the private sector has shown a surprising virility and
                                momentum.</p>
                            <p>These have been significant stabilizing factors in an otherwise
                                treacherous situation.</p>
                            <p>The momentum of the Vietnamese economy must be supported for a
                                further technical reason. As pointed out in Appendix D, the conduct
                                of war against the Viet-Cong requires an increasing supply of local
                                currency. That currency cannot be generated merely by giving the
                                Vietnamese dollars. It would be counter-productive if our dollars
                                should be used for the buildup of monetary reserves or unused
                                pipelines, for luxury imports, or for the imported commodities which
                                compete with their rapidly growing private industrial sector. The
                                problem is, therefore, to design a program of aid which will
                                generate local currency while encouraging civil domestic enterprises
                                which support the total <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                                effort.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the private sector, the most promising way to do this
                                is to increase the import of capital goods for industrial
                                development. With respect to government projects, the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> must <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0523"/>devise measures which generate local currencies in
                                conjunction with government projects. Appendix D suggests a series
                                of such projects where the local currency component might be raised
                                by public bond issues. This appears the principal new device by
                                which the paradox could be ended in which only private sector
                                projects supported by the United States develop local currency for
                                the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> budget.</p>
                            <p>In addition, it is clear that the Vietnamese must press forward with
                                their present considerable improvements in tax collection. Further,
                                in time, the Vietnamese must move on from the exchange rate
                                arrangements to which they have agreed in principle but which are
                                not yet in force-which would yield an average of 74 plasters
                                (including customs duties) to the dollar-to a more straightforward
                                exchange rate of about 80 (plus customs duties).</p>
                            <p>On the U.S. side, we must be prepared to provide whatever level of
                                dollar aid may be necessary if we are assured that the dollar aid is
                                being used for productive purposes which support the total
                                effort.</p>
                            <p>Some of the concrete projects which <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> should support which are directly related to the
                                counter-insurgency plan are the following: the feeder road program;
                                development, if proved feasible, of a TV system around Saigon, which
                                would link government and people more closely in a crucial region;
                                push to completion the present plans for the Vietnamese radio
                                system, including provision for widespread distribution of cheap
                                battery-operated receiving sets; support for the Montagnard program;
                                village communications. In addition it would be appropriate for
                                    <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> to join with our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the Vietnamese in considering

                                of the Viet-Cong are to be consolidated. Operations in the flood
                                areas should give an opportunity to learn in a practical way how
                                this might be done.</p>

                            <p>The present flood is a disaster, enveloping two provinces and

                                major opportunity for the Vietnamese and for the joint U.S.-Vietnam
                                partnership which this report proposes.</p>
                            <p>In general it offers to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> a
                                chance to mobilize all anticommunist elements in a common
                                constructive national effort. For the United States it offers an
                                opportunity to introduce limited but still meaningful military
                                forces to assist in the emergency and reconstruction effort, making
                                available within the country for further use precisely the types of
                                engineering forces which the logistics part of Appendix A
                                recommends.</p>
                            <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0524"/>
                            <p>Although the exact contours of the job cannot be discerned until the
                                flood waters recede, it is clear that a reconstruction effort will
                                be required for many months. This effort offers to the Vietnamese
                                government an opportunity to get closer to the people in the
                                villages in an important southern area and to see if it cannot
                                reconstruct the area with military and civil arrangements which
                                prevent the re-entry on a large scale of the Viet-Cong. In a sense
                                the flood is a sweep; and the problem is to consolidate after the
                                sweep.</p>
                            <p>The presence of American military forces in the area should also give
                                us an opportunity to work intensively with the Civil Guards and with
                                other local military elements and to explore the possibility of
                                suffusing them with an offensive spirit and tactics.</p>
                            <p>The introduction in this area of substantial American forces raises,
                                of course, the problem of their protection. The precise nature of
                                the risks run can only be assessed on the spot by the local U.S.
                                commander. It is evident that a certain risk will be run of daytime
                                sniping and ambush and of night raids. With intensive cooperation
                                with the local military and militia and certain elementary
                                precautions, these risks appear capable of control. The precise
                                techniques for dealing with these risks must rest with the Task
                                Force Commander; but he should be supplied with units and other
                                resources required to do the job.</p>
                            <p>Although further staff work will be required to assess the size and
                                composition of an appropriate U.S. flood reconstruction force, we
                                would now envisage a unit of perhaps 8000 men.</p>

                            <p>The U.S. action proposed in this report-involving as it does the
                                overt lifting of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> ceiling,
                                substantial encadrement and the introduction of limited U.S.
                                forces-requires that the United States also prepare for
                                contingencies that might arise from the enemy’s reaction. The
                                initiative proposed here should not be undertaken unless we are
                                prepared to deal with any escalation the communists might choose to
                                impose. Specifically we must be prepared to act swiftly under these
                                three circumstances: an attempt to seize and to hold the
                                Pleiku-Kontum area; a political crisis in which the communists might
                                attempt to use their forces around Saigon to capture the city in the
                                midst of local confusion; an undertaking of overt major hostilities
                                by North Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>As noted earlier, the present contingency plans of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> must embrace the
                                possibility both of a resumption of the communist offensive in Laos
                                and these Vietnamese contingency situations. Taken together, the
                                contingencies in Southeast Asia which we would presently choose to
                                meet without the use of nuclear weapons appear <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0525"/>to require somewhat more balanced
                                ground, naval, and air strength in reserve in the U.S. than we now
                                have available, so long as we maintain the allocation of the six
                                divisions for the Berlin crisis.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, one of the major issues raised by this report is the need
                                to develop the reserve strength in the U.S. establishment required
                                to cover action in Southeast Asia up to the nuclear threshold in
                                that area, as it is now envisaged. The call up of additional support
                                forces may be required.</p>
                            <p>In our view, nothing is more calculated to sober the enemy and to
                                discourage escalation in the face of the limited initiatives
                                proposed here than the knowledge that the United States has prepared
                                itself soundly to deal with aggression in Southeast Asia at any
                                level.</p>

                            <p>In summary, it is the consensus of the military committee that
                                intervention under <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> or U.S.
                                plans is the best means of saving <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and indeed, all of Southeast Asia. Should this
                                prove impossible for non-military reasons we consider there are two
                                general ways in which the combat effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> can be increased substantially.
                                The first and most immediate requirement is to assure that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> makes maximum effective use of its
                                current resources. Its present conduct of military operations leaves
                                much to be desired. By taking certain corrective measures and
                                developing more effective <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0526"/>procedures, it is our opinion that the combat effectiveness of
                                    <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> could be improved by an
                                estimated 25 to 40 percent. The second method involves determining
                                reasonable courses of action within United States resources short of
                                military intervention or direct combat support by air and naval
                                combat elements which can appreciably improve both the immediate and

                                    Questions.</hi></p>
                            <p>1. The stability of Diem’s regime is roughly proportionate to the
                                success of the military in controlling the Viet Cong threat. Since
                                1955, when Diem took over from <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bao
                                    Dai</persName>, his regime has survived constant threats of
                                varied intensity from religious sects, villagers, the intellectuals,
                                government offices and the military. At the present moment, the most
                                serious threat is posed by military officers, who might combine at
                                any time with government officials to depose Diem. Whether they move
                                or not will be largely conditioned by their estimate of whether they
                                can win against the Viet Cong under the Diem regime, or whether they
                                believe a new regime is indispensable to victory. If successful
                                operations are registered against the Viet Cong, the threat of a
                                coup will recede.</p>
                            <p>2. Bearing in mind the above limitations on corrective measures to
                                modify the Diem regime, the political base for the counterinsurgency
                                program could be improved if Diem would use the already created
                                Internal Security Council. This body includes the President,
                                Vice-President, Ministers of Interior and Information, the Assistant
                                Secretary of State for Defense, the Chief of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Joint Staff, and other senior
                                security officials.</p>
                            <p>The base could also be improved by an overall <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> national plan, integrating all fields of activity
                                related to the security problem.</p>
                            <p>A comprehensive phased military plan is now in preparation, although
                                apparently it is being done reluctantly.</p>
                            <p>It must be recognized that these administrative changes and planning
                                will proceed slowly, if at all.</p>
                            <p>3. The internal political effects of introducing U.S. Forces should
                                be considered. On the one hand, the danger exists that U.S. or
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> combat forces would be
                                equated in the minds of the villagers with the previous unfortunate
                                French experience. This would be hammered home by the Communists. On
                                the other hand, even opposition parties in the National Assembly
                                have recently expressed a desire for U.S. troops, and the evidence
                                on balance indicates that: <list>

                                state that the U.S. has abandoned Laos. They are concerned that the

                                gets rough. They are keenly aware of the effect of infiltration from
                                Laos and are certain it cannot be stopped by any weak <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0531"/>“neutral” Laotian government nor by
                                an <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, no matter how effective. At
                                the same time, a Lao settlement will not cause the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to abandon their efforts.</p>
                            <p>5. A major increase in U.S. military and economic aid would be most
                                welcome to all levels of the people and to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It would supply further
                                reassurances and proof of U.S. backing. However, this does not mean
                                we should supply it unless it can be used effectively. The greatest
                                effectiveness would be achieved by accelerating the training and
                                equipping of the Civil Guard and the Self Defense Corps if ways can
                                be found to do this-a very difficult problem. Increased economic aid
                                at the village level would produce the greatest impact on the
                                security situation.</p>

                                discussed above, and the conclusion drawn against this action. The

                                of U.S. real determination to stay with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in its fight”. On the other hand, negotiation of
                                such a treaty would represent a direct violation of Article 19 of
                                the Geneva Accords, and ratification by the U.S. Senate would be
                                time consuming at best.</p>

                                <item>First, while not minimizing the need for coordinated,
                                    evaluated intelligence at the national level, it strikes me that
                                    the most urgent need is for development of an extensive net in
                                    the villages, feeding into the Province Chiefs. The province
                                    organization seems to me to be the lowest level at which you can
                                    expect quick local reaction-if the <gloss target="#t_SDC1">SDC</gloss> and the Civil Guard can be organized to react.
                                    Since Diem insists on authority being retained by the Provincial
                                    Chiefs, why don’t we try to turn this necessity of dealing with
                                    them into a virtue, and help these officers do a better job? To
                                    my mind, this flows logically from a conviction expressed
                                    previously that the battle will be won or lost primarily at the
                                    village level. So let’s all get down on our bellies to fight the
                                    problem from the bottom up rather than entire concentration from
                                    the top on down. For years we have been trying unsuccessfully to
                                    “reform” the system at the top, while virtually ignoring the
                                    “rice roots”. We’ve been erecting various “scare crows” as
                                    deterrents to certain kinds of threats, while the gophers have
                                    had a field day building underground runways, multiplying, and
                                    gnawing away at the roots.</item>

                                    to their work. For example, Captain Easterling of the Navy
                                    Section, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, should have the

                                    should be instructed on the need for an intense intelligence
                                    effort and channels should be established for relaying this
                                    information to the Evaluation Center.</item>

                                Provinces.</hi></p>
                            <p>I am strongly in favor of this, because it fits with my “village
                                battle” concept. I think it must be done very carefully-not with the
                                attitude of an “inspector general” listing all the faults of the
                                Province Chief and his organization, but as a friendly, constructive
                                listing of what each Province Chief needs to do his job better. The
                                fact that there are some Province Chiefs who have done excellent
                                jobs is proof that it can be done. I trust that these successful
                                tactics and techniques can be transplanted. I would hope the survey
                                teams could study and be briefed on these tactics before they
                                undertake their surveys. The composition of these survey teams is,
                                of course, something to be decided locally, but if I were doing it,
                                I would not send large delegations. Ideally, a team should be one
                                U.S. officer and one <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. At
                                maximum, it should be two of each in the military and intelligence
                                fields. One team should be sent to each Corps area. Later, if the
                                results are favorable, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and
                                    <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> people could visit the
                                provinces.</p>
                            <p>After the surveys, we should “break our back” to supply what is
                                needed. If we could get a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                                advisor to the Civil Guard and an intelligence man assigned at each
                                Province Chief level, I think it would greatly facilitate an effort
                                from the bottom up. It may be a problem to find 38 French speaking
                                officers of each type, but I think the effort should be made-perhaps
                                by sending present <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers
                                out to the field on these jobs and replacing them with fresh
                                officers from <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>.</p>

                            <p>Any program of assistance to South Viet Nam must take into
                                consideration that country’s internal political situation and its
                                administrative structure. This is true for two reasons: first,
                                because the pressures now at work appear certain to erupt into
                                demands for a change, whether by means of a coup or through some
                                less drastic method. Second, there is good reason to think that
                                without some badly needed reforms, any program of military or
                                economic aid from the United States will be less than fully
                                effective.</p>
                            <p>This confronts the United States with a choice: to give its full
                                backing to President Diem and do what it can to frustrate any moves
                                to alter the present system; to stay neutral and hope that the
                                changes that come will be orderly and constructive; to encourage
                                changes that might be acceptable to both sides, i.e., the President
                                and his critics; to back administrative changes that would reduce
                                sharply the role of the President and his family in the day-to-day
                                conduct of governmental affairs; to back a coup that would remove
                                Diem from power.</p>
                            <p>The situation provides an opportunity for the United States to stand
                                once again for change in this part of the world, to press for
                                measures that are both efficient and more democratic. We must
                                identify ourselves with the people of Viet Nam and with their
                                aspirations, not with a man or an administration. We must do what we
                                can to help release the tremendous energy, ability and idealism that
                                exist in Viet Nam. We must suggest, not demand; we must advise, not
                                dictate; but we must not hesitate to stand for the things that we
                                and the Vietnamese know to be worthwhile and just in the conduct of
                                political affairs.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Present Situation.</hi></p>
                            <p>One after another, Vietnamese officials, military men and ordinary
                                citizens spoke to me of the situation in their country as “grave”
                                and “deteriorating”. They are distressed at the evidence of growing
                                Viet Cong successes. They have lost confidence in President Diem and
                                in his leadership. Men who only one or two months ago would have
                                hesitated to say anything critical of Diem, now explode in angry
                                denunciation of the man, his family, and his methods.</p>
                            <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0535"/>
                            <p>There is near paralysis in some areas of administration. Small
                                decisions that would be handled by minor officials in one of the
                                ministries of most governments are taken to the Presidency for
                                personal approval by Diem or one of his top advisers. Major
                                decisions sometimes go unconsidered for days or weeks. Ministers are
                                reduced to the role of expediters and “yes men”. Men with no
                                elective or even appointive office often have more influence and
                                power than the recognized officials.</p>
                            <p>Many men of intelligence and ability have been kept out of government
                                or been forced to resign if their complete loyalty to the President
                                came into doubt. The National Assembly has become a rubber stamp for
                                the President’s measures. Elections are a meaningless exercise that
                                can only produce contempt for the democratic process.</p>
                            <p>A chance remark in a cafe can produce a jail sentence. Those who
                                express political opposition are harassed. Men are held indefinitely
                                without indictment or even the placing of charges. One member of the
                                National Assembly has been in jail for almost a year without his
                                legislative immunity from arrest having been lifted.</p>
                            <p>The role of the President’s family is well-enough known to require
                                little elaboration. Brother Nhu holds power second only to that of
                                Diem himself. Brother Can rules the northern provinces like an
                                oriental satrapy from his base in Hue. Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_NDT1">Thuc</persName>, as the President’s elder, is
                                listened to respectfully by the President. Luyen, Ambassador in
                                London, returns to Saigon regularly to “mend his fences” and check
                                on his organization. Madame <persName corresp="#p_NDN2">Nhu</persName> presides over the women of South Viet Nam like
                                an Empress.</p>
                            <p>The activities of the brothers are a source of deep resentment among
                                people at every level. The Communists have used this resentment
                                skillfully in their propaganda against the regime. Many of the
                                allegations made against members of the Diem family are true; many
                                are false. What matters in this context is what is believed.</p>
                            <p>Intrigue, nepotism and even corruption might be accepted, for a time,
                                if combined with efficiency and visible progress. When they
                                accompany administrative paralysis and steady deterioration, they
                                become intolerable.</p>
                            <p>All of this has produced a steadily mounting demand for change. Even
                                persons long loyal to Diem and included in his official family now
                                believe that South Viet Nam can get out of the present morass only
                                if there is early and drastic revision at the top. They admit that a
                                series of dramatic political and military successes might-just
                                might-alter the present mood somewhat. But they see little or no
                                chance for that kind of success unless the Government’s
                                decision-making and administrative apparatus is reorganized
                                first.</p>
                            <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0536"/>
                            <p>The Vietnamese would like to see this kind of change come peacefully
                                and with U.S. encouragement. There are many who believe, in fact,
                                that it can come peacefully only if it is urged by the U.S.
                                Government. If change does not come in an orderly way, it will
                                almost certainly come through forceful means carried out by an
                                alliance of political and military elements.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">The Dangers</hi></p>
                            <p>It is obvious that the present tense situation could produce violence
                                and a period of serious internal confusion. It could divide the Army
                                as well as the bureaucratic machine. The Communists can be expected
                                to move swiftly in any such situation, combining military with
                                political moves aimed at a quick takeover. At best, an attempted
                                coup that failed would produce retaliation that would deprive Viet
                                Nam further of some of its best brains and talents.</p>
                            <p>The United States would face a serious dilemma should violence erupt.
                                Given the large and growing U.S. involvement in Viet Nam, we would
                                almost certainly have to intervene directly. This would produce
                                resentment on one side or the other, perhaps both, and would expose
                                us to large-scale criticism in other countries.</p>
                            <p>These are dangers, too, in the continuation of the present uneasy
                                situation. It means appalling waste in terms of energy, ability, and
                                patriotism. The prevailing administrative stagnation means that any
                                new program of aid will be less than fully effective. It means, too,
                                that the U.S. becomes increasingly identified with an unpopular and
                                ineffective regime.</p>

                            <p>The arguments in favor of change, almost any change, are impressive.
                                The situation in South Viet Nam is far too serious to permit that
                                country the luxury of depriving itself of any of its available
                                skills, intelligence, imagination, and hope. Those committed to
                                helping the Vietnamese in this critical hour have an equal interest
                                in seeing that everything that can contribute to victory is
                                done.</p>

                                        be overcome in gaining Montagnard help. The Communists got
                                        to them first, years ago. Communist hard-core political
                                        cadres have been living as tribal members in Montagnard
                                        villages, at least since 1954. It is estimated that 1700
                                        Montagnards in the II Corps area alone have been recruited
                                        by the Viet Cong. The Vietnamese have looked upon the
                                        Montagnards as something almost sub-human, and this is known
                                        to the Montagnards. On the other hand, the Viet Cong need

                                        has expressed concern at the further depletion of Vietnamese
                                        divisions to obtain manpower for special units, such as
                                        ranger companies. Since special units are manned by
                                        volunteers, the drain is in the best manpower, of quality as
                                        well as quantity. Divisions which have personnel most
                                        familiar with the border terrain are presently stationed in
                                        the High Plateau, have the mission of border area defense
                                        now, and would be needed to back up any frontier force which
                                        would operate as rangers on extended patrols.</item>

                                        of the border and by disrupting the enemy’s lines of

                                        patrols. Pacification will employ techniques of attracting

                                        employed successfully before in Vietnam. Pacification

                                        collection, initiating governmental services and control,
                                        then training and arming the villages for self-defense. When
                                        an area is secure, the Force will move into the next area
                                        for pacification operations, and continue doing so until all
                                        Vietnamese territory in the Frontier zone is secure.</item>

                                meet the Communist threat adequately, the U.S. needs a way of action
                                short of war but more dynamic than merely the bolstering of
                                peacetime measures. The situation in Viet-Nam cries for something
                                better than what we have been doing. So, my recommendation was that
                                the U.S. find the way to declare and support a sub-limited war in
                                Vietnam. This can be done by Presidential proclamation, a
                                Congressional supporting act, and a new streamlined organization
                                within the Executive, headed by a Presidential Assistant to upgrade
                                its authority and decisiveness.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">U.S. Collaborators-Advisors</hi>. The heavy
                                bureaucratic machinery of the Vietnamese government is not working
                                effectively. Heeding the lesson of Laos, where some U.S. military
                                are living and working with the <gloss target="#t_RLA1">RLA</gloss>
                                as a friendly encadrement, the U.S. should apply an <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0545"/>improved version in Vietnam. There
                                should be a U.S. political-psychological-military-economic
                                encadrement in Vietnam. The concept is of a U.S. team with its own
                                chief and its own radio communications to all U.S. elements in
                                Vietnam. Individual Americans would act as advisor-collaborators at
                                the key decision points in the top of the Vietnamese government.
                                Military-civilian teams would work with Vietnamese organizations at
                                critical trouble spots in the field. When one trouble spot is
                                cleared up, the field team can be moved to the next trouble area.
                                The work in a trouble spot would be what the Vietnamese call
                                pacification; this means that the military establishes physical
                                security, with civic action (health, welfare, information,
                                education, etc.) teams following on the heels of the troops.
                                Self-defense is organized and activated. When the area is secure,
                                (able to defend itself against all but large enemy units) the U.S.
                                team moves out. Vietnamese forces encadred can either be transferred
                                to the next trouble zone or be released for other duties.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Northwest Frontier Force</hi>. The border zone of
                                Laos is now an area of Viet-Cong infiltration into Viet-Nam from the
                                Laos panhandle. To meet this, a Northwest Frontier Force (a ranger
                                force supported by air and civic action teams) should be created. It
                                will have a long-range patrol element to strike the Viet-Cong lines
                                of communication in Laos and a pacification (military-civilian) team
                                for the frontier zone inside Vietnam. Pacification areas will be
                                designed to fit inhabitants and terrain. Ranger teams, with prompt
                                civic action follow-up, will attract the support of Montagnard
                                tribes and establish a capability for self-defense. The teams will
                                then move to the next pacification area, and so continue until the
                                whole frontier zone is capable of resisting Viet-Cong infiltration
                                and is keeping the Vietnamese promptly informed of all Viet-Cong
                                activities in the area. U.S. encadrement will include Special Forces
                                (down to company level), Jungle Jim (to ensure effective air

                                who could be armed for self-defense (or game hunting). The hardwoods
                                in <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> are well located for
                                profitable exploitation; in fact, its lumber would have a ready
                                market in Viet-Nam as well as elsewhere; if desired, it could be a
                                joint operation with Vietnamese veterans. When large Viet-Cong
                                forces are met, precise intelligence would be given to the <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0546"/><gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> for a strike at the enemy. The lumbermen could

                            <p>Vietnam is dangerously far down the road to a Communist takeover,
                                against the will of its people. Since my visit last January, the
                                situation appears to have grown more critical, despite generous U.S.
                                help. President Diem believes that the key moment which will
                                determine the future is between now and Christmas.</p>
                            <p>As in any society under great stress, some cracks have appeared. The
                                most apparent one during our visit was the very human one of looking
                                for somebody else to blame for the situation. Big Minh’s rather
                                desperate comments to you were an example. This same type of comment
                                was prevalent in many other quarters, including some in which Big
                                Minh was the target. Mistrust, jealousy, and the shock of Communist
                                savagery have contributed to making a none-too-certain government
                                bureaucracy even more unsure of itself. Pride and self-protection
                                still cover this unsureness, but the cover is wearing thin.</p>
                            <p>Yet, what is happening is against the will of the people. Communist
                                terrorism has brought compliance; Communist assurance of victory has
                                induced hopelessness. This can be changed. Given the means to fight
                                back and some hope in the future of a Free Vietnam, the people will
                                start responding. With popular support, and with an infusion of new
                                spirit in the government and the armed forces, a turn can still be
                                made against what now looks like an inevitable Communist
                                takeover.</p>
                            <p>It is time that we in the free world got angry about what is
                                happening in Viet-Nam and about what is happening elsewhere in
                                Southeast Asia. With our anger, there should come a deep commitment
                                to stop the Communists in their tracks and hit back hard. Frankly,
                                there are a lot of Americans who are angry and are willing to be
                                committed to victory in this struggle. But, there is no place and no
                                means by which they can join up to strike a blow for liberty.
                                Certainly there are dedicated Americans in Viet-Nam now who would
                                like nothing better than to give the Communists a licking. They are
                                prevented from doing so by our self-imposed restrictions of a peace
                                time governmental machinery, made clumsy by its complexity, which
                                has been jury-rigged to meet a critical situation when it really
                                needed to be revamped to meet a new kind of war.</p>
                            <p>A new infusion of spirit is needed in Vietnam. With new spirit, the
                                way will be opened to defeat the Communists, even though the <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0547"/>way probably will be long
                                and hard. This spirit will come only through dedicated action. Both
                                the Vietnamese and the Americans need to be freed to undertake such
                                dedicated action</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">The U.S. Role</hi></p>
                            <p>A humanitarian task force of U.S. military to help in the flood areas
                                of Viet-Nam probably will result in enough psychological effect and
                                enough physical security in its zone of operation to delay the
                                Communist time-table. The Communists will be forced to change their
                                strategy and this takes time. Thus, it would be wise for us to
                                recognize that such a task force effort is a way of buying some
                                badly needed time. We then should determine how best to use the time
                                purchased at such great effort.</p>
                            <p>There is a valuable lesson to be learned from our experience in Laos.
                                Regardless of the political outcome, we did have a moment when
                                circumstances forced us to do the right thing in part, on the spot,
                                in the military sector. This right action was the encadrement of the
                                Lao armed forces with dedicated American advisors, who acted as
                                brotherly collaborators, and who had their own communications from
                                the field to headquarters, permitting realistic and knowledgeable
                                action to be taken by the U.S. military at each level and where
                                needed. If this had been done earlier, and in the political,
                                economic, and information sectors as well as the military, Laos
                                might well have stood up to the Communist attack and have made far
                                better use of all its resources.</p>
                            <p>Thus, in Vietnam, with the time bought by a humanitarian U.S.
                                military task force in the flood area, and by the continuing work of
                                the present U.S. organizations in Vietnam, we should phase in a
                                Vietnamese-American partnership for action against the Communists,
                                by a special and temporary encadrement. -It will take Americans who
                                are willing to stake all on the outcome, who know their tasks, and
                                who can act with great understanding in collaboration with the
                                Vietnamese.</p>
                            <p>This U.S. role requires acceptance by the Vietnamese, starting with
                                President Diem, and a new resolution of problems by the United
                                States. Both can be done, if we determine to do so. Applied
                                effectively in Vietnam, we will have found the means of meeting
                                similar Communist threats elsewhere. With proper psychological
                                preparation, including our firm intention of pulling out again as
                                soon as the threat has been overcome, this fuller U.S. role in
                                helping free nations remain free will give a new spark to freedom
                                throughout the world</p>

                            <p>The U.S. needs to declare a “sub-limited” war on the Communists in
                                Viet-Nam and then to wage it successfully. Since such an action is
                                not envisioned by our Constitution, a way of so doing must be found
                                which is consistent with our heritage. The most natural declaration
                                would be a proclamation by the President, which would state U.S.
                                objectives and clearly outline the principles of human liberty
                                involved. The U.S. Congress would vote support of these objectives
                                and principles. Implementing actions would then be carried out by
                                Executive Order.</p>
                            <p>The executive agency to carry out the President’s desires needs
                                realistic consideration. The agency must be able to devote all of
                                its time and energies to the task. It must be elevated high enough
                                to demand and get effective contributions from all U.S. entities,
                                including State and Defense, and be quickly responsive to the
                                Executive will. The present Task Forces have neither the stature nor
                                the permanent personnel required. It would be preferable to have a
                                small task force headed by a Presidential Assistant, with members
                                from each U.S. department and agency assigned to it full-time, with
                                its own channel of communication to the field, with complete control
                                of the budget to counter the emergency in the country involved, and
                                with a clear statement of its priorities in drawing on the men,
                                money, and materiel needed.</p>
                            <p>For Vietnam, after consideration of the needs elsewhere, such as
                                Berlin, a new Presidential Task Force would be created. It would
                                need small, streamlined counterparts, particularly in State and
                                Defense. It would need an active liaison unit at <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. In Vietnam, it should act
                                with Presidential authority under the general guidance of the
                                Ambassador, but with its own responsible chief. It would need a
                                small staff in Saigon to see that the U.S. effort is coordinated, to
                                provide an adequate war room for current knowledge of the situation,
                                and to ensure administrative and logistic support. The field group
                                should be looked upon as going into a new type of combat and be so
                                supported, including duty status, discipline, and recognition. In
                                Vietnam, it would be the operations task force.</p>
                            <p>Paper work between Washington and Saigon should be cut to a minimum.
                                An aircraft should be assigned at the Washington end, for quick
                                trips to Viet-Nam to get first-hand information and to cut down the
                                need for time in the field which would have to be devoted to
                                reporting and administration.</p>
                            <p>The operations task force field personnel would operate on two
                                levels. One is at the executive level; the other is at the local
                                trouble spot, such as the northwest frontier.</p>
                            <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0549"/>
                            <p>At the executive level, there should be an American collaborator at
                                each key position in the Vietnamese government where decisive
                                executive action is required. The American would give the firm
                                guidance of a friend to the Vietnamese official in that position,
                                with the American remaining very much in the background and
                                encouraging Vietnamese initiative.</p>
                            <p>Local trouble spots should be selected for special U.S. effort. The
                                most obvious ones today are the northwest frontier, the sea
                                frontier, and <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss>. There are
                                others, along the Cambodian border, in the Long Hai area, in the
                                center, and so on. Each requires unique treatment, with its own
                                local U.S. task force directed from the U.S. task force in Saigon,
                                with its own communications net, and with its own task goal which
                                would determine its term of deployment. If need be, priorities can
                                be assigned to trouble spots so that they can be cleaned up one by
                                one with the most effective U.S. team possible to concentrate on an
                                area.</p>
                            <p>While each trouble spot is somewhat different, the local task force
                                is conceived as having a local U.S. director. Under him would be a
                                military team, having an advisor-collaborator with the Vietnamese
                                division commander, a Special Forces team with each battalion, and a
                                Jungle Jim cell to guide Vietnamese air support to the division’s
                                operations. U.S. military intelligence, psychological warfare, and
                                civic action personnel would work at division level, to guide the
                                Vietnamese effort. A junior Foreign Service officer would be the
                                advisor-collaborator with each Vietnamese province chief in the
                                trouble area, and would be part of the U.S. communications net. In
                                each province, there would be … a <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> information officer to guide the Vietnamese
                                psychological operation and to direct the <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> information center if this is required to bolster
                                the Vietnamese effort, and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>
                                officers as needed to guide public health, public works, education,
                                and self-help programs.</p>
                            <p>There is a great deal already in existence in these trouble spots.
                                The local U.S. task force would mostly give it some dynamic spark
                                and direction. In the northwest frontier, this would include a
                                different attitude towards and use of the Montagnard tribes.</p>
                            <p>In Laos, Special Forces teams are relieved after six months duty in
                                the jungle. General Boyle is in full agreement with this policy,
                                although he believes that the teams in some of the more settled
                                areas could remain longer without relief. In Vietnam, the problems
                                are quite different. A special rest and rehabilitation center could
                                be established in Saigon or Nha Trang, where teams could rest up. In
                                an area such as the northwest frontier, personnel could be rotated
                                for duty with the reserve at Kontum after an extended jungle patrol.
                                It would be smart to establish a similar system for Vietnamese
                                combat forces.</p>
                            <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0550"/>
                            <p>The concept noted above would place American talents and spirit
                                directly into position to be most effective in Vietnam. It would
                                commit them to the action, since Americans would share the hazards
                                of the struggle. A U.S. communications net would bring American “can
                                do” into the Vietnamese scene in a way which could be decisive. Much
                                of the present Vietnamese bickering and hesitancy would disappear as
                                a new sense of direction is given them.</p>

                                presence of Americans favorably, if this is done correctly. Included
                                in “doing it correctly” would be an expression of President Diem’s
                                desire for such U.S. help, the individual Americans earning their
                                way by friendly devotion to unselfish duty, with exemplary behavior,
                                and a firm understanding of U.S. withdrawal to let the Vietnamese
                                run their own affairs once the emergency is over. U.S. actions would
                                speak louder than words in countering Communist propaganda.</p>
                            <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Prisoners</hi>. The handling of Communist
                                prisoners needs improvement. The present system has dangerous
                                aspects which weaken the psychological effort among the people and
                                against the enemy. Use of Puolo Condore, with its connotation of the
                                worst of French colonialism, is an example. The decision role of the
                                province chiefs is another example. After the rehabilitation period,
                                of 6-12 months, the province chief is asked if there are any other
                                charges against the prisoner, or can he be released? All too often,
                                the province chief, hearing that there is secret Communist
                                organization and training going on among the prisoners, simply
                                replies that the prisoner is too dangerous to be returned home. The
                                prisoner then settles down to a life where he doesn’t have to work
                                and where he is better fed than the soldiers. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> states that there are about
                                10,000 such Viet Cong prisoners held by the Vietnamese. The
                                Philippines’ experience with Huk prisoners and <gloss target="#t_EDCOR1">EDCOR</gloss> rehabilitation indicates that
                                much more can be done with Viet Cong prisoners.</p>
                            <p>c. <hi rend="italic">The Vietnamese Will to Resist</hi>. Viet Cong
                                terrorist methods have alienated the people deeply, although they
                                are too scared to show it unless given at least the hope of
                                security. So far, they haven’t been given such a hope by the
                                Vietnamese government and armed forces, except spottily. Too many
                                villagers are treated with equal suspicion by both sides in this
                                struggle; the Communists cut off heads, while the Army keeps people
                                for days of interrogation away from supporting their families, once
                                information is given about Viet Cong activity. Improved relations
                                with the people, (such as a return to the “ten commandments”
                                formerly obeyed by the Vietnamese armed forces), <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0551"/>and improved military patrolling
                                backed by more responsive government work, should release the
                                expression of popular will: It would be actively anti-Communist.</p>
                            <p>Indicators of this popular will are many. The people of Phan Thiet
                                fed the marines five meals a day, voluntarily, during recent
                                operations when the marines undertook aggressive patrolling, and
                                offered to support them if they would stay. Catholic priests from
                                three different areas of the south became excitedly enthusiastic
                                when I asked them if there were youths in their villages who would
                                volunteer to fight the Communists; in their enthusiasm, they
                                promised to raise 20,000 volunteers quickly, if they could become
                                “fighters” and not “soldiers.” Americans working in the High Plateau
                                assured me that many of the Montagnards are desperately angry at the
                                Viet Cong and are ready to help in the fight if treated as men and
                                not as sub-human; President Diem noted a similar feeling of
                                Montagnard hatred of the Viet Cong from recent talks he has had with
                                French missionaries, (although he wants to regroup the Montagnards
                                into large settlements in the Malaya pattern).</p>
                            <p>The Viet Cong have broken the rules laid down by Mao Tse Tung for
                                success. This mistake needs to be exploited hard.</p>
                            <p>d. <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName></hi>. If the U.S. is to go into a fuller
                                effort for victory in Vietnam, one of the key people we will have to
                                bet a blue chip on is Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. As his stature and executive control have
                                grown, so have grown the suspicions that he is self-serving. Some of
                                the top officers in the armed forces, along with other government
                                officials, view him with distinct antipathy. Several are quite
                                active in “character assassination” of <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. Perhaps having an American collaborator

                                will tend to quiet the talk about him.</p>

                                “to get things done.” He has risen to his present position largely
                                on his own merit as an executive, with some help from Nhu and
                                against considerable opposition from Hue. His real ambition is not
                                known to me. When I have questioned him about his future hopes, he
                                has laughed and said that what he enjoys most is to travel and hopes
                                to earn the right to have leisure for so doing. However, he has
                                questioned me at times about Magsaysay, (who moved from Secretary of
                                Defense to the Presidency); such questioning always has been on how
                                Magsaysay acted as the civilian executive in military affairs, and
                                not on how he achieved political ends.</p>

                                ago), has improved, but he is complaining of back trouble. President
                                Diem has expressed concern about <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s back, explaining that he is suffering from
                                “minor <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0552"/>fractures of the
                                back-bone” and is under medical care. Continuing U.S. medical
                                assistance for <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> is
                                indicated.</p>
                            <p>Some relief from his multiple duties also is indicated for <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>. He is already acting to
                                overcome this problem, by pushing for the creation of an Executive
                                Council for National Security and by appointing more competent
                                assistants. The latter action is complicated by the political
                                connections of some less-competent assistants, but <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> is moving decisively to weed
                                them out and to appoint officials to whom he can entrust further
                                responsibilities.</p>
                            <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s continuing worry is
                                about the competence of the military commanders. This is an area of
                                concern where an American collaborator could do much constructive
                                work, in clearing up misunderstandings and in working intimately
                                with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> to strengthen the command
                                structure into real effectiveness. When asked about military
                                leadership, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> rattled off
                                a fast comment about many individuals; the following are his
                                personal views: <list>
                                    <item>Colonel Nguyen Duc Thang—the coming military leader, he
                                        fights and also knows how to run things; a future chief of
                                        staff. Good background in science and math. Very dedicated
                                        man. Marches on foot when he leads his troops. A moral man
                                        who doesn’t worship money or playing around.</item>
                                    <item>General Ty-a figurehead.</item>
                                    <item>General “Big” Minh-always complaining, and doesn’t take
                                        action when he has the opportunity; his plans never seem to
                                        be complete; he does such things as send airborne troops
                                        into combat by truck when air envelopment would be more
                                        effective.</item>
                                    <item>General “Little” Minh-intelligent, very smart, but hard to
                                        understand.</item>
                                    <item>Joint General Staff-very good, as playboys.</item>
                                    <item>General Don-an excellent staff officer who is misplaced in
                                        combat command.</item>
                                    <item>General Ding-zero, no good.</item>
                                    <item>General <persName corresp="#p_LVK1">Kim</persName>-good
                                        staff officer.</item>
                                    <item>Neum, III Corps-gets his old division, has a few tricks,
                                        don’t like him.</item>
                                    <item>Colonel Khiem, CO 21st Division-good, but a little lazy;
                                        he is not truly a partisan of the offense, because he likes
                                        fortifications.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The three coming men are the Airborne Commander, the Marines
                                Commander, and Colonel Thang.</p>
                            <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Chinese Nationalists</hi>. There have been some
                                private exchanges between President Diem and Generalissimo <persName corresp="#p_CK1">Chiang</persName> on the possible use of
                                Chinese Special Forces type of personnel in Vietnam. The exchange of
                                views apparently have given full consideration to the political
                                hazards in undertaking such an action, so they have been treated
                                sensitively and with some slowness. The present thinking is <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0553"/>for a group of about 200
                                veterans, ages 35-400, to come into Viet-Nam as Vietnamese, being
                                “sheep-dipped” in Cholon and given Vietnamese names. They will train
                                village Self Defense Corps in handling weapons, patrol actions, and
                                intelligence reporting. The idea is under study at present,
                                presumably requiring U.S. approval before being undertaken.</p>
                            <p>Some thought might be given to “human defoliation” in an area such as
                                    <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss>. The timber in this
                                jungle contains valuable hardwoods. If the timber concession was let
                                to Chinese Nationalists, say a commercial firm which was composed of
                                veterans who volunteered for the task, the “fire-break” plan of
                                sectoring <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> might be carried
                                out at minimal cost, with a politically-acceptable introduction of
                                Chinese Nationalists, and with definite benefit to both the welfare
                                and morale of Chinese veterans in Taiwan. A small Vietnamese unit
                                could be attached to such an outfit, as “protection” to give proper
                                commercial coloration to the venture. However, the <gloss target="#t_ChiNats1">ChiNats</gloss> should be sufficiently
                                armed for self-protection, which would include patrolling in the
                                vicinity of the lumber operation. The Vietnamese unit could forward
                                intelligence reports from this operation, as well as furnish
                                coordination when larger Viet Cong units were met and the Vietnamese
                                Armed Forces were needed for the strike at the enemy.</p>
                            <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Psychological Operations</hi>. Despite good
                                organizations and some dedicated Vietnamese and Americans in
                                psychological operations, it seems that the Communists still have
                                the psychological edge in the struggle in Vietnam. This is expressed
                                in terms of deep belief in inevitable victory, which is catching and
                                effective even among staunch anti-Communists. On the other hand,
                                given a real U.S. stiffening in Vietnam, a hope of victory, and
                                better yet, the hope of lifting the yoke of Communism from their
                                brothers in North Vietnam, the Vietnamese would catch fire, as would
                                many others in Asia and elsewhere in the world.</p>

                            <p>An immediate improvement can be made by closer U.S. collaboration
                                with the Vietnamese to get some joint mutual themes and then to
                                exploit them thoroughly, with U.S. help. This feeling was expressed
                                informally in a meeting with the U.S. Psychological Sub-Committee of
                                the Task Force, with general agreement of those present-all of whom
                                would like to see more follow-through and better means of operating.
                                Vietnamese government actions often need much more thorough planning
                                and exploitation, which present joint efforts do not satisfy.</p>
                            <p>In day-to-day work, there is a continuing theme of Viet Cong excesses
                                in behavior which can be exploited to damage Communist political
                                claims. At the same time, there are many constructive actions by the
                                Vietnamese which need much fuller exploitation, <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0554"/>including recognition of
                                individuals and organizations. However, there are equipment and use
                                needs which require expedited action.</p>

                                        US commitment to the ground and other forces would be made
                                        ready. It is not a temporary commitment; without the
                                        “8000-man force”, the recommendations will not save South
                                        VietNam; with it, they might.</p>
                                    <p>Small actions without words are not necessarily useful. There
                                        should be a commitment with the introduction of a US force,
                                        we need a clear objective to plan properly. Tell the world
                                        and the US what our commitment really is; the “8000-man
                                        force” does not convince anyone of our resolve. In Laos, our
                                        objective was never understood. The objective should be in a

                                        unlimited action. Why wait on going at Hanoi? Maybe USSR

                                        are making a full commitment. If we make such a full

                                        creditable-we should move fast. A larger force is

                                        the limited actions recommended by General Taylor, surface
                                        the Jorden paper with necessary follow-up, then look to
                                        Hanoi. The Vice President’s trip and the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission lay on the

                                        There is no soft option. Hanoi and Peking have basic
                                        weaknesses which lessen the risk to US action.</p>

                        <p>The essence of the discussion revolved around whether the United States
                            should make a “Berlin-type commitment” to South VietNam, and it was
                            agreed that discussion with the President should focus on this basic
                            question. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> took the
                            position that, if this decision were made, Defense could cope “with the
                            problem of forces”. It was also agreed that, if this decision were made,
                            the question of whether, when and how to introduce American forces would
                            much more easily fall into place. There was little enthusiasm for the
                            concept that, by introducing American forces for flood relief purposes,
                            we would thereby retain greater flexibility and be able more readily to
                            withdraw our forces if we decided to go no further. There was also
                            concern over introducing and involving our forces in the delta area,
                            where conditions are most difficult for the effective combat deployment
                            of American forces.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> recalled that following the

                            him to draft a memorandum directed toward the question <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> raised at the meeting, namely
                            whether the United States should make a clear “Berlin-type” commitment
                            to Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> said that the
                            draft memorandum, which he finished on Sunday, November 8, was sent to
                            the President only after “extensive discussions” with the Joint Chiefs
                            and other Defense Department officials and with “important revisions in
                            the last part.” (Unpublished <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> memoirs, Chapter IV, pp. 24-2S) For text of the

                                    Success will depend on <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0562"/>factors many of which are not within our control-notably the

                                    remain a major problem. The domestic political implications of
                                    accepting the objective are also grave, although it is my own
                                    feeling that the country will respond better to a firm initial

                                    gradually, and that in the meantime are sure to involve
                                    casualties. The over-all effect on Moscow and Peiping will need
                                    careful weighing and may well be mixed; however, permitting

                        <p>On November 5, 1961, Indian Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Jawaharlal Nehru</persName> and a party including his daughter

                                Desai</persName> arrived in the United States for a 10-day visit.
                            Briefing papers for the visit, including an undated position paper on
                            Vietnam, NIN D-14, prepared by the Department of State, are in

                            November 3, offering suggestions on the talks with Nehru. The Acting
                            Secretary made the following comments regarding Southeast Asia, which he
                            said was possibly “the most important single question” the President
                            would discuss with Nehru: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“You might consider broadening the discussion by pointing out the
                                    grave decision you personally might be called upon to make in
                                    the coming months with the weakening situation in Vietnam, the
                                    great uncertainties in Laos, and potential instability in
                                    Thailand.</p>
                                <p>“Naturally, you hesitate to think of committing major troops to
                                    this area, and you would give everything in the world to avoid
                                    it if possible in this era of nuclear weapons when a local war
                                    can quickly spread and intensify.</p>
                                <p>“Yet if the Chinese should move into this region, the whole of
                                    Southeast Asia would be opened up from Australia to the east and
                                    India to the west. and this would be hard for us to accept.</p>

                                <p>“Can the Prime Minister think of any way to achieve a new power
                                    balance in the area that would relieve us of our present direct
                                    confrontation with the Communists which we did not seek and do
                                    not want?</p>
                                <p>“With that opening, it is conceivable that the possibility of a
                                    neutral and independent Southeast Asia, guaranteed by India
                                    together with the Soviet Union and the United States, and for
                                    the record, at least, by China, might emerge naturally out of
                                    the discussion.</p>
                                <p>“If not, it might be worthwhile to consider opening this subject
                                    yourself. In my opinion, a settlement in Laos is very nearly
                                    meaningless unless we can find some way to create stability in
                                    Vietnam. If the latter situation deteriorates much further,
                                    Thailand is almost certain at some point to make her own
                                    adjustments with Peking, and this could turn our present
                                    position into a shambles and present us with an ugly and
                                    dangerous choice.”</p>

                                    put down Communist terror. Could Ho Chi Minh do anything? The

                                    do? Nehru was rather negative on all of these matters and most
                                    interested in making clear that we should not send in soldiers.
                                    I agree heartily but we need an alternative with a plausible

                            has occurred here in interval of one month since exchange reftels. In
                            first place, security situation has markedly deteriorated in terms of
                            increased incidents and lack of noteworthy government victories and,
                            above all, in effects of these retrograde developments on public and
                            official morale. In this situation, special mission of General Taylor
                            has tended bring situation here to a head more rapidly than anticipated.
                            Government and people of VietNam, and especially military forces, now
                            expect major underwriting by US. Public expectation has developed, on
                            basis largely of hope, to such extent that failure on part US to make
                            major new commitments here would, I fear, cause rapid deterioration
                            present unsatisfactory situation and collapse of morale.</p>
                        <p>I heartily endorse the six recommendations which General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> sent from here (Embtels 536 and
                                544<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">Telegram 536 is printed as <ref target="#d190">Document 190</ref>. Telegram 544 is not
                                printed.</note>). Nevertheless, I am sure that neither he nor you
                            will be under any illusions as to formidable obstacles to implementing
                            some of them. You will note that several of the six points are
                            procedural, involving better utilization existing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> resources and development better
                            techniques, with our help. These recommendations hit the principal spots
                            where improvements should and can be made, but I caution against
                            assumption that miracles can be worked here in field of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> organization for two reasons: severe
                            shortage of capable, trained, cooperative-minded people with a will to
                            national unity, and the personality of President Diem. Nevertheless, we
                            have made some, and can make further improvements in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> organization, and under the pressure of
                            present emergency Diem speaks as if he is willing to allow us to become
                            more intimately involved in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> plans
                            and their execution. We should certainly make best use this
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Main new substantive US contributions recommended in <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s six points are: (1) three
                            helicopter squadrons (63 helicopters) to give much-needed mobility to
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces especially in vicinity of
                            Laotian border, and (2) US military task force to do job of
                            rehabilitation flooded provinces of Mekong Delta. With respect to (1),
                            it is clear that if these helicopters are to be useful in time, American
                            pilots and maintenance crews are required.</p>

                        <p>As valuable and necessary as I consider these two additional US
                            contributions to be, and without them I think there is likely to be a
                            collapse of morale and/or a military coup d’etat here, I am not sure
                            that these commitments, coupled with other actions undertaken and
                            planned, will be sufficient for the long run. I would expect the
                            Communists to react by increasing the tempo and strength of their
                            campaign within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, by heavier
                            infiltrations into central Viet-Nam and perhaps also in the delta, thus
                            attempting to discredit US military presence here. In final analysis, in
                            order to win we may have to force Communist side to conclude that
                            further attempt to take this country by introduction of force from
                            outside will be met direct US action against North VietNam. I think the
                            steps recommended by General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> are necessary now, but I wanted you to have my
                            private and personal assessment as you consider them.</p>

                            policy.]</p>
                        <p>Turning to another subject, the President acknowledged the importance
                            India places in its geographic situation in relation to its foreign
                            policy. He also recalled that the United States had been neutralist for
                            a long time. Nevertheless he wanted to say that we would like India to
                            oppose us on issues when we were wrong and to support us on those
                            occasions when we might be right. The Prime Minister welcomed the
                            opportunity afforded by this comment to explain the Indian approach to
                            international issues. Indians naturally seek to act on the merit of each
                            matter, the Prime Minister said, but <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0567"/>he attaches importance to the manner of approach as
                            well. He wants to create the feeling that India wants to be friendly and
                            wants to cooperate with other nations even though it does not
                            necessarily agree with each of them on a particular point. It is not a
                            question of finding a midway position between the United States and the
                            Soviet Union; that would have no meaning, really. The worst of the cold
                            war is that it makes everyone rigid in mind and in spirit and so it
                            becomes difficult for either side to deal with the other side. If the
                            way to war is obstructed, then a feeling will come that matters can be
                            dealt with in other ways, and the approach becomes easier.</p>
                        <p>The President described the foreign policy of the United States as, of
                            course, to support countries with democratic systems, but even more
                            basically to support national sovereignty. Sometimes this means,
                            unhappily, that we support governments not fully supported by their own
                            people. Yet it is not always easy to withdraw. In some places we believe
                            that if we should withdraw communism might take over by subversion. This
                            is the problem that faces us; we don’t object when communists take over
                            by electoral means as Jagan did in British Guiana.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked why communism has an appeal to many people.
                            Mainly, he felt, it develops in poor and underdeveloped countries. The
                            President pointed out that in many areas communism takes over by force
                            and subversion. The Prime Minister agreed that no one would view with
                            approval terroristic tactics, adding, however, that military actions
                            bring unfortunate results. The very act of meeting a situation
                            militarily may make it worse. For example, with the help of United
                            States forces a situation may be cleared but it is very likely that the
                            position of the leaders then becomes weaker because of their dependence
                            on an outside power. Thus the problem is not settled.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> explained that
                            we are faced with a situation in which we are making efforts to settle
                            the Laos problem but at the same time there are serious attacks on South
                            Vietnam, some of them via Laos. If these should succeed, it would look
                            as if by our willingness to negotiate on Laos we had lost both Laos and
                            Vietnam. That would discredit our efforts and make it impossible for us
                            to negotiate on other issues, including Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> interjected
                            that several members of this Administration have had the view that truly
                            neutral countries offer opportunities for us to help economically to
                            build them up. If in Laos or in any other country neutralism becomes
                            merely a stage which precedes a communist takeover then the whole
                            concept of neutralism will become a stench in the nostrils. The question
                            is what India and other countries can do about this.</p>
                        <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0568"/>
                        <p>Agreeing that there is a question of what to do, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NJ1">Nehru</persName> observed that the whole idea in
                            the Geneva Conference of 1954 was to create international commissions to
                            meet this situation. To some extent it has been the failure to live up
                            to these commitments that has led to later difficulties. If the
                            commissions had not been there he was convinced that trouble would have
                            come much sooner in Vietnam. In Laos, indeed, trouble did come after the
                            commission was closed down. These things don’t always happen according
                            to plans or our decision. We can affect them sometimes but not always.
                            The Prime Minister said he realized the position of the United States is
                            difficult because the United States is tied up in many matters from
                            which it is difficult to come out.</p>
                        <p>On Laos the President said that the United States will try to persuade
                            the three Princes to come together promptly, in this month of November.
                            But, he added, we don’t want our efforts in Laos to end in a collapse in
                            South Vietnam.</p>

                            govt, but not to extent set forth pares 1 and 2 reftels, which would in
                            his view amount to divesting himself of key instruments of power.</p>
                        <p>I believe Diem can be persuaded to create and use a National Emergency
                            Council (or some similar executive organ), but probably only if chaired
                            by his brother Nhu. Vice President <persName>Tho</persName> would in all
                            probability be a member of this council and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> would probably be its Secretary. I do not think
                            Diem could be persuaded to place a US member on the Council “to
                            participate in all decisions”. This <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0569"/>step would, I think, be interpreted by him and by most
                            Vietnamese as handing over Govt of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                            to US.</p>
                        <p>On military side, I do not believe Diem can be persuaded to delegate
                            complete authority to anyone, but I do think he can be induced to take a
                            less direct part in military operational matters. Re intelligence
                            unification, I think this can be achieved, and we are on way towards it

                        <p>Re para 2 A, B, C, D and <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 550,
                            believe we can make progress in these areas if President Diem accepts
                            the type National Emergency Council indicated above.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, our best bet is to continue to press for improvements in
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> governmental efficiency and
                            popular appeal by backing Pres Diem, using the confidence we have gained
                            to persuade him in the directions we want, utilizing his own Vietnamese
                            advisors to this end, but never giving him grounds to believe that we
                            are trying to undercut his constitutional position or to reduce his
                            overall prestige and authority.</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George W. Ball</persName> met with President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> on November 7, 1961, to discuss
                            a subject not related to Vietnam. At the end of that meeting, according
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, they discussed Vietnam:

                                <p>“I told him that I strongly opposed the recommendations of the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> mission. To
                                    commit American forces to South Viet-Nam would, in my view, be a
                                    tragic error. Once that process started, I said, there would be
                                    no end to it. ‘Within five years we’ll have three hundred
                                    thousand men in the paddies and jungles and never find them
                                    again. That was the French experience. Viet-Nam is the worst
                                    possible terrain both from a physical and political point of
                                    view.’ To my surprise, the President seemed quite unwilling to
                                    discuss the matter, responding with an overtone of
                                        asperity:’<persName>George</persName>, you’re just <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0570"/>crazier than hell. That

                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> for
                            his thoughts on how it might be possible to reverse the trend in Viet
                            Nam from its present slippery downward slope. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> said, after some thought, the
                            basic thing was to have in South Viet Nam a regime-the present one or
                            another-that would be non-Communist, though not necessarily
                            anti-Communist; the regime should be interested in economic development;
                            and it should be willing to agree to a continued separation of North and
                            South Viet Nam. At present each regime in Viet Nam is threatening to
                            absorb the other.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> professed to be too out
                            of touch with South Viet Nam, which he had left in 1955, to have any
                            thoughts on any possible alternative to Diem. He characterized Diem as
                            sincere, courageous, self-centered, stubborn. He told a number of
                            anecdotes of his own contacts with Diem, not just from his position on
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. but as a disinterested advisor
                            to Diem. These stories illustrated <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0571"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName>’s
                            failure to convince Diem that he should subordinate everything to Diem’s
                            big problem, which was and is the enmity of the North Viet Nam regime.
                            For example, he had tried to persuade Diem to make his peace with Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> but Diem told him he
                            could not deal with such a madman. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> expressed his belief that Diem must be persuaded
                            to broaden the base of his government and evoke the assistance of other
                            South Vietnamese rather than merely to run the government for the
                            benefit of his own family.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> said he felt it was
                            important for us to take into account the objectives of the North
                            Vietnamese in considering steps we might take in Viet Nam. He gave his
                            analysis of North Vietnamese objectives, starting in 1954. He said at
                            that time Hanoi was willing that Laos and Cambodia be neutral because
                            Hanoi believed it would get South Viet Nam through political means,
                            especially by exploiting differences between ourselves and the French
                            and British.</p>
                        <p>During the period 1955 to 1958, Hanoi toyed with the Laotian situation
                            and used Laos as a bargaining point with regard to a settlement of its
                            relations with South Viet Nam. In 1958 he believed that Hanoi was
                            somewhat worried about Laos but nevertheless allowed a settlement
                            between Souvanna and the Pathet Lao. More recently our activities and
                            the succession of governments in Laos caused Hanoi to intervene actively
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> then moved to a
                            consideration of the effect of various moves that could be made with
                            regard to the Vietnamese situation. If a conference were to be held, the
                            immediate result would be a call for elections. He said he had advised
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> against the
                            United States using the conference approach to a settlement of the Viet
                            Nam situation. If a small number of U.S. troops were to be moved in, he
                            did not believe they would materially help the South Vietnamese. If a
                            large number of troops were to move in, it would upset the Laotian
                            situation and fighting would be renewed. Even if the U.S. ended up in
                            military occupation of South Viet Nam and Laos, where would we be?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> stressed the point that the fighting in
                            South Viet Nam was very severe and very dirty, and that some immediate
                            action appeared to us to be called for. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> dismissed the dirtiness of the fighting as an old
                            Vietnamese custom. He stressed that there was no immediate solution
                            available in Viet Nam, and that the problem was to work on Diem and
                            gradually to convince him of the necessity of changing his methods.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> also was asked for his
                            suggestions for immediate action. He said first to get the Laotian
                            settlement out of the way.</p>
                        <p>Second, we should get Diem to cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and to expose through the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to the world what was happening. He said that he had
                            received the Government of Viet Nam letter of October <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0572"/>24<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">Not
                                printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751K.00/11-861)</note>
                            from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> in
                            Geneva and that it was the first really well-documented case South Viet
                            Nam had made. He said that when he had learned in Delhi last month of
                            the protest from South Viet Nam on Col. Nam’s assassination, he had told
                            the Indian <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> representative to ask for
                            facts and that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> now had something
                            to work with. He said that with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            exposure it would be possible for the U.K. to press the U.S.S.R. to stop
                            what was going on.</p>
                        <p>Third, he suggested that there should be no settlement of the
                            reunification question while the war was going on. Mr.
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> asked him whether he thought the Viet
                            Minh would listen to the Soviet Union. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> replied indirectly by saying that the Vietnamese
                            hate the Chinese and always have. He predicted Hanoi would be Peiping’s
                            Yugoslavia in ten years. He suggested that it would be useful for Diem
                            to announce publicly three policies: (1) cooperation with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, (2) his determination to work for the
                            economic development of the country in peace and freedom, and (3) his
                            renunciation of force for the unification of the country. In short, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> said he should carry
                            the political offensive to the enemy’s camp.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conversation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> made the suggestion that South Viet Nam try to get
                            economic help from its fellow Asians in the Colombo Plan.</p>

                                    fairly rapid extension of Communist control, or complete

                                    the Orient, would be extremely serious.</item>

                                <item>The chances are against, probably sharply against, preventing
                                    the fall of South Viet-Nam by any measures short of the
                                    introduction of U.S. forces on a substantial scale.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If we commit combat forces to South VietNam, the ultimate possible extent
                            of our military commitment in Southeast Asia must be faced. The struggle
                            may be prolonged, and Hanoi and Peiping may overtly intervene. It is the
                            view of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff that, in
                            the light of the logistic difficulties faced by the other side, we can
                            assume that the maximum United States forces required on the ground in
                            Southeast Asia would not exceed six divisions, or about 205,000 men. It
                            is also the view of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff that our military posture is, or, with the addition of more
                            National Guard or regular Army divisions, can be made, adequate to
                            furnish these forces without serious interference with our present
                            Berlin plans.</p>
                        <p>While it is clear that, from the standpoint of South Viet-Nam alone, the
                            introduction of American combat forces into that country is most
                            desirable, it is not clear what effect this action might have on Laos if
                            this action is taken prior to a settlement with respect to that country.
                            It could have the effect of causing the Communists to break off
                            negotiations and renew their offensive in that country, thus requiring
                            us also to commit forces in Laos or to abandon that country to full
                            Communist control. While a fully satisfactory settlement with respect to
                            Laos does not now appear probable, it may be possible in the near future
                            to reach a settlement on the basis of a very weak and unsatisfactory

                            took prompt steps to halt their support of the Viet Cong. However, this

                            off chance that Hanoi decides to take over before we can react. We
                            cannot politically move into Laos right away, and we should try not to

                                <item>Scenario A: Diem takes heart and also takes the measures
                                    needed to improve efficiency, with only the 8000 man force and
                                    US specialist help. Hanoi heeds our warning and lays low, so
                                    that control is reasserted in South Vietnam. (Laos is a big
                                    question mark here and in other Scenarios.)</item>
                                <item>Scenario B: The struggle continues to go against Diem, and his
                                    own efforts at improvement are feeble. Thus, the US moves into
                                    the driver’s seat and eventually brings the situation under
                                    control, using forces on the scale of 25,000-75,000. Hanoi and
                                    Peiping do not intervene directly, and we do not attack
                                    Hanoi.</item>
                                <item>Scenario C: As the struggle becomes prolonged, the US strikes
                                    at Hanoi (or Hanoi and Peiping intervene overtly). The US wins
                                    the resulting conflict, i.e., obtains at least a restoration of
                                    the status quo, after inflicting such punishment on Hanoi and/or
                                    Peiping that further aggressive moves are forestalled for a long
                                    time to come.</item>

                                <item>Scenario X: The US decides not to put in the 8000 men, or
                                    later forces, and Diem is gradually overcome.</item>
                                <item>Scenario Y: The US puts in the 8000 men, but when Diem fails
                                    to improve his performance pulls out and lets him be
                                    overcome.</item>
                                <item>Scenario Z: Moscow comes to the aid of Hanoi and Peiping,
                                    supplying all necessary equipment (including a limited supply of
                                    air-deliverable nuclear weapons to retaliate in kind against US
                                    use) so <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0576"/>that the
                                    outcome is a stalemate in which great destruction is wreaked on
                                    the whole area.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>Of these, only A is truly a good outcome from all long-term
                                standpoints-it stiffens us generally vis-à-vis the Bloc, holds the
                                area (save perhaps Laos), does not discomfit us unduly in the
                                neutral world, excellent for domestic US will and drive. Only
                                trouble is-it’s unlikely! However, it is still so much better than
                                any other that it is worth accepting some added degree of difficulty
                                in achieving <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss> and C to give <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss> every chance to happen.</p>
                            <p>The choice between <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss> and C is a hard
                                one. Despite all our warnings and Jorden Report, our case of
                                aggression against Hanoi will not convince neutrals of its accuracy
                                and justice, or major allies of its wisdom and practicality. On the
                                other hand, <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss> is a road that has
                                almost no end in sight. The US is poorly cast as a permanent
                                protecting power, but the local capabilities would be so low at the
                                end of such a struggle that we would almost have to assume that
                                role. There is a very considerable chance that under continuing US
                                protection, South Viet-Nam and the area as a whole would become a
                                wasting asset and an eyesore that would greatly hamper all our
                                relations worldwide. On the whole, the short-term onus attached to C
                                may be preferable. However, as we play the hand toward C (especially
                                if we use Moscow as the channel to Hanoi) we may well raise the
                                chances of Moscow acting to bring on <gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>On the “bad” side, X and <gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss> are clearly
                                nightmares. Though X means loss of the area for a long time to come,
                                it is probably better in the long run than <gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss>. The chances of the Soviets acting to bring about
                                    <gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss> do not appear great in the short
                                run, but we must certainly try to keep those chances low (e.g., by
                                making our dealings with Moscow private).</p>
                            <p>Y is also a nightmare. It loses the area. Moreover, vis-a-vis the
                                Bloc it would be worse than X, since they would take it as an almost
                                final proof that we would not stand up. It might have some
                                compensating gains in the neutral world, at least in the short run.
                                But on the whole it seems the worst possible outcome.</p>

                                    Intervention in South Vietnam</hi></p>
                            <p>In deciding on the appropriate level of a possible US Intervention in
                                Vietnam, it is important to consider the objective of preserving
                                Vietnamese prestige. The preferred US outcome is for the Vietnamese,
                                and Diem, to get credit for the defeat of the Communists with the
                                help of the US. The next best outcome, a defeat of <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0577"/>the Communists as a consequence of
                                large scale intervention on the part of the US is a distinctly
                                inferior outcome to the former. Diem would very probably be
                                discredited and progress toward the formation of a cohesive nation
                                slowed.</p>
                            <p>The problem of a US take-over of the conflict hardly arises at the
                                6-8000 US troop level-especially if these troops are mostly
                                engineers. It would seem to arise only if the scale of intervention
                                is of the order of several divisions. (Even then the outcome of the
                                war would be very largely dependent on the Vietnamese effort.) The
                                introduction of a large US force may turn out to be necessary in any
                                case. This would be so if Hanoi and Peiping intervened openly or if
                                sizeable forces are needed in Laos. Short of such clear and urgent
                                demands for a large US force on the scene we should restrict our
                                effort to a level that leaves the burden primarily on the
                                Vietnamese. The US role would be (1) to assist South Viet-Nam more
                                actively in a variety of ways, and (2) to bail out the Vietnamese if
                                things go badly.</p>

                                    Rather, your report responds to a lesser scale objective, which
                                    can be altered up or down by later choice. There is advantage,
                                    however, in exploring the President’s view now on an ultimate

                                            is to remove all doubt as to the extent the US is

                                            assistance will then diminish rather than increase. In
                                            this context, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s interpretation of your

                                    <item><p>In order to implement your recommendations, it is
                                            necessary to violate the 1954 Geneva Accords, and to
                                            acknowledge such violation. Present thinking as to the
                                            use of the Jorden report envisages publication of a
                                            White paper, tabled at the United Nations, which will be
                                            publicly used as the excuse for such violation. We are
                                            thus announcing to the world a radical increase in our
                                            assistance to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                                            including placement there of a small American force.
                                            This will be a dramatic indication of our recognition of
                                            the vital interest <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
                                            represents to our own national security, and should be
                                            just as convincing to the “other side” whether we commit
                                            8,000 men or 80,000 men.</p>
                                        <p>It should be noted, however, that renunciation of the
                                            Accords (though we do so on the basis of the US
                                            reservation attached thereto) is a double-edged sword.
                                            The Communists are then free to invade. It is here that
                                            our commitment must be clear as a defense for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                                        <p>We do not envisage US units having a positive military
                                            objective, so it is difficult to see how our forces can
                                            become mired down in an inconclusive struggle. If their
                                            presence, in conjunction with other measures, increases
                                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> capabilities to
                                            fight, the Viet-Cong will become less able to engage
                                            them. If this anticipated result does not occur, a new
                                            US decision will be required.</p>

                                    <item>A public commitment to a maximum objective in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> seems unnecessary for the

                                        announcement were made it would decrease our flexibility and
                                        initiative. It is ironic that we continue to point with envy
                                        to the flexible and fluid tactics which <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> adherents follow and at

                                        similar advantages. The lack of such public announcement of
                                        our objectives does not, however, prevent the possibility of
                                        transmitting an appropriate <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0579"/>diplomatic warning to Hanoi that their

                        <p>The meeting to discuss Viet-Nam with the President, scheduled for
                            November 7, 1961, was apparently postponed. No record has been found of
                            such a meeting on that date, and the <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> Log Book, as well as the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Lemnitzer Appointment
                            Books, show no record of such a meeting. The reason for the apparent
                            postponement has not been determined, but may have been due to the
                            President’s heavy schedule of activities during the visit of Prime

                        <p>The meeting was rescheduled for November 8, 1961, but that too was
                            postponed. According to a memorandum of a telephone conversation between

                        <p>In the light of our discussion last night,<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2"><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s journal
                                shows that he left the Pentagon at 5:40 p.m. with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to attend a meeting at

                                record of this meeting was found.</note> it is clear that there is
                            great concern that the actions we take in the immediate future in South
                            Viet-Nam will disrupt the possibility of a Souvanna settlement,
                            including signature of Geneva agreements, which might otherwise be
                            expected to take place within about a month. I think we must recognize
                            that even the installation of a Souvanna government will not by any
                            means eliminate the possibility of our having to take early action in
                            Laos; the hope, however, is that such action would be in response to
                            some breach of the situation by the other side. Otherwise, our political
                            difficulties would be greatly multiplied-as they would be if our
                            introduction of added elements into the Viet-Nam situation were blamed
                            for upsetting the possibilities of a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Some of our discussion last night tended to assume that introduction of
                            an 8000-man force (or some such number) would be a decisive event in
                            determining reactions in Laos. I doubt if it is as <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0581"/>black-and-white as this, and of course
                            we must reckon that anything we say to Diem may lead in some way to
                            reactions. What we need, however, is a very careful look at the
                            successive military actions that we might take under the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report recommendations, the
                            timing of these, their degree of visibility, and whether there is any
                            way to frame plausible cover stories that would enable us to move forces
                            into position without upsetting the apple cart. For example, the
                            8000-man force might be labelled as a reinforcement for Honolulu, or
                            engaged in an exercise in the Philippines. In this connection, the use
                            of an existing divisional staff organization, while surely much more
                            efficient, may raise serious problems of publicity.</p>
                        <p>Could you look into these matters in a preliminary fashion and give me

                                    accommodation to Communism, in the rest of mainland Southeast
                                    Asia and in Indonesia. The strategic implications worldwide,

                                    various measures proposed by him short of this are useful but
                                    will not in themselves do the job of restoring confidence and
                                    setting Diem on the way to winning his fight.</item>

                                <item>The introduction of a U.S. force of the magnitude of an
                                    initial 8,000 men in a flood relief context will be of great
                                    help to Diem. However, it will not convince the other side
                                    (whether the shots are called from Moscow, Peiping, or Hanoi)
                                    that we mean business. Moreover, it probably will not tip the
                                    scales decisively. We would be almost certain to get
                                    increasingly mired down in an inconclusive struggle.</item>

                                <item>The other side can be convinced we mean business only if we
                                    accompany the initial force introduction by a clear commitment
                                    to the full objective stated above, accompanied by a warning
                                    through some channel to Hanoi that continued support of the Viet
                                    Cong will lead to punitive retaliation against North

                                    military commitment must be faced. The struggle may be prolonged
                                    and Hanoi and Peiping may intervene overtly. In view of the
                                    logistic difficulties faced by the other side, I believe we can
                                    assume that the maximum U.S. forces required on the ground in
                                    Southeast Asia will not exceed 6 divisions, or about 205,000 men

                                    National Guard or regular Army divisions, can be made, adequate
                                    to furnish these forces without serious interference with our

                                <item>To accept the stated objective is of course a most serious
                                    decision. Military force is not the only element of what must be
                                    a most carefully coordinated set of actions. Success will depend
                                    on factors many of which are not within our control-notably the
                                    conduct of Diem himself and other leaders in the area. Laos will
                                    remain a major problem. The domestic political implications of
                                    accepting the objective are also grave, although it is our
                                    feeling that the country will respond better to a firm initial
                                    position than to courses of action that lead us in only
                                    gradually, and that in the meantime are sure to involve
                                    casualties. The over-all effect on <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0583"/>Moscow and Peiping will need careful weighing
                                    and may well be mixed; however, permitting South Viet-Nam to
                                    fall can only strengthen and encourage them greatly.</item>

                            the light of the logistic difficulties faced by the other side, we can
                            assume that the maximum United States forces required on the ground in
                            Southeast Asia would not exceed six divisions, or about 205,000 men.
                            This would be in addition to local forces and such <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> forces as may be engaged. It is
                            also the view of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            that our military posture is, or, with the addition of more National
                            Guard or regular Army divisions, can be made, adequate to furnish these

                        <p>It must be understood that the introduction of American combat forces
                            into Viet-Nam prior to a Laotian settlement would run a considerable
                            risk of stimulating a Communist breach of the cease fire and a
                            resumption of hostilities in Laos. This could present us with a choice
                            between the use of combat forces in Laos or an abandonment of that
                            country to full Communist control. At the present time, there is at
                            least a chance that a settlement can be reached in Laos on the basis of
                            a weak and unsatisfactory <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna

                            to stabilize the position both in Viet-Nam and in Laos by registering
                            our determination to see to it that the Laotian settlement was as far as
                            the U.S. would be willing to see Communist influence in Southeast Asia
                            develop.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Use of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and Geneva Conference Procedures</hi></p>
                        <p>The question naturally arises whether Viet-Nam can be settled through the
                            use of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and a resort to a
                            Geneva-type conference in an effort to find a negotiated settlement. The
                            dangers in this procedure are very high, if our objective is to prevent
                            a serious increase in Communist influence in Southeast Asia. South
                            Viet-Nam resulted from the partition of Viet-Nam and represents that
                            portion which is entitled to be free from Communist penetration or
                            control. To embark upon a course of negotiation with the Sino-Soviet
                            Bloc would acknowledge that the Communists are entitled to negotiate
                            about South Viet-Nam alone and would mean that they would insist upon
                            some sort of settlement comparable to that in Laos. We do not believe
                            this is desirable or necessary, given the scale of Viet Cong action and
                            the stronger position of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the

                        <p>The Secretary requested Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName>’s estimate of the Indian influence on Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> said it was now very
                            little, mainly because of India’s difficulties with China. The primary
                            influence in Hanoi was held by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was some debate here as to the relative
                            ascendancy of Moscow’s and Peiping’s influence in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> remarked that Hanoi must
                            pay court these days to Peiping but they try to keep as clear of Peiping
                            influence as possible. In contrast, their relations with Moscow are
                            firm. Washington can talk straight to Moscow and the Soviets will
                            understand us. In turn, Hanoi will accept what Moscow says. If we try to
                            relay messages through India or Yugoslavia, Hanoi will be uncertain how
                            to interpret what Delhi or Belgrade says, and may well go to Moscow for
                            advice on that point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out the U.S. would have some difficulties over
                            going directly to the Soviets on questions involving South Viet Nam.
                            They would seize upon our approach as a negotiating point and try to
                            become involved in the South Viet Nam situation, just as they are now in
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> predicted that in such
                            circumstances the USSR would ask for a discussion of the Viet Nam
                            situation in a conference. He said, however, that he believed we would
                            be able to satisfy them by taking the stand that unification could not
                            possibly be negotiated under present circumstances, and then setting a
                            date, such as 1963, for further talks on unification. (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> did not make it clear whether he
                            meant that the USSR would be satisfied with this answer in bilateral
                            talks with us, or whether he envisaged that a <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0590"/>conference would be brought to agree on
                            such an arrangement. In earlier conversations, notably his conversation
                            with the Secretary on November 7,<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2">See <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> had reported that he had advised

                            trying to solve the Viet Nam situation by the conference method. He
                            feels that at a conference there will be a demand for unification by
                            elections as envisaged in the 1954 Geneva accord.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that in Viet Nam, as in other situations, the U.S.
                            is being asked to negotiate and make concessions in order to get the
                            other side to cease and desist from what amounts to highway robbery by
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> demurred from this view
                            of the Viet Nam situation, saying that the other side has some
                            justification in its claim that the 1954 agreements have never been
                            carried out. The Secretary dismissed this line of reasoning by pointing
                            out that since 1943 it is hard to find an agreement we have had with the
                            USSR that has not been violated by them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> responded by merely noting that violation of
                            agreements between opponents was not unusual in international affairs,
                            Pakistani agreements with India having often been violated.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> that,
                            looking beyond the present situation in Viet Nam, if it were not
                            possible to bring to a stop the present Communist activity there, and if
                            the solution in Laos were to prove unsatisfactory, there would be a
                            strong possibility that the United States would pull out of Southeast
                            Asia very fast and simply “take the area off our agenda.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> responded by suggesting
                            that we need not take a pessimistic view. In Laos, for example, we can
                            count on the fact that <persName corresp="#p_SP2">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> needs our aid, so that we can put much pressure on
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that it was Souphanouvong who is dragging his feet on
                            reaching agreement now. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName>
                            noted that for the past several years Souphanouvong has had to rely on
                            the Viet Minh for everything. It will take a while to rehabilitate him:
                            he cannot be expected to turn his back on his benefactors overnight. Mr.
                                <persName>Desai</persName> implied, however, that he believed
                            Souphanouvong could be rehabilitated, relying on the fundamental Laotian
                            dislike of the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to the consideration of the Joint Communiqué
                            to be issued by the President and the Prime Minister in the
                                afternoon.<note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">For text of the joint

                            force deployed for offensive operations. This will then degrade the

                        <p>Program is blunt. Loses “test” flavor of your recommendations which are
                            more apt to prod Diem to action. As written, State paper emphasizes too

                            <item>The timing of action is not covered. In particular, the relation
                                to Laos is left hanging. Does the draft mean wait at all costs till
                                Laos is buttoned up? If so, it may be indefinite and futile, and in
                                itself condemn us to the “seven points” only. On the other hand, it
                                is true that if we rely on sea lift the time of transit from the US
                                (35 days) or Hawaii (25-30 days since shipping has to come from the
                                US) would itself mean that, even if we decided now, we could hold
                                the impact of arrival of the major force off till a month from now.
                                If the movement leaked, we could argue a maneuver with at least
                                faint plausibility. By airlift or use of Okinawa forces we can of
                                course get some forces in quicker-a week by sea from Okinawa, 7-10
                                days to get a brigade from the US by air ….<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> However, on
                                this whole question of relation to Laos, the tough question is
                                whether the cat won’t be out of the bag the moment we say to Diem
                                that we will send forces. To me, the draft judgment that there is
                                “considerable risk” of the other side moving in Laos is a bit
                                over-stated. There is a risk, all right, but the right noises would
                                help keep it down-and it <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0594"/>doesn’t wholly go away even with a settlement. This again argues

                            <item>The paper does not mention the issue of honoring the Laos border.
                                This does hinge on a settlement. If there is one, or about to be
                                one, my own judgment is that we would be wiser, net, to honor the
                                border. However, we might have to change later if the flow kept

                            installing U.S. forces now, but commits us-in our minds-to a full scale
                            U.S. effort to save that country.</p>
                        <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0596"/>
                        <p>I appreciate, of course, the difficulty of the decision and the reasons
                            for reserving this move; but I should like to set out as clearly as I
                            can the reasons for placing some minimal U.S. ground force in Viet Nam
                            as part of the initial package.</p>
                        <p>This problem has been bedevilled by confusion about the various things a
                            U.S. force could initially accomplish: from fighting in the paddies and
                            jungles (which no one proposes), to guarding engineer units. To simplify
                            the matter, I shall make the case for placing immediately a U.S. (or
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>) force of (say) 5,000 men on
                            the 17th Parallel.<note n="3" xml:id="d233fn3">Neither the place nor the
                                figure are essential to the argument. As an initial point of
                                disposition, I like the Parallel because it fits the diplomatic
                                situation described in paragraph 3, below. I say 5,000 men because I
                                understood from the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> adviser to
                                the 1st <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> division that static
                                duty on the parallel was now being done by 3,500 men (half the
                                division); and U.S. forces could relieve them. On the other hand,
                                5,000 seemed a rough minimum U.S. unit that could protect itself.

                            <item>When we publish the Jorden Report and enlarge the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> we shall be declaring the 1954
                                Accords are being violated and we propose to deal with the

                                grossly exceeding the 1954 advisory ceiling. Under these
                                circumstances, the question arises: What is there to protect South
                                Viet Nam from the North Viet Nam divisions if the 1954 Accord is in
                                temporary abeyance? A U.S. (or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>) force on the Parallel would provide an
                                unambiguous answer.</item>

                            <item>If we go into a negotiation on Viet Nam with U.S. forces in place
                                on the 17th Parallel, we have a bargaining counter for a return to
                                the Geneva Accords namely, the withdrawal of our troops. Otherwise,
                                as Desai pointed out, a negotiation about Viet Nam might be turned
                                simply into a negotiation about South Viet Nam. In short, the
                                presence of the U.S. force would give us the element which we badly
                                lacked in the Laos negotiation, which led many of us, including
                                Harriman, to urge the installation of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan 5 in May.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Aside from these four specific points, there is a general attitude in the
                            State Department paper which I regard as dangerous. It would inhibit
                            U.S. action on our side of the truce lines of the Cold War for <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0597"/>fear of enemy escalation. The
                            lesson of the post-war, it seems to me, is that we must be prepared on
                            our side of the line to do whatever we believe necessary to protect our
                            own and the Free World’s interest. No one is proposing that we liberate
                            North Viet Nam. No one is proposing at this stage-although the issue may
                            have to be faced-selective action in North Viet Nam if Communist
                            infiltration does not stop. General TaylorM’s proposals are, in my view,
                            conservative proposals for action on our side of the Cold War truce
                            lines, to buy time and permit negotiation to take over for an interval,
                            under reasonably favorable circumstances. I think it unwise to inhibit
                            ourselves in these regions for fear of what the enemy may do by way of
                            reaction.</p>
                        <p>The steps proposed-including those which are now agreed-should, of
                            course, not be taken unless we are deeply prepared for all the possible
                            consequences. But, if the enemy goes to war-in Laos, South Viet Nam, or
                            both-because of our actions on our side of the line, it means he has
                            already decided to take Southeast Asia by whatever means are necessary;
                            and that his actions up to this point simply meant that he was prepared
                            to take South Viet Nam by cheap means and Laos by slow means, if
                            possible. If he goes to war because of what we do on our side of the
                            line, it does not mean that he went to war because of what we did. It
                            means he had already determined to face war rather than forego victory
                            in South Viet Nam, and that only our surrender of South Viet Nam could
                            prevent war.</p>
                        <p>Because of this assessment, I question the State Department’s judgment on
                            the relation between the introduction of U.S. troops and a Laos
                            settlement. The Communist problem is to decide whether or not they are
                            prepared to fight the U.S. (or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>)
                            in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>A final thought. With respect to both Cuba and Laos our legal and moral
                            case was ambiguous. It was impossible in our kind of society to rally
                            the full weight of American authority behind the military enterprises in
                            those areas. The case of South Viet Nam is clean. We know it; the enemy
                            knows it; and, in their hearts, the knowledgeable neutrals know it;
                            e.g., <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName>. The Jorden Report
                            will, I believe, be widely persuasive. If we move without
                            ambiguity-without the sickly pallor of our positions on Cuba and Laos-I
                            believe we can unite the country and the Free World; and there is a
                            better than even chance that the Communists will back down and bide
                            their time. This we should cheerfully accept; because the underlying
                            forces in Asia are with us, if we do not surrender and vigorously
                            exploit them.</p>

                            <item>By and large-with one major exception-I agree with the estimate.
                                The sentence which I would question is on page 6: “Nevertheless
                                these developments are not likely to substantially alter (sic)
                                Communist China’s attitudes towards military commitments in

                                which is probing to see if it can get <gloss target="#t_PL2">PL</gloss> 480 grain, and whose agriculture and industry are
                                disorganized in a crisis which will take several years at best to
                                surmount, would go to war except as a suicidal act. The present
                                Communist leaders have a long view of history and a great faith in
                                the future of China. There is no evidence that they are in a
                                suicidal mood. Mao’s basic precept has always been: “If the enemy
                                attacks, I disappear; if he defends, I harass; and if he retreats, I
                                attack.” Under present circumstances I believe that Communist China
                                would be in a mood to postpone its advance into Southeast Asia even
                                at the expense of what they would regard as a temporary
                                stabilization of the Free World’s position in South Viet-Nam so long
                                as we did not cross the 17th parallel with forces on the ground and
                                threaten to liberate North VietNam. Then-but only then-do I believe
                                they would go to war with us.</item>

                                suggests the possibility that if it looked as though South Viet-Nam
                                were winning out over the Communists in South VietNam, the
                                Communists would consider sending North Vietnamese regular units
                                into South VietNam, although they would recognize this action would
                                raise the risks of broadening the war. As I said to you in my

                                go to war in Southeast Asia depends on their assessment of U.S.
                                strength and determination. Thus far their whole operation has been
                                designed to bypass U.S. military strength, both nuclear and
                                conventional. I do not believe that they would go to war in
                                Southeast Asia merely to save a Communist foothold in South VietNam;

                            <p>This memorandum outlines a diplomatic-political course of action in
                                VietNam. It is put forward as offering the possibility of avoiding
                                heavy United States military commitments with attendant risk and at
                                the same time preventing the loss of South Viet-Nam to the
                                Communists. The chance of its success cannot be estimated but it
                                does not preclude other actions should it fail. Moreover, there are
                                some indications that the Soviet Union would be interested in the
                                establishment of a peaceful and stable situation in Southeast Asia,
                                at least for a time.</p>
                            <p>Every effort should be made to bring the present Laos negotiations to
                                a rapid conclusion-at Geneva and in Laos. Then certain commitments,
                                already agreed to, would become operative, namely not to use Lao
                                territory against any country with the undertaking by the U.S.S.R.
                                as a co-chairman to police Communist-bloc observance. Compliance or
                                noncompliance with this provision could be promptly ascertained.</p>
                            <p>The course here suggested involves a direct approach to the U.S.S.R.,
                                through our present relationship at the Geneva Conference on Laos.
                                Thus there is hope for a fairly quick reading on the prospect for
                                success.</p>

                                        situation in Southeast Asia. The progress made toward the
                                        settlement of the Laos question is meaningless if
                                        hostilities continue in neighboring VietNam. The United
                                        States believes that an effort should be made to resolve
                                        that situation peacefully and end the aggression against

                                        the 1954 Accords by <gloss target="#t_NVN1">NVN</gloss> has
                                        caused the United States to support <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. A peaceful settlement should be built on
                                        the foundation of the 1954 Accords. The U.S.S.R. and the
                                        United Kingdom, as co-chairmen, should bring together a
                                        small group of the powers directly concerned to review the
                                        Accords to see how compliance can be secured and how they
                                        can be strengthened to meet today’s needs. If this small
                                        group of powers could agree on measures to this end, the
                                        co-chairmen could present the results of their work to the
                                        Geneva Conference as a whole for ratification. The powers
                                        which would be engaged in this review would be the U.K.,
                                        U.S.S.R., United States, Communist China, France, North
                                        VietNam, South VietNam, and India (perhaps). Although France
                                        is not as directly concerned as the others we cannot afford
                                        the resentment which would be caused by excluding her. As
                                        chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and the
                                        largest free country in the general region, India could make
                                        an important contribution if it so desired. This group of
                                        seven or eight powers, comprising those most directly
                                        interested, would be broadly representative enough to ensure
                                        that its conclusions would be adopted by the Conference as a
                                        whole and it would be small enough to be workable.</p>

                                        military situation there. As hostilities are brought under
                                        control and as the situation demonstrates stability, the

                                    afford to stake its prestige there. We must make it clear to

                                (received in the Department on November 12 at 6:08 a.m.), and sent
                                eyes only for the Secretary, Nolting asked for permission to return
                                to Washington for a brief period of consultation regarding Vietnam.
                                He gave the following as the main reasons for his request:</note>
                            While I recognize cogency of arguments you have advanced for immediate
                            brief period consultation Washington, believe that we cannot afford
                            inevitable delay in implementation action program based on <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report (forthcoming <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss>) which would result from your
                            absence from your post at this time. I feel that you should personally
                            and immediately conduct complex and delicate negotiations with Diem
                            which are condition precedent for launching of this ambitious program on
                            which so much hinges. We estimate that trip you suggest would result in
                            delay of two weeks in getting this effort under way. Such a delay
                            unacceptable when time crucial factor.</p>
                        <p>“1. I believe I can help mold plan which will fit here; in any event I
                            should see and discuss details of what’s being developed before it is
                            finalized;</p>
                        <p>“2. It would be most valuable-from standpoint of correct understanding of
                            Washington intentions and of Embassy and Task Force authority in
                            executing U.S. plans-if I could personally bring back President’s
                            decision. (Standing of those on spot here was inevitably diminished-to

                        <p>The Ambassador came in to discuss Viet-Nam in light of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s mission.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would not try to give a run-down of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s report but would
                            outline what we intend to do. We plan to take the necessary measures
                            which will make it possible for Viet-Nam to win its own war. We will put
                            in additional economic and ordinary military assistance and supply some
                            types of support the Vietnamese cannot supply themselves. The latter
                            will include American-manned photo reconnaissance and airlift
                            capability. We will supply personnel and certain equipment to assist
                            reorganizing parts of the government and its intelligence functions.
                            More military instructors will be made available at lower levels within
                            the Vietnamese forces so as to overcome immobility. Food will be
                            supplied in connection with flood relief. We will provide assistance so
                            as to enable the Vietnamese to block Viet-Minh movement by sea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued by saying Diem must reorganize to give authority
                            to civilian and military parts of his government so that these can
                            operate effectively without his direct supervision. National
                            mobilization of Viet-Nam is the goal. We do not, however, visualize
                            sending U.S. forces of the battle-group type, although this may become
                            necessary later.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the French Government fears that the U.S. will
                            send fighting forces, perhaps starting with engineers.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the idea of sending engineers had been dropped
                            as the flood is now receding. We will, instead, backstop Vietnamese
                            flood relief efforts with supplies.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expanded on French opposition to U.S. troops. First, no
                            pretext should be given the Soviets to make trouble at <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0607"/>Geneva. Second, the Soviets should not
                            be given a pretext to intervene in mass in VietNam.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we share the concern. So far as the second point is
                            concerned, intervention is already on a large scale and is increasing.
                            It is now company-sized forces with Western weapons. Three Viet-Minh
                            regiments may be involved.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador continued by stating the West is in a bad position to
                            fight in Viet-Nam as the French know by experience. It would be
                            disastrous to lose Viet-Nam but France does not want to see the
                            involvement of forces escalated by the introduction of American
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we cannot see the story of Laos repeated in
                            VietNam. Friendly and United States public opinion would not accept
                            this; isolationism would increase. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies have questioned our resolve on Laos. Laos is a bad precedent. We
                            press <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> to negotiate while
                            the other side concedes nothing. If the result of Geneva does not lead
                            to a genuine coalition and true neutrality but rather to a disguised
                            surrender, then it is difficult to see how the United States can sign
                            the Geneva accords or convince the American people that a neutral Laos
                            has been established. In VietNam, meantime, the Soviets blandly aid the
                            Viet-Minh and say that all that is taking place is a popular revolt
                            against Diem. They see no need to compromise if they can pick-up
                            Southeast Asia without it. We are seeking to build up Vietnamese morale
                            through our assistance, realizing that it is up to the Vietnamese
                            government to do the main job.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked if the United States position is that it will not
                            now send forces but will not discard the possibility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied affirmatively. We realize that sending troops would
                            represent a risk. It might be a greater risk not to send them. If
                            Southeast Asia is lost, our alliances throughout the world will be
                            affected. The United States must look across the Pacific as well as the
                            Atlantic. This attitude is different than that of Western European
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he wished to sum up his government’s views which he
                            believed were shared by the British: it favors U.S. support of
                            Vietnamese forces but believes the introduction of American forces would
                            have a bad result.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the loss of Southeast Asia would be more
                            important to the U.S. than to Europe. We hope that we can work together,
                            but if the issue comes to be one of the possible loss of Southeast Asia
                            and our European friends do not agree with our policies to prevent this,
                            then our paths may have to diverge.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> asked if the Sec. had gotten the message
                            from the NSC on Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">Not further
                                identified, but it apparently pertained to the scheduling of another
                                meeting on Vietnam.</note> Johnson said he had tried to discourage
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and according to
                            Taylor the Pres. was receptive. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said he had told <hi rend="italic">Taylor</hi>
                            he thought we had our decisions and that there was no necessity for
                            another meeting. Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> said that Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> was on his way to
                            talk to the Vice President now. The only ones left out were the Vice
                            President and Dillon. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            said he had had word that <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> was agreeable if the Secretary was. He said we
                            could check the paper out with Dillon and <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> without having a meeting. The Sec. asked if they
                            had indicated they wanted to wait until after NSC mtg., adding he would
                            talk to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> by phone.<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">At 2:15 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> called Johnson, who said “we would have to move
                                quickly-Galbraith had been working hard on this.” Johnson said he
                                was “a little worried” since he had given <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> a copy of the draft

                        <p>The British Ambassador came at our request to talk with the Secretary
                            about Laos and VietNam.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Laos.]</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">VietNam</hi>. The Secretary said that we are moving
                            into the next chapter in our efforts to put Diem in position to win his
                            war against the communists. We are planning to give him increased
                            airlift capacity, mostly helicopters, a “Jungle Jim” unit, assistance
                            with photo reconnaissance, some intelligence personnel and advice,
                            additional military advisers so that we may be able to put U.S. advisers
                            down to lower combat echelons, that we will back Diem on his own flood
                            rehabilitation programs with heavy equipment trucks, technical advice,
                            etc. The Secretary pointed out the these moves did not involve sending
                            organized U.S. combat units although it might become necessary to give
                            serious consideration to putting in combat troops depending on the
                            situation some weeks hence.</p>
                        <p>The moves that we are now planning will bring in U.S. personnel beyond
                            the limits set by the Geneva Accords. We will be prepared to abide by
                            the Accords as soon as the communists do so. The Ambassador asked
                            whether we were intending to make an announcement giving the nature and
                            scope of our assistance. The Secretary replied that we are intending to
                            release the Jorden Report before our moves would come to public
                            attention … and we would probably wait until such increases in personnel
                            were being protested openly before making any direct announcement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we were also urging Diem to undertake
                            administrative and political reforms designed to improve the efficiency
                            and general acceptability of his government. Diem was still involving
                            himself with too many details and consequently unable to give adequate
                            leadership and direction in major matters.</p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0610"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador suggested that the Jorden Report would be a big help to
                            the British in their role as co-chairman, and the Secretary said that we
                            would send pre-publication copies to the British as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>The Sec returned the call and T asked if Johnson had mentioned the
                            proposal to have an NSC meeting Wednesday.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">November 15.</note> The Sec answered in the affirmative and asked
                            is it for making decisions or to ratify a refurbished paper. T said it
                            was two-fold-some advisers were not at the Sat mtg<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">See <ref target="#d236">Document 236</ref>.</note>
                            particularly Treas and there was question as to whether it should not
                            warrant this mtg and the Sec would have the papers ready to go. The Sec
                            asked how T and J are coming on the papers and T said he and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> would see J here at 4:30. The
                            Sec asked how far-reaching and T said not much on the cable but literary
                            comments on the letter.<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">Reference is to
                                instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> and a letter from President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> to President Diem; see <ref target="#d257fn2">Document 257 and footnote 2</ref>
                                thereto.</note> The Sec said he was reluctant to see us delay very
                            much but probably they can’t go out until tomorrow. T does not want
                            delay either. The Sec suggested sending them over to Dillon to have him
                            look at them. T said <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McG. Bundy</persName>
                            was preparing a memo for the record<note n="5" xml:id="d244fn5">See <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> and running into

                            feeling is the Pres does not know what he is approving. Some things are
                            unthought out recommendations and we should tell him this means so and

                            envisage that reports to the President will be necessary on a

                            the senior officer to assume the command.</p>

                            a bad thing wherever it occurs, but because this particular threat
                            happens to be close to my country.</p>
                        <p>To begin with, let me say that I fully understand the reasons for the
                            concern of the United States with regard to the situation in South
                            Vietnam. Like you, we in Burma desire to see a unified, independent and
                            democratic Vietnam, and until that can be achieved, we wish to see South
                            Viet-Nam develop as a truly democratic and nationalist entity. Only then
                            can there be any hope of the eventual emergence of a unified,
                            independent and democratic Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Recent press reports connected with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s visit to South Viet-Nam have referred to the
                            possible despatch of United States forces to South Vietnam. This is
                            probably no more than speculation, but even so, it opens up such
                            dangerous possibilities that I feel it my duty, both as a lover of peace
                            and as a friend of the United States, to say that I would regard such a
                            step as a very grave mistake. In my view, South Vietnamese problems
                            cannot be solved by military means. It can only be solved through
                            measures which will help to bring the Vietnamese masses solidly behind
                            the Diem Government. Besides, introduction of foreign troops into South
                            Viet-Nam would only worsen the situation, because it would certainly
                            produce similar measures in North Vietnam, leading to a military
                            confrontation between East and West whose consequences no one can
                            foretell. These steps certainly would not conduce to the eventual
                            emergence of a united, independent and democratic Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, in sharing these thoughts with you, I would like you to
                            know that I have made known to the Government of North Viet-Nam my grave
                            concern at the persistent reports of North Vietnamese subversive
                            activities in South Vietnam, and have warned them that such activities,
                            if not ended, can only endanger the peace <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0618"/>by inviting new steps by the South Vietnamese
                            Government and its close friends.</p>
                        <p>I trust that you will not regard this letter as an unwarranted intrusion
                            on my part. As I have said earlier, my sole purpose is to help maintain
                            the peace of the world and promote the future well-being of South-East
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>With my warm regards and good wishes,</p>

                                    intelligence on <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength or on
                                    the numerical importance of infiltration. It is abundantly
                                    clear, however, that infiltration is taking place, that it has
                                    been accelerated in recent months, and that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> war could not be long continued

                                    available to us has been summarized in the <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName> report. Some of this

                                    evidence includes the statements of interrogated prisoners as
                                    well as captured documents and diaries. It reveals that whole
                                    units as well as individuals have been infiltrated, and that the
                                    infiltration routes include southern Laos, the 17th parallel,
                                    and the sea.</p>
                                <p>Hard core <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength is now
                                    estimated at about 20,000. These are armed and trained forces,
                                    about half of which are believed to operate in regular units.
                                    This summer, when hard core <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                                    were believed to number 12,000, between five and thirty per cent
                                    were <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0619"/>thought to have
                                    been infiltrated from the north. In early October, <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Saigon reported that 25 to 40
                                    per cent of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength is
                                    probably composed of infiltrees. Thus, while it is clear that
                                    most <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> have not been infiltrated
                                    from the north, it is also apparent that both the rate of
                                    infiltration and the percentage of infiltrees in the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces have increased.</p>
                                <p>Regardless of the relative number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infiltrated from the north, it has always been
                                    true that this element provides the leadership and the backbone
                                    of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces. This means of
                                    course that infiltration has always been essential to the
                                    prosecution of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> war. It
                                    also means that continued acceleration of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> drive will require increased
                                    infiltration as well as increased local recruitment.</p>
                                <p>Infiltration is relatively more significant in terms of total
                                        <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> strength in the Plateau
                                    area than in the delta. While overall <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> forces may now include as little as 25 per cent
                                    infiltrees, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> operating on
                                    the plateau adjoining the Lao border are believed to be largely
                                    composed of men infiltrated from the north. The most
                                    conservative estimate now places the number of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> in that area at 4,000.</p>
                                <p>Recent intelligence indicates that infiltration directly across
                                    the 17th parallel is considerable. While it is probably easier
                                    to enter South Viet-Nam via Laos, there is no guarantee that
                                    friendly control of the Lao panhandle would seriously handicap
                                    the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> unless it was coupled with
                                    effective denial of the routes leading directly across the
                                    parallel.</p>

                            <item><p><gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> Potential. The <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is known to have more than
                                    300,000 men in its armed forces. Probably the majority are
                                    veterans of the long guerrilla war against the French. Many are
                                    southerners who came north during the regroupment period
                                    following the Geneva Agreements in 1954. These forces obviously
                                    provide a very large reservoir of trained guerrilla forces which
                                    could be dispatched to South Viet-Nam very quickly. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could probably double or even
                                    triple their present strength, by infiltration alone, in a very
                                    short time. Since it requires about 15 <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> regulars to deal with one guerrilla, it seems
                                    clear that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> can more than
                                    meet any increase in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                                    forces.</p>
                                <p>To the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infiltration potential
                                    must be added potential local support. Maximum voluntary
                                    supporters are now estimated by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at 200,000; our people are inclined to cut this
                                    figure in half. However, much if not most local <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> recruitment is accomplished by at
                                    least a measure of force or threat. To estimates of voluntary
                                    supporters a considerable number of involuntary supporters
                                    should probably be added.</p>

                            draft action memo is based, but there are certain aspects of the memo
                            which give me some trouble.</p>

                            strategic moment for the introduction of U.S. troop units. The world has
                            been made aware of the crisis in Viet Nam as a result of the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mission. Both the Bloc and the
                            Free World are going to look upon the actions we take now as the key to
                            our future actions no matter what we may say. A plate glass window on
                            the 17th parallel or a flood relief task force could make a great
                            political difference not only in Viet Nam, but in the whole area. Such
                            intervention later might have much less political effect and may have to
                            be on a much larger scale to have military effect. In any event, in the
                            interim uncertainty as to our intentions will grow.</p>
                        <p>I am concerned about the relationship between our actions and the
                            diplomatic noises we propose to make. Have we really decided to “prevent
                            the fall of South Viet Nam by whatever means are necessary”? (par. 6
                            (a)) If not, should we say so to the USSR? I understand that endorsement
                            of a general statement to this effect was explicitly avoided at the
                            meeting on Saturday.<note n="3" xml:id="d250fn3">Apparently a reference

                            question of whether we are prepared to introduce combat troops if
                            necessary even if we are not going to introduce them now. That is
                            obviously the ultimate test of whether we are prepared to prevent the
                            fall of Viet Nam. Until we have decided it in our own minds, I do not
                            think that we ought to make statements to the USSR that may reflect only
                            hypothetical intentions. Past employment of such statements has
                            depreciated their effect.</p>

                        <p>Finally, if we are really prepared to use troops eventually, shouldn’t
                            there be some hint of this in our conversations with Diem (par. 3)? You
                            would have a much better feel for this than I do, but I don’t think that
                            some such indication would cause Diem to sit back and turn over
                            responsibility for the ultimate fate of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to the U.S. The situation is not analogous to that in
                            Laos where we have had to be very careful about the way we committed
                            ourselves to Phoumi for fear that he would not take negotiations
                            seriously.</p>
                        <p>What is needed, if we are not going to provide troops, is some equivalent
                            of the bilateral agreement requested by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Perhaps it could take the form of pointing to our
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> commitment and stating that
                            we consider this commitment binding without regard to how other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members may vote on intervention.
                            (This was the formula developed for talks with <persName corresp="#p_KT1">Thanat</persName> but never, to my knowledge, used
                            in those talks.)</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Command Concept</hi>. The proposal that a senior
                            military commander be put in charge of all U.S. counterinsurgency
                            efforts in Viet Nam is going to create all kinds of problems and I fail
                            to see that it has compensating advantages. Counterinsurgency efforts
                            clearly embrace all activities of any importance. The change would
                            reflect the changed character of our military relationship under the
                            proposed recommendations-our greater operational involvementbut it will
                            downgrade a capable ambassador who has a very good relationship with
                            Diem to the role of a political adviser. It will create new, difficult
                            problems of relationship between the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>, embassy, <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and
                            the military. It will also tend to give the effort a wholly military
                            cast which will be undesirable both intrinsically and because of its
                            effect on the attitude of the rest of the world toward the Diem
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>Why not reorganize the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, give it a
                            new name to reflect its new duties (including operational control of
                            U.S. units) and put a senior general in charge, but leave ultimate
                            responsibility with the ambassador? Or, if some change is absolutely
                            necessary, it might possibly be better to make the ambassador and the
                            military commander co-equal heads of our activities.</p>
                        <p>If we need to create a theater commander as a dramatic move, would it be
                            better to give him all of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> as his
                            theater and leave the ambassador in charge in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>? (Incidentally, if this change does go through as
                            proposed, I assume that a Defense representative will become director of
                            the Washington Task Force.)</p>

                            <item>Par. 1: These three cases seem somewhat vaguely stated, perhaps
                                deliberately so for security reasons. Are we clear as to what is
                                intended by each?</item>
                            <item>Par. 2 (a) and (c): Who is going to decide how many helicopters,
                                hello-couriers, small craft, etc., are to be provided? There will be
                                a real argument about such specifics unless there is already a clear
                                understanding as to the requirements.</item>
                            <item>Par. 2 (d): Do we know clearly how we are going to expedite Civil
                                Guard and Self Defense Corps training? The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report was not specific on
                                this. We have long been aware of the problem; “expediting” isn’t
                                going to solve it unless we have a plan.</item>
                            <item>Pars. 2 (e), (f) and (i): One of the very difficult problems
                                involved in implementing the encadrement concept is going to be to
                                find the necessary intelligence, military and administrative
                                personnel. We will need a special study and crash effort on this
                                problem. Should we rob U.S. activities around the world of
                                French-speaking personnel? Is special incentive pay required to get
                                people into this war area? Would active and reserve military
                                personnel trained in military government be a good source of
                                candidates for administrative cadres?</item>
                            <item>Par. 2 (g): What is the relationship between existing economic aid
                                and these proposals? For example, are flood requirements going to be
                                covered within the existing commercial import program? Gardiner a
                                week or so ago suggested such an approach to the Vietnamese<note n="4" xml:id="d250fn4">Not further identified.</note> pointing
                                out that we are committed to make up any trade deficits under the
                                agreed import criteria and that, therefore, if the flood increased
                                total needs we would increase our total aid as that became
                                necessary. The Vietnamese can be depended upon, however, to ask that
                                such aid be clearly additional to the level we have set for the
                                commercial import program. What is the significance of the material
                                in parentheses? Does the President’s approval of the action memo
                                constitute approval of our financing of an increase in military pay,
                                etc.?</item>
                            <item>Par. 2 (h): Are we clear that the FAO can undertake such a relief
                                job? I understand that the organization has never run one. I would
                                think we would want an organization that had considerable past
                                experience-perhaps the International Red Cross though its scope may
                                be too narrow for the job here. If an international approach should
                                not prove feasible, how is the relief job to be organized?</item>
                            <item>Par. 3: The proposed undertakings by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> seem exceedingly general. Wouldn’t they need to be
                                spelled out in any communication? <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0623"/>For just one example, the need to reduce static
                                deployments of the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ought to be
                                covered. (Perhaps the mention of the detailed recommendations of the
                                Taylor Mission and the Country Team is, however, intended to
                                incorporate their proposals by reference.) I am puzzled by the
                                reference in 3 (b) to wartime government agencies. I was not aware
                                that we wanted the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to establish
                                any number of new wartime agencies. It is difficult to say in the
                                abstract whether this would be a good idea. It could provide the
                                basis for some decentralization of power and for bringing new people
                                into the government or new people to the top within the government.
                                However, if it is like the last reorganization, it will be mostly
                                facade. Reorganization could also lead to some loss of governmental
                                effectiveness.</item>

                            <item>It is universally agreed that the objective of the proposed
                                exercise in Viet-Nam is to induce the Communists to cease
                                infiltration, return to the Geneva Accord, while assisting South
                                Viet-Nam in reducing the force of some 16,000 guerrillas now
                                operating in the country. This track unquestionably will require
                                extensive talk with the Bloc countries and, at some stage, probably

                                        If we postpone action to talk, the Communists will do two
                                        things: they will extend that talk while continuing to
                                        dismantle South Viet-Nam and (as the British and Desai have
                                        indicated) will focus the negotiation on elections. Only a

                                        a credible threat to impose military action against North

                                        as definitively confirmed. There will be real panic and

                            <item>In Viet-Nam the gut issue is not whether Diem is or is not a good
                                ruler. That is important in a variety of ways; but he was doing fine
                                from 1956 to 1959, by the standards we apply to other underdeveloped
                                countries. The gut issue is whether we shall continue to accept the
                                systematic infiltration of men from outside and the operation from
                                outside of a guerrilla war against him which has built up from 2,000
                                to 16,000 effectives in two years. The whole world is asking a
                                simple question: what will the U.S. do about it? If our policy and
                                action is focused sharply on this question, I believe there is a
                                fair chance of avoiding a war. If we act indecisively now, I <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0625"/>fear we shall produce
                                excessive fears on our side and excessive hopes on the other side;
                                and then we shall have to over-react to correct a disintegrating
                                situation worse than the present. In those circumstances there
                                would, indeed, be a danger of war. As in Korea we would have first
                                tempted the enemy by our apparent weakness and then double-crossed
                                him. It is that circumstance I would wish to see us avoid.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Therefore, I suggest that we make the moves we believe required to
                            stabilize the situation and to buy time in South VietNam; and then by
                            imaginative communication and diplomacy-addressed to all elements in the
                            Bloc as well as the Free World-we bring maximum pressure on Hanoi to
                            call off the invasion of South Viet-Nam now under way. Such

                                    for guerrilla warfare? Should we have not done it at the company

                        <p>So many people have offered their opinions on South Viet-Nam that more
                            may not be helpful. But the other day at the swimming pool you asked me
                            what I thought and here it is.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">A. We should now agree to send about one division when
                                needed for military action inside South Vietnam.</hi></p>
                        <p>1. I believe we should commit limited U.S. combat units, if necessary for
                            military purposes (not for morale), to help save South Vietnam. A
                            victory here would produce great effects all over the world. A defeat
                            would hurt, but not much more than a loss of South Viet-Nam with the
                            levels of U.S. help now committed or planned.</p>
                        <p>2. I believe our willingness to make this commitment, if necessary,
                            should be clearly understood, by us and by Diem, before we begin the
                            actions now planned. I think without that decision the whole program
                            will be half-hearted. With this decision I believe the odds are almost
                            even that the commitment will not have to be carried out. This
                            conclusion is, I believe, the inner conviction of your Vice President,
                            your Secretaries of State and Defense, and the two heads of your special
                            mission, and that is why I am troubled by your most natural desire to
                            act on other items now, without taking the troop decision. Whatever the
                            reason, this has now become a sort of touchstone of our will.</p>
                        <p>3. I believe the actions now planned, plus the basic decision to put in
                            limited combat troops if necessary, are all that is currently wanted. I
                            would not put in a division for morale purposes. I’d put it in later, to
                            fight if need be. After all, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> himself recommended, on balance, against combat
                            troops less than a month ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Reference is

                        <p>4. The use of force up to a total of 20-25,000, inside Vietnam, is not on
                            the same footing as the larger forces that might become necessary if the
                            Vietminh move to direct invasion. I would not make the larger decision
                            on a war against North Viet-Nam today.</p>

                        <p>5. I believe South Viet-Nam stands, internally and externally, on a
                            footing wholly different from Laos. Laos was never really ours after
                            1954. South Viet-Nam is and wants to be. Laotians have fought very
                            little. South Viet-Nam troops are not U.S. Marines, but they are usable.
                            This makes the opinion problem different at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>6. I believe the <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName> Report,
                            the exchange of letters, and Stevenson and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, can coolly justify this basic line of action, not
                            to all the world, but to an effective fraction. I do not expect that
                            these actions will lead to rapid escalation of the conflict, since they
                            remain essentially on our side of the line, and since the Communists do
                            not want that kind of test.</p>
                        <p>7. I think this solution will put a serious strain on our position in
                            Laos, but that has always been a bad bargain. My advice would be to give
                            the game promptly to Souvanna and hope for the best, meanwhile holding
                            hard to our new course in South Vietnam. Souvanna may make noises
                            against that action, but I don’t think he’ll fight or be overthrown by
                            the <gloss target="#t_PL2">PL</gloss> for a while.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">C. The role of your senior advisers to Diem is
                                crucial.</hi></p>
                        <p>8. Next only to the basic decision, I put the role of the men to act for
                            you in South Vietnam. I now accept, after some doubts, the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> view that the man in charge of the war must be
                            a military man. His quality thus becomes decisive, and <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> should be judged as his
                            complement, not as your head man in South Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> has been inadequate. All the
                            pressures will be in favor of a solid, virtuous, not quite first-rate
                            senior officer. You need a man chosen with inspiration by you and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> personally; his
                            rank can be arranged.</p>
                        <p>9. In addition to his personal qualities, this senior man will need the
                            full confidence and support of Diem. No one action can guarantee this
                            relation, but our present efforts with Diem should be directed toward
                            strengthening the role of the U.S. military commander in every possible
                            way. How this should be done is a matter of tactics-but it should not be
                            left to faith, hope and charity.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows a brief discussion of other matters.] A brief outline of
                            the size and disposition of Chinese armed forces was given. The
                            President then asked what routes of movement are available for these
                            troops from China to North Viet Nam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AR1">Amory</persName> pointed out and described the condition of railway
                            and roads of access and cited the generally inadequate aspects of these
                            avenues. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> cautioned
                            that it should not be assumed that the Chinese setbacks as well as the
                            ideological rift were such that the Soviets and Chinese would not be
                            able nor willing to engage jointly any nation which threatened Communist
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> explained the Draft of
                            Memorandum on South Viet Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2"><ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> He added the hope
                            that, in spite of the magnitude of the proposal, any U.S. actions would
                            not be hampered by lack of funds nor failure to pursue the program
                            vigorously. The President expressed the fear of becoming involved
                            simultaneously on two fronts on opposite sides of the world. He
                            questioned the wisdom of involvement in Viet Nam since the basis thereof
                            is not completely clear. By comparison he noted that Korea was a case of
                            clear aggression which was opposed by the United States and other
                            members of the U.N. The conflict in Viet Nam is more obscure and <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0630"/>less flagrant. The President
                            then expressed his strong feeling that in such a situation the United
                            States needs even more the support of allies in such an endeavor as Viet
                            Nam in order to avoid sharp domestic partisan criticism as well as
                            strong objections from other nations of the world. The President said
                            that he could even make a rather strong case against intervening in an
                            area 10,000 miles away against 16,000 guerrillas with a native army of
                            200,000, where millions have been spent for years with no success. The
                            President repeated his apprehension concerning support, adding that none
                            could be expected from the French, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> interrupted to say that the British were tending
                            more and more to take the French point of view. The President compared
                            the obscurity of the issues in Viet Nam to the clarity of the positions
                            in Berlin, the contrast of which could even make leading Democrats wary
                            of proposed activities in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that firmness in
                            Viet Nam in the manner and form of that in Berlin might achieve desired
                            results in Viet Nam without resort to combat. The President disagreed
                            with the suggestion on the basis that the issue was clearly defined in
                            Berlin and opposing forces identified whereas in Viet Nam the issue is
                            vague and action is by guerrillas, sometimes in a phantom-like fashion.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed an
                            opinion that action would become clear if U.S. forces were involved
                            since this power would be applied against sources of Viet Cong power
                            including those in North Viet Nam. The President observed that it was
                            not clear to him just where these U.S. forces would base their
                            operations other than from aircraft carriers which seemed to him to be
                            quite vulnerable. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> confirmed that carriers would be involved to a
                            considerable degree and stated that Taiwan and the Philippines would
                            also become principal bases of action.</p>
                        <p>With regard to sources of power in North Viet Nam, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> cited Hanoi as the most important
                            center in North Viet Nam and it would be hit. However, he considered it
                            more a political target than a military one and under these
                            circumstances such an attack would “raise serious questions.” He
                            expressed the hope that any plan of action in North Viet Nam would
                            strike first of all any Viet Cong airlift into South Viet Nam in order
                            to avoid the establishment of a procedure of supply similar to that
                            which the Soviets have conducted for so long with impunity in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> raised the question as to whether or not
                            U.S. action in Viet Nam would not render the Laotian settlement more
                            difficult. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that it
                            would to a certain degree but qualified his statement with the caveat
                            that the difficulties could be controlled somewhat by the manner in
                            which actions in Viet Nam are initiated.</p>
                        <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>The President returned the discussion to the point of what will be done
                            next in Viet Nam rather than whether or not the U.S. would become
                            involved. He cautioned that the technique of U.S. actions should not
                            have the effect of unilaterally violating Geneva accords. He felt that a
                            technique and timing must be devised which will place the onus of
                            breaking the accords on the other side and require them to defend their
                            actions. Even so, he realized that it would take some time to achieve
                            this condition and even more to build up world opinion against Viet
                            Cong. He felt that the <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName>
                            Report might be utilized in this effort.</p>
                        <p>The President discussed tactics in dealing with the International Control
                            Commission. He delineated a clever plan to charge North Viet Nam with
                            the onus for breaking accords. Following this he envisioned the
                            initiation of certain U.S. actions. He realized that these actions would
                            be criticized and subject to justification in world opinion but felt
                            that it would be much less difficult if this particular U.S. action were
                            secondary rather than primary. He directed State to study possible
                            courses of action with consideration for his views relating to timing
                            and to the Geneva Accords. He asked State also to consider the position
                            of the individual members of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and
                            further suggested that the time was appropriate to induce India to agree
                            to follow U.S. suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> reported that parts of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_JWJ1">Jorden</persName> Report are already in
                            the hands of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. He questioned the
                            value of utilizing the report in the suggested manner since to do so
                            would simply be to place a U.S. stamp on the report. Such action might
                            not reap the desired effects.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what nations would possibly support the U.S.
                            intervention in Viet Nam, listing Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines,
                            Australia, New Zealand (?). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that they all would but the President
                            implied doubts because of the pitfalls of the particular type of war in
                            Viet Nam. He described it as being more a political issue, of different
                            magnitude and (again) less defined than the Korean War.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said that the studies
                            suggested to him that the job to be done has been magnified, thereby
                            leading to pessimistic conclusions as to outcome. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> responded that although the
                            discussion and even some of the draft memoranda were somewhat
                            pessimistic, he returned from Viet Nam with optimism over what could be
                            done if certain clearcut actions were taken. He envisioned two phases:
                            (1) the revival of Viet Nam morale and (2) the initiation of the
                            guerrilla suppression program. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> cautioned that the program was in fact complex
                            and that in all probability U.S. troops, planes and resources would have
                            to be supplied in additional quantities at a later date.</p>

                        <p>The President asked the Secretary of Defense if he would take action if
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> did not exist and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied in the affirmative.
                            The President asked for justification and <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> replied that the world would be divided in the
                            area of Southeast Asia on the sea, in the air and in communications. He
                            said that Communist conquest would deal a severe blow to freedom and
                            extend Communism to a great portion of the world. The President asked
                            how he could justify the proposed courses of action in Viet Nam while at
                            the same time ignoring Cuba. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> hastened to add that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> feel that even at this point the United
                            States should go into Cuba.</p>
                        <p>The President stated the time had come for neutral nations as well as
                            others to be in support of U.S. policy publicly. He felt that we should
                            aggressively determine which nations are in support of U.S. policy and
                            that these nations should identify themselves. The President again
                            expressed apprehension on support of the proposed action by the Congress
                            as well as by the American people. He felt that the next two or three
                            weeks should be utilized in making the determination as to whether or
                            not the proposed program for Viet Nam could be supported. His impression
                            was that even the Democratic side of Congress was not fully convinced.
                            The President stated that he would like to have the Vice President’s
                            views in this regard and at that point asked if there was information on
                            the Vice President’s arrival.<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">In a

                                in which the November 15 meeting had been scheduled and how he had
                                been unable to notify the Vice President prior to his departure from

                                plans. <persName corresp="#p_BCHL1">Burris</persName> then described
                                the course of the meeting:</note> The President then stated that no

                            that he would discuss these subjects with the Vice President. He asked
                            State to report to him when the directed studies had been completed.</p>
                        <p>“The meeting proceeded in the normal fashion with the first hour being
                            consumed by the presentation of reports. Discussion continued until
                            about 11:30, at which time the President asked me if I had further
                            information on your arrival and, when I replied in the negative, he
                            asked if I would check. I went outside the meeting and called <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walter [Jenkins]</persName> and discovered that
                            you had informed him around midnight of your difficulty in returning to
                            Washington last night by private plane because of weather and of the
                            possibility that you might not return to Washington as scheduled but
                            might proceed to Seattle. I returned to the meeting and informed the
                            President that I could not ascertain the details of your flight and
                            arrival at the moment. The President then suggested that the meeting be
                            adjourned and that he would discuss the subject with you later.”

                            good and has Diem’s confidence. He wants to keep him there. I expressed
                            my uncertainty. He persists. On military leadership he agrees strongly
                            that no routine four-star general will do. I would still consider
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGGC1">McGhee</persName> (for one thing, if he
                            thinks it won’t work after a good look, he’ll tell you, and he has the
                            authority of the victor of Greece).</p>
                        <p>3. The problem of allied support</p>
                        <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>You want to get as much backing as possible from Allies. I think this
                            means a strong line with British, an appeal for Australian help, and
                            pressure via <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> on
                            Indians. (<persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName> assured me he
                            would put all the heat you wanted on Indians and thought he could do
                            anything in reason, short of bringing Indian troops into Saigon for
                            combat.) I think Secretary will respond well on this, subject to point 5
                            below.</p>
                        <p>4. The problem of enemy reactions</p>
                        <p>I asked Secretary if he thought action now recommended would be enough if
                            enemy stepped up infiltration. He thought more might be needed, but
                            within <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. He is against bombing Hanoi
                            as a response to guerrilla infiltration. He believes we should do enough
                            to put the result up to Diem.</p>
                        <p>5. The problem of U.S. clarity of purpose</p>
                        <p>Secretary thinks the good of our actions depends on belief we mean to
                            hold in Southeast Asia. He knows we may lose, and he knows we want no
                            Korea, but he thinks we must try to hold and must show determination to
                            all concerned. He suggests you should let this be a <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Plan and fire all concerned if it doesn’t work.
                            He thinks we must meet <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            in Viet-Nam or take a terrible defeat. I attach cables showing what Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_AH1">Alphand</persName> amp; Ormsby Gore.<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3">Neither found attached, but reference is to the

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Since its birth, more than six years ago, the Republic of
                                    Viet-Nam has enjoyed the close friendship and cooperation of the
                                    United States of America. On our mutual concern for the future
                                    of the Vietnamese people, on our mutual determination to defend
                                    the frontiers of the Free World against Communist aggression,
                                    and on our mutual dedication to the ideal of human dignity, we
                                    have founded an international partnership which I believe is of
                                    great and lasting value not only to our two peoples but to all
                                    free men. Together, we have built a bridge of understanding and
                                    friendship between an Asian people and a Western people, setting
                                    an example for all who believe that great historical and
                                    cultural differences need not separate men of goodwill. Together
                                    we have laid the material foundations of a new and modern
                                    Viet-Nam in which my people can realize their aspirations.
                                    Together, we have checked the thrust of Communist tyranny in
                                    Southeast Asia. These are great accomplishments and our two
                                    peoples can be rightly proud of them.</item>

                                <item>Like the United States, the Republic of Viet-Nam has always
                                    been devoted to the preservation of peace. My people know only
                                    too well the sorrows of war. We did not sign the 1954 Geneva
                                    Agreements because we could never consent to the partition of
                                    our country and the enslavement of more than half of our people
                                    by Communist tyranny. But we have never considered the
                                    reunification of our nation by force. On the contrary, we have
                                    publicly pledged that we will not violate the demarcation line
                                    and the demilitarized zone set up by the Agreements. We have
                                    always been prepared and <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0638"/>have on many occasions stated our willingness to reunify
                                    Viet-Nam on the basis of democratic and truly free
                                    elections.</item>

                                <item>The record of the Communist authorities in the northern part
                                    of our country is quite otherwise. They not only consented to
                                    the division of VietNam, but were eager for it. They pledged
                                    themselves to observe the Geneva Agreements and during the seven
                                    years since have never ceased to violate them. They call for
                                    free elections but are ignorant of the very meaning of the
                                    words. They talk of “peaceful reunification” and wage war
                                    against us.</item>

                                <item>From the beginning, the Communists resorted to terror in their
                                    efforts to subvert our people, destroy our government, and
                                    impose a Communist regime upon us. They have attacked
                                    defenseless teachers, closed schools, killed members of our
                                    anti-malarial program and looted hospitals. This is coldly
                                    calculated to destroy our Government’s humanitarian efforts to
                                    serve our people.</item>

                                <item>We have long sought to check the Communist attack from the

                                    Commission. Over the years, we have repeatedly published to the
                                    world the evidence of the Communist plot to overthrow our

                                    the publicly stated determination of the Communist authorities
                                    in Hanoi to “liberate the South” by the overthrow of my

                                    people. We cited the proof of massive infiltration of Communist
                                    agents and military elements into our country. We outlined the
                                    Communist strategy, which is simply the ruthless use of terror
                                    against the whole population, women and children

                                <item>In the course of the last few months, the Communist assault on
                                    my people has achieved a new ferocity. In October, they caused
                                    more than 1,800 incidents of violence and more than 2,000
                                    casualties. They have struck occasionally in battalion strength,
                                    and they are continually augmenting their forces by infiltration
                                    from the north. The level of their attacks is already such that
                                    our forces are stretched to the utmost. We are forced to defend
                                    every village, every hamlet, indeed every home against a foe
                                    whose tactic is always to strike at the defenseless.</item>

                                    effort to reconstruct and rehabilitate this area. The Communists
                                    are, of course, making this task doubly difficult, for they have
                                    seized upon the disruption of normal administration and
                                    communications as an opportunity to sow more destruction in the

                                <item>In short, the Vietnamese nation now faces what is perhaps the
                                    gravest crisis in its long history. For more than 2,000 years,
                                    my people have lived and built, fought and died in this land. We
                                    have not always been free. Indeed, much of our history and many
                                    of its proudest moments have arisen from conquest by foreign
                                    powers and our struggle against great odds to regain or defend
                                    our precious independence. But it is not only our freedom which
                                    is at stake today, it is our national identity. For, if we lose
                                    this war, our people will be swallowed by the Communist Bloc,
                                    all our proud heritage will be blotted out by the ’socialist
                                    society,’ and Viet-Nam will leave the pages of history. We will
                                    lose our national soul.</item>

                                <item>Mr. President, my people and I are mindful of the great
                                    assistance which the United States has given us. Your help has
                                    not been lightly received, for the Vietnamese are a proud
                                    people, and we are determined to do our part in the defense of
                                    the Free World. It is clear to all of us that the defeat of the
                                    Viet Cong demands the total mobilization of our Government and
                                    our people, and you may be sure that we will devote all of our
                                    resources of money, minds, and men to this great task.</item>

                                <item>But Viet-Nam is not a great power, and the forces of
                                    International Communism now arrayed against us are more than we
                                    can meet with the resources at hand. We must have further
                                    assistance from the United States if we are to survive the war
                                    now being waged against us.</item>

                                <item>If our request for aid needs any further justification before
                                    the court of world opinion, we need only refer to the Charter of
                                    the United Nations which recognizes the right of self-defense
                                    for all nations. We can certainly assure mankind that our action
                                    is purely defensive. Much as we regret the subjugation of more
                                    than half our people in North VietNam, we have no intention, and
                                    indeed no means, to free them by the use of force.</item>

                                <item>I have said that Viet-Nam is at war. War means many things,
                                    but most of all it means the death of brave people for a cause
                                    they believe in. Viet-Nam has suffered many wars, and through
                                    the centuries, we have always had patriots and heroes who were
                                    willing to shed their blood for VietNam. We will keep faith with
                                    them. When Communism has long ebbed away into the past, my
                                    people will still be here, a free united nation growing from the
                                    deep roots of our Vietnamese heritage. They will remember your
                                        <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0640"/>help in our time of

                                    And your help, your friendship, and the strong bonds between our
                                    two peoples will be a part of VietNam, then as now.”</item>

                            Mission. In past few days there have been press stories inquiring when
                            evidence of increased US support can be expected and continuing express
                            hope either directly or indirectly US forces in some form will be sent
                            to VietNam. Conversations with Assembly Deputies, Government officials
                            and private citizens also indicate some uneasiness at absence to date of

                            In this atmosphere it evident dramatic moves by US would give immediate

                        <p>On political front criticism of government and Diem is growing,
                            especially by people in or close to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            Vice President and Can Lao financial advisor most recent and most
                            striking examples we can cite in this connection. Criticism also appears
                            more open in that there less attempt than before to conceal personal
                            views and even usually strictly controlled newspapers carry occasional
                            barbs against government <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0641"/>methods. Perhaps this reason two papers had articles censored Nov

                        <p>At same time, pattern of possible reformist action beginning to develop
                            openly. Principal goal of extremely moderate group behind this action
                            seems to be creation some sort of supreme war council which, though
                            under President, would exercise much of his present authority and take
                            over many fields of activity he now personally directs. Idea has now
                            been publicly floated in press, has received favorable cross-play and is
                            very much alive.</p>

                        <p>In the next week or ten days <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> will
                            complete a four-month study of the political and foreign policy
                            implications of the new Communist tactics of guerilla warfare and
                                subversion.<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">The completed study has not
                                been found.</note> Done with the help of an outside consultant<note n="4" xml:id="d259fn4">Not identified.</note> who spent three months

                            in <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>, this study is a comprehensive
                            one and it has produced some significant findings.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately the completed <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> study
                            will not be available in time for these findings to be considered in the
                            decision on General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            recommendations, which I understand will be made this coming week. In
                            this memorandum, however, I have tried to select from the study those
                            considerations that seem most immediately relevant to the Viet-Nam
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>In general, the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> study indicates that
                            the most effective way of meeting a guerilla threat like that of the
                            Viet Cong is not with regular troops, but rather by a sophisticated
                            combination of civic action, intelligence, police work, and
                            constabulary-like counter-guerilla forces that use a tactical doctrine
                            quite different from the traditional doctrine of regular forces.</p>
                        <p>The findings of the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> study would
                            support the recommendations you have just made to the President in your
                            memorandum of November 11th.<note n="5" xml:id="d259fn5">Reference is to

                            desirability of certain additional measures as well. A hasty and
                            incomplete catalogue of these additional measures follows.</p>

                            <item><p><hi rend="italic">Police</hi>. There is a great need for, and
                                    potential use of, police forces in South Vietnam. A rapid
                                    buildup of these security forces would supplement, not
                                    duplicate, the work of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and
                                        <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. In certain situations
                                    such a buildup would facilitate the military preparedness
                                    program.</p>
                                <p>Police training can immediately be augmented in two vital
                                    categories-communications and specialized
                                    constabulary-enforcement efforts. The communications field has
                                    already benefited from efforts to establish village alarm
                                    systems and joint security communication systems. This channel
                                    of training and operations should be preserved and
                                    broadened.</p>
                                <p>Vietnam sorely needs a rural police service-with local personnel
                                    stationed in their own provinces, a highway patrol, stronger
                                    urban and prefectural police networks than presently exist, and
                                    additional river and harbor companies. At present surete
                                    municipal, and prefectural police total 22,000. These forces
                                    need further training in police intelligence work and in matters
                                    related to detection of subversion. Their numbers must be
                                    augmented by at least 10,000 if they are to perform all the
                                    necessary functions noted above. This increment can come from
                                    the Civil Guard which numbers 64,000, but only 32,000 are to be
                                    trained by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> within the next
                                    year or so.</p>
                                <p>In certain matters <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is
                                    moving ahead-as in the 17 Boat Platoon program. But it is likely
                                    that the required <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> estimate
                                    of <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0643"/>ten river and harbor
                                    companies is not only essential but can still be considered a
                                    valid program in light of the difficulties in patrol encountered
                                    by the VNN. In any event if AID personnel are available, for
                                    training purposes at the very least, they could be added to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> group to expedite and
                                    broaden the program.</p>
                                <p>Police can play a vital role in rural and highway work. By
                                    remaining in their own provinces, they can keep up good contacts
                                    with the local inhabitants, build confidence, and so serve as a
                                    vital source of intelligence regarding guerilla <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> and locations. This type of
                                    approach has proved particularly effective in Burma and
                                    Indonesia.</p>
                                <p>Moreover such an effort could also have useful effects on the
                                    South Viet-Nam political scene. It would give a rational and
                                    valid base to Diem’s policy of bolstering his Provincial Chiefs.
                                    Since this policy is based in part on a fear of the military and
                                    the concentration of power in its hands, the development of a
                                    separate security force with a legitimate purpose, spread over
                                    the countryside and under the control of his political allies,
                                    might diminish Diem’s hostility to the military and make him
                                    more amenable to accepting our reform recommendations in that
                                    sphere of activity. The fact that the Provincial Chiefs will not
                                    now permit the Civil Guard to be transferred out of their
                                    provinces illustrates the current tension between the government
                                    and the army. So does the Chiefs’ reluctance to permit <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> inspection of the Civil
                                    Guard. An expansion of essential police functions, including the
                                    transfer of untrained Civil Guard personnel to the police field,
                                    might improve the training program as well as facilitate the
                                    integration of the rest of the force into the major military
                                    effort.</p>

                                    participation at the working levels of the Vietnamese armed
                                    forces, not only in plans, operations, intelligence, and
                                    communications, but also in the areas of logistics, supply, and
                                    morale. An effort to increase morale and effectiveness through
                                    an immediate improvement in the general welfare of the enlisted
                                    man (diet, pay, promotion, leaves, awards) requires close and
                                    continual attention. For this effort to succeed, the entire
                                    apparatus of the Vietnamese forces, and not simply the combat
                                    arm, must have American participation that will be both
                                    acceptable and effective.</p>
                                <p>A possible solution which should be considered is the creation of
                                    a parallel U.S. chain of command running alongside the
                                    indigenous forces and ranging from corps level down to the
                                    smallest administrative units. Their purview could include
                                    supervision of training exercises as well as the items noted
                                    above.</p>
                                <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0644"/>
                                <p>Such supervision would be of particular importance in the rapid
                                    enlargement of company grade and non-commissioned officer
                                    cadres. It is essential that the U.S. officers not exercise
                                    command in these activities, but that they and their Vietnamese
                                    counterparts do have the authority to make reports and appeal
                                    matters through their own chains of command to the next highest
                                    echelon in both national organizations. In this way, an American
                                    official could report to his own and to Vietnamese superiors any
                                    failure to follow what he considers to be reasonable and sound
                                    advice. At the minimum, such a liaison system would serve as an
                                    instrument of intelligence and surveillance on the quality of
                                    work done by the armed forces in effecting reform programs, the
                                    level of morale of the enlisted personnel, and the degree of
                                    efficiency obtained as a consequence of the training
                                    program.</p>
                                <p>The possibility of providing sanctions through such a system
                                    might also be investigated. That is, Vietnamese officers who
                                    failed to carry out their tasks could lose their posts or
                                    promotions, and if necessary, U.S. supplies could be made
                                    conditional on the maintenance of proper personnel policy.</p>

                                        Leadership</hi>. The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report notes that each additional
                                    guerilla requires fifteen more government soldiers to engage in
                                    this kind of warfare. Hence as the Viet Cong force reaches a
                                    critical size, it outstrips the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s ability to match forces at the 15:1 ratio.
                                    With the regulars at 170,000, the Civil Guard at 64,000 and the
                                    self defense force at 53,000, the total reaches 282,000 (or
                                    317,000 if the regulars are augmented.) But the Viet Cong is
                                    growing rapidly, and is now estimated at 16,000. Should it
                                    continue to increase at the present rate, it will easily rise
                                    above the accepted ratio, especially if we take into account the
                                    number of ineffectives in the military forces that already swell
                                    the government-force totals.</p>
                                <p>As a consequence, the burden on the quality of the government’s
                                    combat forces is enormous. An all-out effort in training,
                                    tactical conception, leadership and morale are vital if the
                                    situation is to be kept under control. In numerical terms, it is
                                    essential to bring the effective combat ratio down as close to
                                    10:1 as possible.</p>
                                <p>Radical innovation in the organization, doctrine, equipment and
                                    tactical deployment of counter-guerilla forces is a primary
                                    requirement in Vietnam. The <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report notes this major issue and is
                                    quick to analyze the political difficulties involved in the
                                    proper deployment even of those troops that have had special
                                    training.</p>
                                <p>These difficulties must be overcome or the entire project will
                                    remain out of control. Therefore we need to stress the
                                    separation of the Vietnamese equivalent of Special Forces from
                                    the regular army. Since Diem is bound to resist the overall
                                    military reorganization which the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report advocates, it may be wise to start

                                    try to wring from him this specific concession. In this way, the
                                    vital issue of losing control over his whole army will not be at
                                    stake, and the comfort he draws from this might make him more
                                    amenable.</p>
                                <p>In such circumstances, it is essential that we determine what
                                    percentage of the armed forces of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> we wish to treat in this category. Under
                                    present conditions, we should be influenced by considerations of
                                    Diem’s position, the size of such forces trained and immediately
                                    trainable, and the short and medium range military requirements.
                                    The nature and structure of this command, and its relationship
                                    to the rest of the regular army and to the chain of command,
                                    must also be worked out carefully.</p>
                                <p>Though experts differ in several important details, there is a
                                    considerable body of agreement on what constitutes a proper
                                    counter-guerilla effort. The basic unit is a small formation
                                    roughly around 50<note n="7" xml:id="d259fn7">The number “15” is

                                        margin.</note> men in size. This force must be able to fan
                                    out into the countryside, be self-reliant, and be able to
                                    operate autonomously. It must live in the jungle and be prepared
                                    to employ guerilla techniques against guerillas. In the interest
                                    of mobility, its arms must be light, its transport facilities
                                    rudimentary yet efficient, and its communications equipment both
                                    simple and open. Though it must operate apart from other units
                                    and at times deploy itself in decentralized patrols, it must be
                                    able to regroup into large formations when needed. The ability
                                    to disperse and regroup rapidly, much as guerillas themselves
                                    do, is absolutely essential.</p>
                                <p>Leadership is a vital component for these units require brave
                                    determined professionals. The leader must be able to study the
                                    terrain, maintain good relations with the indigenous farming
                                    population, keep up the morale of his men while behind enemy
                                    lines or in a no-man’s jungle, and at the same time be able to
                                    plan ahead and extemporize as a situation develops.</p>
                                <p>Vietnam may be unable to supply leaders of this type immediately,
                                    in the number and quality required. Consequently, the use of
                                    U.S. or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> personnel for
                                    the critical jobs of forming and leading such groups and
                                    training indigenous leaders in Viet-Nam or abroad may afford
                                    results beyond the proportion first apparent from the numbers
                                    and costs involved. American experts, Philippine veterans of the
                                    Huk campaign, and successful field officers from Malaya are all
                                    specially qualified for such a role.</p>

                                    In conjunction with any investigation at the “provincial grass
                                    roots” of the social, political and other factors bearing on the
                                    counter-insurgency problem, we <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0646"/>must repeatedly stress to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> the importance of minimizing
                                    damage to the civilian community in the course of military
                                    operations. Indeed a prime objective of special-force operations
                                    should be to recognize that the struggle goes on within
                                    friendly, or potentially friendly, territory, even though the
                                    enemy is at hand and may have voluntary or involuntary
                                    assistance from the inhabitants of a particular region.</p>
                                <p>A primary requirement is a force disciplined to respect civilian
                                    rights and property. Soldiers must not seize food. They must
                                    take as little as possible and pay for all requisitions. They
                                    must avoid undue damage to property (especially crops and
                                    livestock). They must treat the local inhabitants with respect.
                                    Often how common courtesies are extended is as significant as
                                    the intent. A friendly attitude establishes proper rapport with
                                    the citizenry, maintains the government’s prestige, and often
                                    induces the people to talk to the soldiers and give them
                                    valuable information. Discipline and proper behavior are
                                    especially important when units engage in autonomous operations
                                    free from central control, such as wide-ranging patrols. A
                                    combination of an ineffective sweep and harsh behavior during
                                    its operation ruins a regime’s prestige and diminishes its
                                    intelligence contacts with the people, without which the patrols
                                    themselves are of no value.</p>
                                <p>The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is all too prone to take
                                    repressive measures. Tactically, the operating units on patrol
                                    tend to gain the impression that they are in enemy territory and
                                    they act accordingly. Or, on occasion, the government has bombed
                                    inhabited areas in the central mountains because the ethnic
                                    minorities there have helped sustain Viet Cong forces. Yet this
                                    does not stop those who volunteer such help and seriously
                                    antagonizes others. Saturation of Viet Cong areas with
                                    anti-personnel chemicals is also politically hazardous, since
                                    few entire areas are actually pro Viet Cong.</p>
                                <p>The techniques of operating in guerilla saturated territory, of
                                    establishing contacts with friendly inhabitants, and of
                                    gradually building up a clandestine espionage and political
                                    network, require great skill and training on the part of
                                    experienced counter-guerilla special forces. Experiences in
                                    Vietnam’s Northwest Frontier Region is a good illustration of
                                    the application of unconventional efforts to this problem,
                                    although it would be overly hopeful to expect the Frontier Force
                                    to clear and pacify so difficult a region. The location of the
                                    area close to zones of Viet Cong concentrations and additional
                                    forces from without signify that a much stronger effort will be
                                    needed.</p>

                                    In certain carefully delimited spheres, a combined effort by as
                                    many <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members as are
                                    willing to participate might enhance the overall result sought
                                    in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report. If
                                    the commitment remained at approximately the same level as under

                                    South Viet-Nam might all draw benefits.</p>
                                <p>We have already noted that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members can contribute specialist training
                                    forces and perhaps unit leaders for specific types of combat. In
                                    addition, Thailand and the Philippines might be able to set up
                                    training centers, so that our long-projected concept of a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> counter-guerilla school
                                    might finally be realized as a byproduct of this endeavor.
                                        <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> naval patrols could
                                    aid the hard-pressed VNN in both operations and training.
                                    Experts from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> countries
                                    could participate in the multiple intelligence efforts (training
                                    and operations) stressed in the Report.</p>
                                <p>It might also be possible to send special <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> detachments, of very small
                                    size, to frontier regions as observers, or perhaps to establish
                                    intricate communications and surveillance networks again for
                                    operational and training assistance to the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> officers might man the parallel control
                                    organization noted in No. 2 above if an American presence of
                                    such intensity appears inadvisable. Thai Border Guards, trained
                                    by our own Special Forces, might in turn be able to assist in
                                    the training and operations problems of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Frontier Force.</p>
                                <p>A primary objection to the employment of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> label stems from the
                                    intense Vietnamese distrust of the French, whom they blame for
                                    Kong Le’s defection and a good deal of the trouble in Laos. On
                                    the other hand, France and, to a lesser extent, Britain are the
                                    two powers most likely to oppose any <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> action. To the extent that it is possible,
                                    the rest of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> allies
                                    could decide on a joint ad hoc program, along the level of
                                    intensity suggested in the Report, and proceed without their
                                    European allies. In a sense, this would be a cautious de facto
                                    follow-up of the trial balloon floated by the Thais last summer
                                    when they proposed that <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>’s European members quietly dissociate themselves
                                    from <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> actions if they so
                                    desired.</p>
                                <p>A partial <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> participation,
                                    however moderate at first, could set the stage for the
                                    implementation of its more ambitious efforts, plans 5 or 7<note n="8" xml:id="d259fn8">Neither found.</note> as noted in the
                                    Report. It would set a precedent for the participation of
                                    regional organizations in a defense against indirect aggression.
                                    It would help demonstrate that a besieged land has more of a
                                    choice than capitulation or dependence solely and publicly on
                                    the United States. Since we must bear the brunt of the burden in
                                    any event, the successful invocation of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> participation even on a
                                    partial basis, would enhance our diplomatic and moral position
                                    as well as hopefully relieve some of our direct military
                                    responsibilities.</p>

                                    and civic action, followed by Special Forces as needed, and
                                    regular troops in force should the situation get out of hand.
                                    Thus the first group is literally an entering wedge, available
                                    to facilitate the arrival of the other two, in case of need. The
                                    Report itself notes with approval <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s estimate of that in the event of any of
                                    three contingencies (the seizure of the Kontum area, an assault
                                    on Saigon, a major Vietminh overt assault) we would have to
                                    respond quickly with force already earmarked and deployed for
                                    action. This recommendation fits into the FLAG concept which
                                    requires that the second and third waves and their logistical
                                    support be in position in advance.</p>
                                <p>This leads to the crux of the issue. A force of 8,000 engineers
                                    is of limited value unless it augurs more to come-unless it is a
                                    token of a US commitment that will be honored as needed. The
                                    entering move will evoke protests from disaffected groups in
                                    Saigon as well as from neighboring neutrals. The legality of an
                                    intervention based on the appeal of a sovereign state does not
                                    end our political difficulties, as the Lebanon episode
                                    demonstrated.</p>
                                <p>An engineering force is of little value once its immediate job is
                                    done. Its continued presence after the original task is
                                    completed will bring more political costs. There would be new
                                    political consequences from its withdrawal. Yet of itself, it
                                    has not assured or facilitated, except in a marginal way, the
                                    possible further commitment of US combat troops. We must, at the
                                    outset contemplate the possible need to follow through with this
                                    further effort, should the need arise. Otherwise we might finish
                                    in a worse diplomatic and strategic posture than if we had not
                                    sent any units in to begin with.</p>
                                <p>There is a further danger that our initial move may be considered
                                    out of context, as one of a series of possible measures we could
                                    take, graded in intensity and separate from one another. Some
                                    recent American contingency studies have already placed the
                                    engineer commitment in that category. The idea that such a move
                                    of itself will automatically boost <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> morale-although admittedly the move is of
                                    little use against the Viet Cong-is difficult to support. It
                                    will be even more difficult to support should the situation
                                    worsen. <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0649"/>We should
                                    recognize that a major indication of this sort makes it very
                                    difficult for us to withdraw. It should be undertaken only as
                                    part of a more fundamental decision to follow through with a
                                    Korean-scale action if need be, and to begin recruiting and
                                    deploying troops accordingly.</p>
                                <p>Since the flood repair operation is essential in its own right,
                                    we could devise alternate methods of approach. A mixed U.S.
                                    army-civilian force could perform the basic tasks, with the
                                    military aspects played down. A <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> operation along the “economic help” line
                                    devised in recent years could be mounted, while still pointing
                                    up the diplomatic-military overtones to the Communist Bloc.
                                    Finally, we could call upon various interested agencies for
                                    technical and expert help-ECAFE for broad-based <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-oriented economic surveys, WHO
                                    for health control, as well as FAO for food stocks.</p>

                            <item><p>Stress on Provinces for Political Effort Since Diem has
                                    fostered the influence of the Provincial Chiefs in order to
                                    reduce the centralized authority of the military-at great cost
                                    in military efficiency (in planning, command, field
                                    communications, and coordination)-he is not likely to suffer
                                    loss of direct political influence “at the bottom” lightly.
                                    Under such circumstances, the establishment of the provinces as
                                    sources of power apart from Diem will be a most difficult
                                    undertaking. Such a loss would not only deprive Diem of direct
                                    authority, but would lead him to feel that his main bulwark
                                    against the military in Saigon was disintegrating.</p>
                                <p>Since the provincial approach has the advantage of reform at the
                                    source as well as possibilities for immediate impact, it must be
                                    preserved. However to the fullest extent possible, it must be
                                    couched in terms that eliminate the possibility that Diem is
                                    conspicuously losing his authority-an outcome which few rulers
                                    have proved willing to countenance even in the national
                                    interest. Hence the approach can succeed only if it is couched
                                    in terms of building up the channel of power Diem himself
                                    favored originally and of strengthening it as a counterweight to
                                    the military. The establishment of a more adequate provincial
                                    administration, the development of a police force, and the
                                    emergence of a provincial government sympathetic and responsive
                                    to peasant needs will indeed strengthen the civilian branch of
                                    the government. (The military status of the Provincial Chiefs
                                    is, as noted in the report, a device to control the armed forces
                                    and prevent the evolution of their autonomous power.)</p>
                                <p>This touches on a fundamental problem we face in all
                                    underdeveloped lands, especially those with high military
                                    threats or advanced military posture. The military area of the
                                    government, thanks to outside help, is usually educated, trained
                                    and equipped for [far?] beyond the state’s ability to sustain
                                    such an effort. The military <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0650"/>leaders, especially if indoctrinated in the
                                    civic action concept, possess some technical competence in the
                                    area of civilian action. They soon arrogate to themselves the
                                    moral and political right to judge the honesty, adequacy and
                                    modernity of a government. From here to a coup, as was tried in
                                    Vietnam, is a small, logical step.</p>
                                <p>We have an obligation in Viet-Nam and elsewhere to bolster the
                                    civilian components of the government. An enhancement of
                                    civilian power and prestige in Saigon and in the provinces will
                                    do much to offset the fear of the military so prevalent in
                                    Diem’s thinking. If our efforts improve provincial rule
                                    (especially in keeping the government on good terms with
                                    peasants who have to be resettled for strategic reasons like the
                                    Meo, or because of the flood) and loosen Diem’s control over the
                                    provinces at the same time, the results will be a three-fold
                                    bonus. In light of the dangerous situation in Saigon, the move
                                    to broaden the base of political power should be coupled with a
                                    strengthening of the civilian bureaucracy. These are vital
                                    preconditions for the struggle ahead, and they would probably
                                    insure the loyalty and subordination of the military leadership.
                                    The latter could then be given the coordinating and command
                                    authority so desperately needed.</p>

                        <p>As I understand it, we and the Vietnamese will announce that we are no
                            longer bound by certain provisions of the Geneva Accords. (This subject
                            is not covered in yesterday’s messages to Saigon; <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0651"/><note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">See <ref target="#d257">Document 257</ref> and <ref target="#d260fn2">footnote 2</ref> thereto.</note> I don’t know why.) We believe

                            establish that North Viet Nam as well as we are violating the
                            Accords.…</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, when we announce that we are no longer bound by the
                            Accords the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> will be pretty well
                            washed up in Viet Nam. To hope that following such an event it will
                            become a much more effective instrument for the sole purpose of
                            establishing North Viet Nam as an aggressor seems to me quite
                            optimistic. Perhaps the Indians… have indicated that they will take the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> more seriously, but did he
                            commit himself to such action in the context of a decision by the U.S.
                            to state that it is no longer bound by the Accords? … How much of value
                            can we hope to get out of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>? At
                            best, we might get a judgment by the Indian and Canadian members
                            substantiating some of the Vietnamese charges against North Viet Nam. It
                            would be an important advance which would help us establish the basis
                            for current and future U.S. actions,.…</p>

                                carrying out of those decisions and in deliberations on further

                        <p>I have reviewed General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s
                            report on Viet-Nam and the proposed action documents stemming from it
                            (draft instructions to Embassy Saigon and draft letter from President
                            Diem to President <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0652"/><persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>).<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3">Drafts of telegram 619 to Saigon (see <ref target="#d257fn2">footnote 2, Document 257</ref>) and the letter quoted in <ref target="#d257">Document 257</ref>.</note> Attached is a
                            memorandum (Tab <gloss target="#t_A1">A</gloss>) which examines the
                            proposed actions from the legal point of view. This memorandum concludes
                            that, apart from any measures involving military operations deep into
                            North VietNam, the proposed actions do not present legal problems
                            incapable of being dealt with and surmounted. The memorandum suggests
                            some changes that ought to be made in the planning for these actions if
                            it is decided to proceed with the general course plotted out by the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission. These
                            changes would be designed to improve the defensibility of our actions
                            and to avoid consequences that would be prejudicial to the interests of
                            South Viet-Nam and the United States. There is also (Tab <gloss target="#t_B1">B</gloss>)<note n="4" xml:id="d261fn4">Not

                            draft letter from President Diem.</p>
                        <p>Thus, apart from the possibility of long-range attacks into North
                            VietNam, the issues in deciding on our future course of action are
                            essentially political. But we must remember that the extent to which
                            resort to direct self-help, rather than to the procedures and
                            institutions for peaceful settlement of international problems, has an
                            important bearing on the prospects and effectiveness of the rule of law
                            in the world. Because of my deep concern with these matters, I should
                            like to give you my thoughts on the less technically legal issues in
                            relation to VietNam.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s analysis of the
                            situation in South Viet-Nam shows that the basic causes of deterioration
                            and threatened collapse of non-Communist authority are not military but
                            political. But the remedies proposed would undertake to cope with the
                            situation principally by military and semi-military means. The central
                            feature of the course would be the initial introduction of substantial
                            numbers of United States troops to help in pacifying the country. It is
                            said that to embark on this course we must be prepared to escalate, if
                            necessary, to the dimensions of a Korea-type conflict. In assessing the
                            prospects for this course the long history of attempts to prop up
                            unpopular governments through the use of foreign military forces is
                            powerfully discouraging. The French experience in this very area, as
                            well as our own efforts since 1955, reveal the essential inadequacy of
                            the sort of program now proposed. The drawbacks of such intervention in
                            Viet-Nam now would be compounded, not relieved, by the United States
                            penetration and assumption of co-responsibility at all levels of the
                            Vietnamese Government suggested in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report.</p>
                        <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0653"/>
                        <p>In my view, a more promising course of action would be to seek to
                            internationalize the problem with a view to a negotiated settlement or a
                            United Nations solution. I believe we should take advantage of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s presence at
                            Geneva and his working relations with <persName corresp="#p_PGM1">Pushkin</persName> to sound out the Soviets on the possibility of a
                            negotiated settlement in VietNam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> has discussed this problem with me and has
                            shown me the memorandum which he has given you on this subject.<note n="5" xml:id="d261fn5">Apparently a reference to <ref target="#d239">Document 239</ref>.</note> I concur generally in his
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>If Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s efforts
                            should produce no affirmative result we should also consider the
                            advisability of taking the Viet-Nam problem to the United Nations. We
                            would particularly seek to establish in the United Nations the facts of
                            foreign intervention in VietNam, and to enlist the United Nations’
                            assistance in protecting the independence and integrity of VietNam.
                            Attached at Tab C<note n="6" xml:id="d261fn6">Not printed.</note> is a
                            memorandum outlining a course of action in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>You have often said with reference to the Berlin question that, in view
                            of the magnitude of the stakes, we owe it to ourselves, to the American
                            people and to our allies and associates in the free world, to exhaust
                            the possibilities of a negotiated or peaceful settlement which will be
                            consistent with our interests and responsibilities. The alternative to
                            such a settlement is no less grave in Southeast Asia.</p>

                            <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s Report on
                                Viet-Nam recommends among other things that additional United States
                                military personnel and equipment be introduced into South Viet-Nam
                                to provide increased airlift, for expanded intelligence operations,
                                for naval surveillance activities, and to expedite training and
                                equipping of South Vietnamese military and civil guard elements. The
                                question of whether additional United States forces should be
                                introduced even to the extent of a Korea-type operation and whether
                                we may eventually have to attack the source of guerilla aggression
                                in North Viet-Nam is also discussed.</p>
                            <p>It has been suggested in connection with the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report that because South
                                Viet-Nam did not sign the Geneva Accords, it is not <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0654"/>bound by them. In any case, it is
                                said, North Vietnamese violations of the Accords have made them
                                inoperative, and the Accords can be ignored by South Viet-Nam in
                                taking actions to meet the present danger. In addition, it has been
                                suggested that the right of self-defense under the United Nations
                                Charter can be invoked to justify actions now contemplated by the
                                United States in South VietNam.</p>
                            <p>The legal implications of these proposed actions and suggested
                                rationale are discussed below. As with all legal principles, the
                                application of the particular principles of law discussed herein
                                depends upon the facts of the case. One of the steps necessary to
                                the successful development and projection of our case in the
                                international forum is a much fuller development than presently
                                exists of the facts concerning external interference in VietNam,
                                such as those disclosed in the Jorden Report. We must remain
                                continuously alert to ways in which facts that bring the legal
                                principles into operation-such as the facts of external
                                interference-can be gathered from reliable sources and persuasively
                                presented.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">1954 Geneva Accords</hi></p>
                            <p>This office has never accepted the argument that South Viet-Nam is
                                not bound by the Geneva Accords of 1954 because it did not sign
                                them. While the representative of South Viet-Nam did not sign the
                                agreement and in fact protested against certain provisions in it, it
                                was signed by the French on behalf of the French Union Forces, and
                                since the State of Viet-Nam was part of the French Union it would
                                seem to be bound by the French signature. The agreement relating to
                                Laos was similarly signed on behalf of the French Union Forces
                                without a Laotian signature, yet we have always considered the
                                Kingdom of Laos bound by the Accords. South Viet-Nam can also be
                                considered bound by the Accords as a successor state to France. In
                                any event the argument to the contrary leads to very undesirable
                                consequences, for if the South Vietnamese are not parties to the
                                Accords and not bound by them, they would seem to have no legal
                                basis for demanding compliance by the Viet Minh with obligations
                                under the Accords such as respect for the demarcation line and the
                                cease-fire.</p>
                            <p>Unlike VietNam, the United States did not become a party to the
                                Accords. It issued a unilateral declaration stating that it would
                                refrain from the threat or use of force to disturb them and that it
                                would view any renewal of aggression in violation of the Accords
                                with grave concern and as seriously threatening international peace
                                and security.</p>
                            <p>The Geneva Accords prohibit the introduction into Viet-Nam of foreign
                                troop reinforcements, additional military personnel and increased
                                    <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0655"/>amounts of war
                                material. In the absence of adequate legal justification,
                                introduction of United States military personnel and equipment as
                                envisaged in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                Report would therefore, in our view, be a violation of the Accords
                                by South VietNam. Such action would not be inconsistent with the
                                unilateral declaration of the United States, since it would not
                                constitute the threat or use of force to upset the Accords.
                                Nevertheless, again in the absence of adequate legal justification,
                                the United States would be aiding and abetting violations by South
                                VietNam.</p>
                            <p>Justifications for the actions presently contemplated may be found in
                                general principles of international law governing treaties. Under
                                these principles, a material breach of a treaty by one party
                                entitles the other either to suspend the operation of the entire
                                agreement or at least to withhold compliance with an equivalent,
                                corresponding or related provision until resumption of observance by
                                the other party. The Viet Minh have violated the Geneva Accords by
                                directing, assisting and engaging in active hostilities in South
                                Viet-Nam and presumably by illegal introduction into North Viet-Nam
                                of military personnel and war materials.</p>
                            <p>Justification of suspension of certain parts of the Geneva Accords
                                would gain force in the present context from the fact that actions
                                contemplated by the Government of Viet-Nam which might be said to
                                contravene the Accords can be related to the requirements of
                                legitimate self-defense necessitated by the breaches of the other
                                party.</p>
                            <p>Thus, under the applicable principles, we would have the option of
                                suspending the agreement in toto or of withholding compliance with
                                appropriate provisions. In our judgment, the United States and South
                                Viet-Nam should choose the latter course, since we will wish to
                                assert the continuing force of a number of obligations which the
                                Viet-Minh have undertaken under the Accords. The demarcation line
                                itself between North and South Viet-Nam is established by the
                                Accords, as is the requirement for the general cessation of
                                hostilities. It should be recognized, however, that the adoption of
                                this course imposes upon us some obligation to keep our response
                                appropriately related to the infractions of the other side.</p>
                            <p>Though we believe that the introduction of additional military forces
                                and equipment into South Viet-Nam for the purposes described at the
                                beginning of this memorandum would be justified at law, there is no
                                doubt that the Communists will claim, and with a certain
                                plausibility, that South Viet-Nam has violated the Accords, aided
                                and abetted by the United States. To the extent that the
                                contemplated measures can be cast in the form of assistance and
                                training to police and constabulary forces rather than the
                                introduction <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0656"/>and training
                                of regular troops, the persuasive force of these complaints will be
                                lessened.</p>

                            <p>Assuming that the Geneva Accords are not a barrier to actions
                                contemplated in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                Report, the question arises as to whether there are any other legal
                                obstacles to such actions under general international law or the
                                United Nations Charter.</p>
                            <p>International law permits the United States to introduce its forces
                                into South Viet-Nam at the invitation of the Government of Viet-Nam
                                to assist that Government in quelling insurgent activities having
                                substantial external support, inspiration or direction. There is
                                nothing in the United Nations Charter that prohibits such
                                action.</p>
                            <p>In 1958, at the invitation of the President of Lebanon, and in
                                circumstances of alleged indirect aggression against the Government
                                of Lebanon by outside forces or governments, United States troops
                                were sent to Lebanon. President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> explained that this action was taken in
                                part “to encourage the Lebanese Government in defense of Lebanese
                                sovereignty and integrity.”</p>
                            <p>As in the Lebanese situation, however, we should be prepared to
                                defend United States action in Viet-Nam in an international forum
                                such as the United Nations, whether the question is brought there at
                                our own or someone else’s initiative.</p>

                            <p>As to the problem of attacking the source of guerilla aggression in
                                North Viet-Nam there are two currently relevant categories of fact
                                situations: <list>
                                    <label>1)</label>
                                    <item>The first category relates to operations undertaken
                                        against bases near the border in North Viet-Nam and Laos
                                        which are being used as a sanctuary and for supply purposes
                                        by the Viet Cong. It would seem justifiable under
                                        international law principles relating to hot pursuit to
                                        follow the enemy across the border and attempt to destroy
                                        his bases of operations adjacent to the border. Such
                                        operations would have to be appropriately related to the act
                                        provoking them, proportionate in their effects and limited
                                        to action necessary to obtain relief.</item>
                                    <label>2)</label>
                                    <item>The second category consists of direct attacks against
                                        Hanoi and similar strategic centers deep inside North
                                        VietNam. In the absence of overt aggression by means of
                                        armed attack against South VietNam, such action would go
                                        beyond permissible self-defense under general international
                                        law and would be contrary to the United Nations
                                        Charter.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>The right of individual or collective self-defense referred to in
                                Article 51 of the Charter can be invoked only in the event of an
                                armed attack. The term “armed attack” as used in the Charter is <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0657"/>generally understood as a
                                direct external attack upon one country by the armed forces of
                                another such as the German invasion of Poland in 1939 or the North
                                Korean attack on South Korea in 1950. Armed attack is a form of
                                aggression. “Aggression” is a broader concept, covering a range of
                                actions by which one state may threaten the territorial integrity or
                                political independence of another. This difference is recognized in
                                international law generally, in the United Nations Charter and in
                                our mutual defense treaties. In the latter the term “armed attack”
                                has been expressly or implicitly limited to exclude indirect
                                aggression.</p>
                            <p>An essential element in determining whether an action constitutes an
                                “armed attack” is the factor of time. An armed attack is an action
                                which occurs swiftly, requiring immediate measures to ward it off.
                                The “armed attack” envisaged under Article 51 of the Charter is an
                                attack which requires immediate measures of self-defense, measures
                                which cannot await the action of the United Nations but which must
                                be undertaken at once. By the same token “armed attack” under such
                                agreements as the North Atlantic Treaty, the Southeast Asia Treaty,
                                and the Rio Treaty implies a situation in which a response is
                                required before the normal consultative procedures can be availed
                                of.</p>
                            <p>Article 2(4) of the Charter prohibits any use of force by a United
                                Nations member in its international relations which is inconsistent
                                with the purposes of the United Nations. Article 51 of the Charter
                                recognizes the right of individual or collective use of force in
                                self-defense against armed attack without waiting for steps to be
                                taken by any United Nations organ. In cases of aggression that fall
                                short of armed attack, however, it would not be consistent with the
                                purposes of the United Nations for the United States as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member to proceed to the use of armed
                                force to defeat acts which it considers aggressive. In such cases,
                                it would be incumbent upon a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                member to bring the matter first to the attention of the United
                                Nations organization for its consideration and judgment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Chairman:</hi> I have now had a chance to
                            study your most recent two letters on the German problem and on Laos and
                            Vietnam. I shall be writing you again about Germany and Berlin,<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">For texts, see <ref target="frus1961-63v06#d23"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            give you my thoughts about Laos and Viet-Nam as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>In writing to you, I am conscious of the difficulties you and I face in
                            establishing full communication between our two minds. This is not a
                            question of translation but a question of the context in which we hear
                            and respond to what each other has to say. You and I have already
                            recognized that neither of us will convince the other about our
                            respective social systems and general philosophies of life. These
                            differences create a great gulf in communication because language cannot
                            mean the same thing on both sides unless it is related to some
                            underlying common purpose. I cannot believe that there are not such
                            common interests between the Soviet and the American people. Therefore,
                            I am trying to penetrate our ideological differences in order to find
                            some bridge across the gulf on which we could bring our minds together
                            and find some way in which to protect the peace of the world.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow three paragraphs on the situation in Laos; for text, see
                                <ref target="frus1961-63v06#d25"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                        <p>As to the situation in Vietnam, I must tell you frankly that your
                            analysis of the situation there and the cause of the military action
                            which has occurred in Southern Viet-Nam is not accurate. Precisely
                            because of the visit of such Americans as Vice President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> we are, as you yourself
                            recognize, well informed as to the situation in that country. I do not
                            wish to argue with you concerning the government structure and policies
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, but I
                            would like to cite for your consideration the evidence of external
                            interference or incitement which you dismiss in a phrase.</p>
                        <p>I would draw your attention to a letter sent by the Government of
                            Viet-Nam to the International Control Commission concerning the North
                            Viet-Nam subversion and aggression against Vietnam, dated October 24,
                                1961.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Not printed. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 751K.00/11-861)</note> I would urge that you should
                            read this document very carefully since it contains evidence of a
                            planned and consistent effort on the part of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to overthrow by violence the <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0659"/>legitimate government of South Vietnam.
                            I would like to add that the evidence contained in this document is
                            known to the United States to be accurate and sober. Many more incidents
                            of the type outlined in this document could be deduced from our own
                            experience and our own direct knowledge. I might point out here that in
                            effect from 1954, the signature of the Geneva Accords, until 1959, the
                            situation in Viet-Nam was relatively tranquil. The country was effecting
                            a limited recovery from the ravages of the civil war from which it had
                            just emerged. The Government enjoyed the support of the people and the
                            prospects for the future appeared reasonably bright. However, in 1959,
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> having failed in the elections
                            which had been held in Viet-Nam and in the attempt to arouse the people
                            against their legitimate government, turned to a calculated plan of open
                            infiltration, subversion, and aggression. During the Third Party
                            Congress of the Lao Dong Party the Secretary General Le Duan stated:
                            “There does not exist any other way outside of that which consists in
                            the overthrow of the dictatorial and Fascist regime of the
                            American-Diemist clique in order to liberate totally South Vietnam, with
                            a view to realizing national unity.” As indicated in the document to
                            which I have referred, you will find this statement in the Nhan Dan,
                            Hanoi Daily Number 2362 of September 6, 1960.</p>
                        <p>It is the firm opinion of the United States Government that Southern
                            Viet-Nam is now undergoing a determined attempt from without to
                            overthrow the existing government using for this purpose infiltration,
                            supply of arms, propaganda, terrorization, and all the customary
                            instrumentalities of communist activities in such circumstances, all
                            mounted and developed from North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary for me to draw your attention to the Geneva
                            Accords of July 20-21, 1954. The issue, therefore, is not that of some
                            opinion or other in regard to the government of President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo Dinh Diem</persName>, but rather that of a
                            nation whose integrity and security is threatened by military actions,

                            appear to warrant. Since there is no semblance of any threat to the

                            is clear that if the DRV were honorably <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0660"/>to discharge the obligations it undertook in the Geneva
                            Accords, the prospects for peace would be improved. I would, therefore,
                            venture to suggest that you, as the head of a government which was a
                            signatory to the Geneva Accords, should use all the influence that you
                            possess and endeavor to bring the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to
                            the strict observance of these Accords. This would be a great act in the
                            cause of peace which you refer to as the essence of the policies of the
                            Twenty-second Party Congress. If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            were to abide by its obligations under the Geneva Accords, there would
                            be no need for the United States to consider, as we must at the present,
                            how best to support the Government of Viet-Nam in its struggle for
                            independence and national integrity.</p>
                        <p>I have written you frankly about Laos and Viet-Nam for a very simple
                            reason. Both these countries are at a distance from our own countries
                            and can be considered areas in which we ought to be able to find
                            agreement. I am suggesting to you that you use every means at your
                            disposal to insure a genuinely neutral and independent Laos, as those
                            words are commonly understood throughout the world, and to insure that
                            those closely associated with you leave South Viet-Nam alone. On our
                            part, we shall work toward a neutral and independent Laos and will
                            insure that North Viet-Nam not be the object of any direct or indirect
                            aggression. This would be a step toward peace; I am reluctant to believe
                            that there is any necessary alternative to be imposed upon my country by
                            the actions of others.</p>

                        <p>At a press conference on November 17, 1961, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> made an introductory statement
                            about several issues, including Vietnam. He said that the accelerated
                            North Vietnamese campaign to overthrow the South Vietnamese Government
                            was “a threat to the peace” and was “of major and serious concern not
                            only to the people of Viet-Nam and their immediate neighbors but also to
                            all other free nations.” The Secretary noted that there had also been
                            “an acceleration <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0661"/>of deliveries
                            under our mutual defense assistance program” to South Viet-Nam and that
                            some changes could be expected “in the nature of our training under the
                            military advisory and training program .…” For the complete text of the

                        </list>
                        <p>It seems to me that if we are going to cope successfully with charges
                            that we are engaged in germ or poison gas warfare, we must make the
                            general character of the operations as open and above board as possible.
                            Would it be possible to get the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to
                            examine every drum of the defoliant mixture to determine that it is what
                            we say it is? If we are going to pursue the policy of letting the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> find out itself whether we are
                            violating the Geneva Accords, this may be impossible. It may be
                            difficult, in any event, to get the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            to agree to any such action. An alternative approach would be to bring
                            in some other international group or perhaps a group of private
                            scientists. Publicity ought to emphasize the fact (I believe it is a
                            fact) that the chemical agents involved are the same kind that are used
                            by farmers against weeds.</p>
                        <p>I think that the adverse political consequences of the operation would
                            also be less if this is not the first concrete move that is announced in
                            connection with our stepped-up effort in Viet Nam. If it could be put in
                            the context of a comprehensive story of what we plan to do and why we
                            plan to do it, we shall be much better off. There is some danger that
                            North Viet Nam, which has already got hold of our general plans and
                            begun a propaganda operation, can exploit this operation to the point
                            where its propaganda would be a quite effective backfire against our
                            subsequent charges of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> involvement in
                            the South.</p>
                        <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0662"/>
                        <p>It seems to me important that this question be got to the President on an
                            urgent basis, possibly this weekend, no later than Monday.<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">November 20.</note> If we are not going ahead we
                            ought to stop our preparatory efforts quickly. Otherwise we may pay many
                            of the political costs while reaping no military advantages.</p>
                        <p>The cost estimates on this program seem to have gone upward continuously.
                            Whereas earlier this week I understood that the total cost was on the
                            order of $4 million ($1 million for chemicals and $3 million for air
                            transport), I now understand that it may be on the order of $10-15
                            million. This estimate is for just the initial phase operation-the
                            attack on the food supplies. Other estimates have put total possible
                            cost of the three-phase program at $70 million or more. I think that
                            these figures raise serious questions with respect to the comparative
                            value of this as opposed to other measures we might take in Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>As you probably know, subsequent phases would involve selective
                            defoliation in <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> and of the
                            communications routes between Saigon and other key cities and
                            defoliation along the Cambodian border. If I understand a recent
                            Department telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d264fn3">Telegram 582 to Saigon,
                                November 10. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                751K.00/11-961)</note> correctly, we have in mind defoliating an
                            area near, but not on, the border, but at a constant distance from it.
                            Will this accomplish the purpose?</p>
                        <p>I am not certain whether the President is being asked to approve all
                            three phases. Politically, the defoliation of areas around <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> and along the roads to the
                            principal cities would seem to present least difficulties. If we should
                            decide against the operation directed at <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> crops, we might still decide to go ahead with <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> and roadside operation. The
                            principal political danger in it may be to turn non-Communist villagers
                            whose crops are accidentally destroyed against the government. That is,
                            of course, one of the political drawbacks of all three proposed
                            phases.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend that, since State and Defense are now to discuss the

                            Deny food to Viet Cong units; establish a denuded area along Viet-Nam
                            borders (with Cambodia, or Laos, or both) to check Viet Cong
                            infiltration. Also listed are negative factors, mainly psychological,
                            which should be taken into consideration in the decision-making
                            process.</p>
                        <p>The status of this controversial subject thus is: The Government of
                            VietNam, the U.S. Country Team in Saigon and the Department of Defense
                            urge employment of defoliant as an effective tactic to hinder Viet Cong
                            depredations. In proposing the action, consideration <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0664"/>was given to so-called public relations
                            or psychological factors. For instance, tests on foliage in or around
                            Saigon would be made publicly to demonstrate that the chemicals employed
                            are not harmful to humans and animals; the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself would mount a publicity campaign explaining the
                            security benefits which would accrue; unmarked aircraft piloted by
                            “civilians” would be employed in spraying flights to guard against
                            charges that “American military adventurists” are involved; etc.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know whether the following factors have been taken into
                            consideration thus far in the decision-making process in Washington: <list>

                                <item>The use of chemical weaponry in an Asian country could create
                                    such a storm of criticism that possible short-range military
                                    advantages on the ground in Viet-Nam might be outweighed by a
                                    harvest of ill-will deleterious to certain long-ranged goals in
                                    Viet-Nam and the region (Southeast Asia).</item>

                                    capital of this undertaking by “the U.S. and its stooge Diem.”
                                    We all recall the propaganda circus created by the communists on
                                    alleged U.S. use of “germ warfare” in Korea on the basis of
                                    fabricated evidence.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I am no military strategist or tactician, although I did learn a few
                            things about chemical or bacteriological warfare (most of it harrassing)
                            at the Air War College. Perhaps defoliation can be a critical factor in
                            exposing Viet Cong strongholds and destroying Viet Cong food supplies.
                            If it is, and must be used, we can take the psychological bumps which
                            are certain to be dealt to us. But the spectre of charges that “U.S.
                            imperialists are waging germ warfare on Asians” haunts me.</p>
                        <p>The decision is to be left to the President. I recommend you discuss the
                            subject in its varied ramifications with <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>.</p>

                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s decisions on
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> report <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0665"/>concerning <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. President Diem had interrupted inspection trip in
                            central Viet Nam to return to Saigon to receive me. Interview lasted two
                            and one-half hours; was candid, direct, and fundamental.</p>
                        <p>I read from, and later expanded on, paper<note n="3" xml:id="d266fn3">No
                                copy of this paper has been found.</note> prepared from instructions
                            reftels. Stressed theme of partnership requiring far-reaching and
                            difficult measures on both sides. Left Diem to do some hard thinking of
                            his own on required <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions, and did
                            not at this stage present list of specifics with respect <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reorganization.</p>
                        <p>I gave him detailed outline of proposed US actions contained paras 1, 5
                            and 6 of <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss><note n="4" xml:id="d266fn4">i.e., telegram 619.</note> and, for precision, left
                            him paper containing full substance sub-paras H through J para 1, less
                                <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> portion sub-para <gloss target="#t_G1">G</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I believe I made it unmistakably clear, and repeated the point several
                            times, that US readiness to go ahead with proposed joint effort depends
                            heavily on his coming up with proposed <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> actions in administrative, political and social fields
                            which will be recognized as having real substance and meaning. I urged
                            that he let me know as soon as possible his ideas on this point, as well
                            as on our proposal as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Diem promised to do so and did not at this stage attempt to give a
                            considered reaction to our proposal. As anticipated, his first question
                            was re introduction US combat troops. I replied along lines para 4
                                <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> and pointed out that
                            measures set out paras 1A, B and C would involve US uniformed military
                            personnel in roles which could expose them to enemy action. In response
                            to Diem’s question he [<hi rend="italic">I?</hi>] said that in my
                            personal opinion these personnel would be authorized to defend
                            themselves if attacked. I pointed out that this was one reason why the
                            decisions were very grave from US standpoint and why we needed
                            substantial <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> response on actions it
                            proposed to take.</p>
                        <p>Diem said that he presumed I realized that our proposals involved the
                            question of the responsibility of the Government of Viet Nam. Viet Nam,
                            he said, did not want to be a protectorate.</p>
                        <p>I said that this was well understood; we for our part did not wish to
                            make it one. Diem also pointed out that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> was constantly in process of making reforms but major
                            action could not be taken without thorough consideration and without
                            having always in mind that there was a war to be won. Object was to
                            restore order, not to create disorder. I said I recognized that this was
                            a delicate judgment; in my opinion, as a friend of his country and of
                            him, his greater risk was to stand pat, or act too cautiously. It was my
                            sincere belief that it would be possible for him to streamline his
                            government <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0666"/>and delegate
                            authority to a greater extent and, in addition, to take into the
                            government and into his confidence capable people who are now sitting on
                            the sidelines. In past he had told me that he had tried latter without
                            success but I believed that if he tried once again and offered real
                            responsibility to people on sidelines at this critical juncture, it
                            would have great quieting effect on whole country. The President did not
                            respond directly on this point. He did expatiate at length on the
                            difficulty of finding people willing to accept responsibility, on the
                            shortage of trained and able people, on the effects on the people of 80
                            years of French colonial rule, and on the mentality and habits of the
                            Vietnamese people-a theme on which he has often elaborated in the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, I am not discouraged at Diem’s reaction. In fact, he took
                            our proposals rather better than I had expected. He has promised to call
                            me as soon as he has been able to reflect upon our proposals and, until
                            we have heard his considered reaction, I think it would be idle to
                            speculate on outcome. He requested copy of paper from which I read and
                            talked, which I am sending him. He said he would ask his Cabinet for
                            ideas.</p>
                        <p>I urge that every possible effort be made to avoid leaks on nature of our
                            proposals, particularly the “quid pro quo” aspects, in interest of
                            getting result we desire.</p>

                            policy approach re Geneva Accords is that we need not confirm to world
                            that we disregarding Accords by increased aid to Viet-Nam and that
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should counter charges violation
                            not by admission but by counter-charging <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> violations and insisting on <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> investigations of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>

                        <p>We agree with this approach as far as it goes, but believe that further
                            development of our Geneva Accords position is necessary in order enable
                            US meet (a) political need of reassuring Vietnamese public and
                            preventing further morale deterioration through provision more
                            information as to what US has been doing in way military assistance to
                            Viet-Nam during past few months and, as decisions reached in future,
                            what additional steps we are taking, and (b) desirability maintaining
                            with local US correspondents reasonable status of credibility which now
                            seriously stretched by our continued insistence US military personnel
                            still within 685 ceiling. (c) Believe also that if and when US military
                            personnel are given certain operational functions in Vietnam, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> may find it desirable to let American

                            we had right to go up to 888, since French had at least that number
                            training personnel in Viet-Nam when Geneva Accords concluded.

                        <p>Believe we should inform Canadians and Indians bilaterally (not through

                            this is essentially line we intended to take some months ago but
                            Canadians in Saigon objected and said Indians would not go along.
                            However, in light Washington discussions with Nehru, we would hope
                            Indians would now be more forthcoming. (Have discussed here with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GJK1">Galbraith</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>Seems desirable at present time avoid any reference to our “right” to
                            replace French combat troops (who amounted to about 150,000 in 1954),
                            because this would probably make it tactically harder to sell Indians

                            in reserve for future use if needed.</p>
                        <p>In eventual publicity which we might undertake after establishing 3,500
                            justifications with Indians and Canadians, we do not think we would need
                            to be rigidly careful to state publicly that all American military
                            personnel in Viet-Nam are trainers and advisers only, but neither should
                            be strident in stating that they are not. We believe that case by case
                            decision as to what to state publicly would be best method, and that
                            Embassy Saigon should be consulted in each case prior public
                            announcements anywhere. Since it is likely we shall want to show that
                            some American personnel are “operational” (such as projected helicopter
                            crews), we should be prepared meet possible argument by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Poles that this shows de facto
                            military alliance in violation Article 19 Geneva Accords.<note n="4" xml:id="d268fn4">Article 19 reads: “With effect from the date of
                                entry into force of the present Agreement, no military base under
                                the control of a foreign State may be established in the re-grouping
                                zone of either party; the two parties shall ensure that the zones
                                assigned to them do not adhere to any military alliance and are not
                                used for the resumption of hostilities or to further an aggressive
                                policy.” (Ibid.)</note> Believe our best way of meeting this if it
                            arises would be to point out that as far as US is legally concerned only
                            written treaty signed and ratified by two-thirds of Senate constitutes
                            military alliance and that does not exist in case Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate Department’s early reaction to above. If Department
                            concurs suggest New Delhi and Ottawa be asked make prompt approaches to

                            more in terms of informing those governments what we propose to do
                            rather than asking for their concurrence. Meanwhile we would compile

                            respect to VietNam.<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2">Dated November 20, not
                                printed.</note> This memorandum is designed to supplement that
                            status report by providing additional clarifying information, covering
                            subjects not covered in the report and bringing it up to date where
                            additional information has been received.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Military Situation</hi>. There has been continuing
                            deterioration, but no major change, in the military situation. The
                            crisis described in the Taylor Mission Report has not been reversed.
                            There has been a recent step-up of Viet Cong activity in the Delta and
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> analysis suggests that the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> plans to broaden the area of
                                <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss> north of Saigon. Though the
                            Government has taken some military initiatives, its military operations
                            have produced no significant results. There is one bit of evidence
                            indicating that the Cambodians may have tightened their border somewhat
                            and that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> are raiding Cambodian
                            border villages in retaliation.</p>
                        <p>Casualty rates remain at the higher level inaugurated in September, when
                            the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> stepped up their offensive.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Flood Situation</hi>. Each new report on the flood
                            emphasizes the fact that its effects will not be so severe as had been
                            feared initially. However, estimates of rice requirements which have
                            fluctuated up and down have now been firmly estimated at the relatively
                            high figure of 220,000 tons. Action to deal with this problem is
                            reported in the status report. Meanwhile, Diem has established his own

                            requested that this level be increased to $160 million on the basis of
                            new requirements created by the flood, particularly the need for

                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> November 20 on several
                            matters, and in course conversation asked him what he could tell me re
                            schedule of follow-up discussions with President Diem on recent
                            démarche. This led to long, wide-ranging, and pessimistic account by
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> of how things stand
                            here. I do not take his pessimism too seriously-indeed it may be only
                            bargaining tactic-and conversation gave me opportunity to clarify and
                            put in proportion proposed “new partnership” envisaged in our position,
                            and reasons for it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that Diem had not yet
                            discussed fully with him U.S. proposals presented last Friday;<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">November 17.</note> but had given him
                            impression of being “very sad and very disappointed”. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said Diem had said he now
                            hesitates to put proposals before even his Cabinet Ministers, fearing
                            that they would be disappointed and lose heart. He had intended to
                            discuss US proposals with both Cabinet and selected members of Assembly
                            who had been consulted re advisability of US forces at time of Taylor
                            Mission, but now thought contrast between his earlier question and US
                            proposals too striking. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            conveyed impression that Diem is brooding <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0672"/>over US proposals and has made no move yet to develop
                            specific ideas on actions <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> expected
                            to take. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said President’s
                            attitude seemed to be that US asking great concessions of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in realm its sovereignty, in exchange
                            for little additional help; that this is great disappointment after
                            discussions with General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            involving, in particular, concept of Delta Task Force; that Diem seemed
                            to wonder whether US was getting ready to back out on Viet-Nam as, he
                            suggested, we had done in Laos.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> that if in fact
                            President Diem had reacted in this manner after consideration our
                            proposals, I wished to talk with him directly and soon. These are very
                            serious matters to us as well as to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>,
                            and we cannot afford to have any misunderstandings, lack of clarity, or
                            to deal at arms’ length. What I had proposed on President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>’s instructions was a serious,
                            difficult, and far-reaching set of proposals designed to reverse the
                            trend and eventually to win the struggle in VietNam. I said I was sure
                            he knew this, and he confirmed it. I told him that we on our side had to
                            have a structure for improved performance on the part of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in several areas, in order to make
                            far-reaching political decision involving substantial additional US
                            effort, manpower, resources, and prestige. Furthermore, the United
                            States had no idea whatsoever of wanting to make South Viet-Nam a US
                            “protectorate” (Diem’s word); on contrary, if <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> could protect itself, nothing would please us more. The
                            fact is that we are trying in a most difficult situation to develop
                            means to help <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> protect itself, and
                            measures we propose are very far-reaching indeed. I explained reasons
                            why we considered introduction US combat forces, either in
                            anti-guerrilla war or as garrison troops, unwise; and how we had
                            searched for, and found, substantial measures to bolster <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s own effort in anti-subversion war,
                            which would be effective if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            reorganized itself to make them so. I also emphasized the seriousness of
                            our proposal to bring international pressure, and effective pressure, on
                            Communist bloc to discontinue infiltrations. I elaborated on benefits to
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> from multi-national
                            participation in civilian effort re rehabilitation flooded
                            provinces.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> seemed to be torn between
                            appreciation of soundness and significance of our proposals and the
                            difficulties, political, psychological and administrative, which Diem
                            faces. He said frankly that given the structure of Vietnamese society,
                            the paucity of people willing to assume responsibility, the tendency to
                            analyze and criticize rather than to act, he shared President’s fear
                            that public acceptance of our proposals would disastrously weaken strong
                            Diem leadership which he considers indispensable at this time. “Without
                            his determined and active leadership, we would collapse.” On other hand,
                            he recognized our needs in terms US and world opinion. He inquired most
                            earnestly whether our proposals could not be done “in <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0673"/>a practical manner”, meaning
                            step-by-step, without publicity, and without requiring any over-all
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> acceptance. He pointed to
                            present reorganization and strengthening <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> intelligence service as a case in point. He said Diem
                            would do these things one by one on a practical basis if right men could
                            be found, but he would not accept anything that looked to public as a
                            sweeping reorganization under US pressure. I told him that essentially
                            it is results, not appearances, that we are seeking; that if <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would come up with specific suggestions
                            for improvements we would try to meet them on the means; but that our
                            experience to date had led us to conclusion that real measures of
                            decentralization and delegation of authority, strengthening of personnel
                            in administrative positions, and broadening popular appeal are urgently
                            required.</p>
                        <p>Turning to military, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> asked
                            what sort of “new terms of reference” for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> are envisaged. I said that as minimum Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> would have to have command authority
                            for any US operational forces introduced, in addition to present
                            advisory authority as maximum, and depending on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> needs and wishes, he might have a role like that
                            General Van Fleet in Greece. I described how Greece, nearly submerged by
                            Communism, had been able to reserve the trend and win, making full use
                            of US operational advice as well as material aid; and that Greece is now
                            a fully independent member of world community. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that in military command
                            structure, as in so many others, there is grave lack of competent people
                            willing to discharge responsibility. I said we could help in this. He
                            said he knew we could, but trouble was that none of their people,
                            especially military, liked to have their incompetence exposed. I asked
                            him whether he was telling me that introduction of US advisors for
                            operations would bring about such resentment on part <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> officer corps as to cause military
                            coup d’etat. He said that was what he had in mind. I said I thought we
                            could find a way; it would depend on how the matter was handled and the
                            quality of the men we might contribute. I again urged <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> to urge President Diem to come up
                            with specific proposals. I said we are not inflexible, but determined
                            this time to work out a new partnership which would give real results
                            and win the struggle, now going badly. We do not wish to take over, but
                            we had to be assured that additional US commitments, plus present
                            large-scale aid, was going to have real results. Otherwise, I saw no way
                            of winning.</p>
                        <p>I think my best tactic is to wait a few days for Diem’s response, I do
                            not want to seem to be pressing him to buy our proposals, and I think
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> will help.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I would appreciate prompt as possible clarification and

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff examined three possible command
                                structures for South Vietnam; i.e., a unified command under the
                                Joint Chiefs of Staff, a joint task force under the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff, and a subordinate unified command under <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. Subject to establishment
                                of the agreement and objectives cited in paragraph 2, the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff recommend a subordinate unified command under <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> at this time for the
                                following reasons: Current guidance as to the nature of the mission
                                and the magnitude of US forces to be assigned to the new command
                                does not warrant the establishment of a theater of operations type
                                command directly under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. South Viet-Nam
                                cannot be isolated militarily from the rest of Southeast Asia which
                                is in <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s area of

                                contingency plans for South Viet-Nam are inextricably tied, both

                                Galbraith</persName>’s letter on VietNam.<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">See <ref target="#d267">Document

                        <p>On his major point I have no objection; namely, that if Diem does not
                            perform we be prepared to indicate in the proper way to the proper
                            people that we would prefer a successor. The management of that crisis
                            will take great skill to avoid exploitation by the Communists; but I
                            think it not impossible. Contingency planning might quietly begin.</p>
                        <p>The letter does not grip the problem of infiltration. In 1959 there were
                            2,000 guerrillas; by a pre-announced and purposeful policy they have
                            been built up to 16,000 (aside from the Communist civil guards) while
                            taking heavy casualties. We know from one transit station, on one route
                            that the infiltration rate was over 400 per month for over six months
                            early in 1961. Virtually the whole of the threat in the plateau is the
                            consequence of recent infiltration; and the build up of the cadres in
                            the south in the last year has been an infiltration job. The proportions
                            have been as we described in our report: about 70% locally recruited;
                            25% South Vietnamese trained in the north and re-infiltrated; 5% North
                            Vietnamese regulars. But the opening of the second front on the plateau
                            via Laos has probably increased the proportion of infiltrators. The
                            infiltrators have all been trained political cadres and soldiers, the
                            hard core of the Viet Cong effort.</p>
                        <p>The proportion of guerrillas to regular troops in the war in South
                            Viet-Nam is not abnormal by the experience of previous guerrilla wars.
                            Moreover, none of the recent guerrilla wars has been won with an open
                            frontier; the Greek war was won when the Stalin-Tito fight closed the
                            Yugoslav frontier and fractured the Greek <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0684"/>Communist Party; there was no Communist frontier in
                            Malaya or in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>In short, I cannot help conclude that in order to heighten his political
                            argument Ken has grossly underestimated the military significance of the
                            infiltration process; he has ignored Diem’s record down to 1959; and he
                            has misinterpreted the brutal basic arithmetic of guerrilla war. (I
                            should like to remind Ken that <persName corresp="#p_DMJ1">Desai</persName> told Alex J. and me that there is an Indian
                            province on the Burma frontier where they require 35,000 policemen to
                            control 2,500 guerrillas.)<note n="3" xml:id="d274fn3">This conversation
                                has not been further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>As for Diem. While by the normal standards of an underdeveloped area, his
                            weaknesses would be tolerable-and he did well down to 1959-he has four
                            major weaknesses in terms of the crisis he confronts. First, he cannot
                            protect his peasants. Second, the intellectuals are affronted by his
                            dictatorial political style. Third, the army, the civil servants, and
                            even his ministers are frustrated by his administrative style. Fourth,
                            he lacks the ability to communicate and to identify with the mass of the
                            people-a gift which even Sarit and Sihanouk command. Right now the
                            critical problem from our point of view is his administrative weakness.
                            If this can be conquered by a combination of U.S. partnership and
                            pressure, we shall get a lift of confidence which would, among other
                            things, make it more safe to help induce a coup. If he will not perform,
                            I think it proper that we conceive of an alternative.</p>
                        <p>With respect to American troops, I know of no one who has recommended
                            that American troops take part in sweeps through Vietnamese territory.
                            There are, nevertheless, concrete functions for U.S. forces which might
                            be envisaged if the battle goes badly or if we feel, for other reasons,
                            American troops are necessary: to provide a plate-glass presence at the
                            17th parallel and to relieve Vietnamese forces for combat; to take over
                            the protection of towns in the open country (either in the plateau or
                            along the coast), and to relieve Vietnamese troops for combat; to
                            provide assistance in road building and in other engineering and
                            logistic tasks; to help cope with the Viet Cong if they move from their
                            present hit-and-run tactics to open and sustained battle.</p>
                        <p>The Viet-Nam situation confronts us with the question of whether we shall
                            or shall not accept the mounting of a guerrilla war across a frontier as
                            legitimate. I wish it were not so; but the New Frontier will be measured
                            in history in part on how that challenge was met. No amount of political
                            jiu-jitsu is going to get us off that hook; but-certainly-our stance in
                            dealing with that issue will be <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0685"/>affected significantly by the administrative and political

                            morning with Vu Van Thai critical of Diem, will complicate your
                            negotiations. If you feel it necessary, you can assure Diem that no one
                            in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> inspired these stories and we
                            regret their appearance. We certainly have no desire to humiliate Diem.
                            Hope you will be able impress on Diem that we are simply seeking to
                            arrive at broad understanding with him which will permit establishment
                            of effective partnership between us. As you well stated to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, we are interested in substance
                            rather than form and hope Diem will be able quickly to get down to

                        <p>704. I learned yesterday of the establishment in Saigon of 2nd ADVON. As
                            explained to me by its commander, Brigadier General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName><gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, this headquarters will have operational control over
                            all <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> operational (i.e.,
                            non-training) units in Vietnam, including Jungle Jim, AC&amp;W unit,
                            planes due to arrive for spraying operations, etc. It will also have
                            operational control over certain <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            units in Thailand. It is my further understanding that, while General
                                <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> will concurrently be
                            head of Air Force section of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, as
                            Commander 2nd ADVON he will have separate staff and will report directly
                            to 13 Air Force and thence through <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>.
                            Finally, General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> tells
                            me that he expects 2nd ADVON has begun operations with skeleton staff
                            established at <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s Tan-Son-Nhu Air
                            Base.</p>
                        <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0688"/>
                        <p>I have high regard for General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> and in what follows I am not expressing a view
                            regarding military command relationships, and specifically not objecting
                            to establishing this headquarters.</p>
                        <p>I nevertheless find it incomprehensible that new US military headquarters
                            would be established in this country without consultation with me or
                            with Government of Vietnam. As new headquarters will immediately become
                            known to Vietnamese Government and probably very quickly to press, I
                            have asked General <persName corresp="#p_ABGRH1">Anthis</persName> not
                            to expand activation 2nd ADVON in Viet-Nam until following has been

                            of Vietnamese newspaper article reported reftel, and subsequent article
                            along same line in this morning’s issue of same paper (Thoi Bao). I told
                            him that I had not come to push him on response to our proposals of
                            November 17, although I hoped he would soon be in position to give me
                            his views. I wished specifically to bring to his <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0689"/>attention two articles appearing in one
                            Vietnamese newspaper which were untrue in their implication and
                            obviously damaging to our joint enterprise. Our one hour’s conversation
                            was inconclusive, but rather revealing.</p>
                        <p>Diem said he had just read the articles in question. They did reflect, in
                            his opinion, the latent feelings of most Vietnamese (and, he added most
                            Asians) concerning fancied or real conditions attached to Western aid.
                            He went on to say that, because of this fact, he had not told anyone
                            except <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName> and Vu Van Mau the content
                            of our proposals of last week. He said he feared the reaction even among
                            his own Cabinet members. I said I thought he misjudged their sentiments.
                            Diem went on to say that newspaper articles in question were not
                            inspired by government and could not have been based on knowledge of US
                            proposals (except that obtained from US press), but that they expressed
                            a point of view which he felt would be widespread if our proposals were
                            known. He speculated that articles in part reaction to US press
                            (mentioned in particular Rose’s story in Time and Elegant’s story in
                            Newsweek), which he said indicated that US would have to “take charge”
                            if Viet-Nam were to be saved. He mentioned in this connection, and read
                            from, an article in Hong Kong Observer of November 8. I said I would not
                            argue the point of whether or not Vietnamese articles in question were
                            [garble], but that I wished to point out frankly that line taken in them
                            had certain clear resemblances to what I had understood to be Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>’s views
                            expressed in recent conversation with correspondent of Christian Science
                            Monitor. Beyond that, I wanted to make point that our difficult and
                            complex problem of establishing a more effective joint partnership to
                            win the war here could only be complicated, and perhaps be made
                            impossible, by a continuation of emotional, incorrect, and damaging line
                            in newspapers. Diem concurred in this, but insisted that
                            misrepresentations of his government in our own press could not but
                            provoke nationalistic rejoinders from newspapers in Vietnam. He did not
                            offer, nor did I press him, to issue any countervailing release; but I
                            believe our conversation may help dampen down this foolish and dangerous
                            business.</p>
                        <p>Throughout this discussion, Diem continued to make references to the quid
                            pro quo aspects of our proposals, claiming that they played right into
                            the hands of the Communists. He argued that we are pressing him to give
                            a monopoly on nationalism to the Communists. I told him that this was
                            the exact opposite of our aim; that we were not seeking quid pro quo as
                            such, but were definitely seeking a structure of government in Vietnam,
                            under his leadership, which could bear the weight of increased US
                            assistance and could channel that assistance effectively; and that we
                            were definitely seeking a basis in US and world opinion to enable US to
                            support his government <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0690"/>even
                            more heavily. He promised next week to sit down and systematically go
                            over our proposals point by point and to give his considered reaction. I
                            said it would be helpful if he could give his response in due course in
                            written form for clarity and precision. Throughout, Diem stressed that
                            any attempt to “broaden the government” and to “make it more popular”
                            was putting the cart before the horse. Giving security to the people, he
                            said, is the first essential of regaining popular support; it is
                            Communist terror and propaganda which is destroying Vietnamese support
                            of their government; the will exists but can only be demonstrated when
                            the people are free to express it; no additions of “dissidents” to his
                            government would alter this fact. Moreover, he had many independents in
                            the government already, and had had for many years. He cited educators,
                            doctors, and others in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Without prejudging outcome these negotiations, [I?] think we should be
                            [doing?] some [garble] thinking whether we should not put major stress
                            on efficiency in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> rather than on more
                            nebulous concept of “political reform”. [I?] think we can get a certain
                            measure of improvement in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            efficiency, which may open up possibility of political liberalization
                            and broadening of political base, with all deliberate speed.</p>

                        <p>At the same time it seems to me that we cannot fail to take immediate
                            action needed to lay a foundation for the prospective program of
                            expanded assistance to VietNam. The contemplated publication of the
                            “Jorden Report” exposing and documenting the North Vietnamese part in
                            the Viet Cong guerrilla war is an essential prelude to the program.</p>
                        <p>I believe you will concur that the forthcoming publication is factual,
                            objective and probably understated.</p>

                            certain points raised by <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>,
                            who spoke under instructions.</p>
                        <p>Following principal points emerged from <persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName>’s somewhat opaque presentation:</p>
                        <p>US should not rely on neutrals, particularly <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and RLG. Greatest threat to free world is in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, not Berlin. Last year Communists waged
                            war without danger to themselves to take over Laos. This year it is
                            VietNam. American military assistance is best direct counter to
                            Communists. It should not be spread too thin; should be used not only as
                            foreign aid, but as arm in a war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary replied we not satisfied with attitude neutrals, but noted we
                            have explained situation to Indians and others. They increasingly
                            concerned. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> may be helpful through
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and by its diplomatic efforts,
                            but we should not expect too much. Our total per <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0692"/>capita aid to India for 12-year period
                            has been $2.00. Our total per capita aid to Viet-Nam for six years has
                            been $100.</p>
                        <p>Secretary agreed on dangers in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and
                            emphasized necessity joint effort. He asked repeatedly, “How do we win
                            the battle?” Ambassador did not reply directly, but several times in his
                            presentation made point US should be tougher with friends and foes
                            alike.</p>
                        <p>Secretary asked to what extent Thoi Bao editorial represented public
                            expression of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s real attitude; said
                            it appeared to be most unhelpful prelude to Diem-<persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> talks. Emphasized US had no
                            desire “run” <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. Our only aim to help
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with its own war.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TVC1">Chuong</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> concerned lest impression be gained
                            there was to be “condominium” in VietNam, but, speaking personally, did
                            not believe editorial represented <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            opinion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said editorial (picked up in Washington Post today) could
                            create serious public opinion problem in US. Emphasized that in Greece
                            and Korea when the question was that of winning battle, problem of
                            sovereignty did not arise.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador asked if US had suggested specific steps which might have
                            caused editorial and mentioned Diem sensitive on question bringing
                            exiled political elements into <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.
                            Secretary replied that we had simply asked for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> views on how it could get broader support; perhaps
                            there were elements in VietNam, now on sidelines, who might throw
                            themselves behind <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in its
                            struggle.</p>

                            to you of November 16 on this subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d283fn2"><ref target="#d261">Document 261</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>There is one consideration bearing on the introduction of substantial US
                            combat forces into Viet-Nam which is not mentioned in that memorandum
                            and which seems to me worth noting.</p>
                        <p>Domestic US dissatisfaction with what would surely be the prolonged
                            involvement of American soldiers in these indecisive anti-guerrilla
                            operations would mount and give rise to growing demands that we attack
                            the source of the aggression in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>If we resisted these pressures, they would build up and eventually spill
                            over into across-the-board criticism of our foreign policy, which would
                            make it increasingly difficult to conduct that policy with moderation
                            and good sense. We would be back in the atmosphere of Korea 1950-53-only
                            more so.</p>
                        <p>If we gave in to these pressures and attacked North Vietnam, we would be
                            propelled into a widening conflict which might be hard to terminate
                            short of all-out struggle with Peiping.</p>
                        <p>In short, once we committed combat troops to Viet-Nam we would tend to
                            lose control of subsequent events-either in that theater or more
                            generally-by reason of the popular reactions that our continued
                            involvement would likely trigger.</p>

                                either the Berlin or the Korean model proclaims a significant change
                                in the U.S. attitude which should be confirmed by the program which
                                we adopt for South Vietnam. As long as that program is essentially
                                an intensification of past actions, it would be at a minimum
                                inconsistent to set up a command structure such as the Berlin or
                                Korean model which suggests that we are clearing the boards for a

                                    misinterpretation of intentions of our proposals with respect

                                    full discussion between you and Diem on concrete measures to

                            </list></p>
                        <p>With respect first point, it occurs to us that Diem may have taken point
                            one (i) “administrators and advisors” together with para 5 of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 619<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">See <ref target="#d257fn2">footnote 2, Document 257</ref>.</note>
                            as indicating intention on part <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> take
                            over much greater degree of control than in fact our intent. While we
                            satisfied you will be able clarify this when you have opportunity for
                            full discussion with Diem, following amplification our thinking may be
                            of some assistance to you. First, point one (i) specifically provides
                            such action only in agreement between two governments and was included
                            to meet Diem’s request to <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> for assistance in
                            meeting shortage trained administrators. We certainly have no intention
                            of packing his administration with Americans against his will or “taking
                            over his government”.</p>
                        <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0699"/>
                        <p>With respect to last sentence para 5 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 619 on “decision-making processes” what we have in
                            mind is that, in operations directly related to the security situation,
                            partnership will be so close that one party will not take decisions or
                            actions affecting the other without full and frank prior consultation.
                            This was spirit in which proposition in para 5 put forward. We think it
                            probably fruitless to argue or engage in recrimination over generalities
                            and that important point is to discuss specifics, drawing from Diem if
                            possible his own suggestions and, to extent necessary, building on that
                            base.</p>
                        <p>With respect second point, pares 2 a, b, and c and para 5 of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 619 are considered here only as
                            broad guides on which we rely on you and Country Team to translate in
                            your negotiations into such specific measures as you consider effective
                            and practical. Seen from here, crucial elements appear to be: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>Follow through on intelligence reform and collaboration</item>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>In addition we believe it essential for Diem to make moves which would,
                            especially for international and American public opinion, symbolize the
                            fact that bulk of VietNamese people-not merely “Diem people”-desire to
                            maintain their independence. How this can best be done is not possible
                            to specify in detail from here but it difficult to overemphasize its
                            importance from Diem’s point of view as well as our own. However, might
                            it not be possible for Diem to put a friendly labor leader into some
                            government position, release some political prisoners on selective
                            basis, or to form or give increased substance to public consultative
                            bodies?</p>
                        <p>We would hope you would be able arrange with Diem for full day or even
                            two at some secluded spot for really full discussion. Diem’s
                            dilatoriness in entering into such discussion is giving impression here
                            of lack of sense of urgency on his part.</p>
                        <p>If your discussion with Diem is clearly not satisfactory it is desired
                            that you promptly return to Washington for full consultation with
                            respect our future course. You authorized in your discretion so inform
                            Diem.</p>

                        <p>Political uncertainty of Diem’s position and doubts as to his willingness
                            to take steps to make his government more effective must not prevent us
                            from going ahead full blast (without publicity, <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0702"/>until political discussions are
                            completed) on all possible actions short of large scale introduction of
                            US combat forces. Timing of putting these actions visibly into effect in
                            Viet-Nam will be affected by political development, but we cannot let
                            this slow down our making all necessary preparations and movements. This
                            is philosophy behind series of decisions reached by me yesterday with
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and being communicated to you

                        <p>Fundamentally, we must adjust ourselves to a perennially unclear
                            political framework and to a policy that for overall national reasons
                            sets limits on military action. However, that policy already gives us
                            considerable scope, and I will do my utmost to get authority for any new
                            ideas you may suggest which are not now covered. What we must do is
                            wring the last ounce out of present possibilities and I feel that we
                            have sometimes been slow, both here at <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and in the field, in devising and carrying out feasible
                            actions. Cost considerations particularly should be secondary in your

                        <p>Two reliable reports indicate that top south Vietnamese military leaders
                            may be plotting a coup against President Diem. These are the first
                            reports of coup plotting since the flurry of reports last month just
                            prior to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>’s
                            visit to Saigon. Last month’s <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0704"/>reports, however, were rather vague, of doubtful reliability, and
                            failed to cite names of individuals involved.</p>
                        <p>Generals Critical. On November 24, Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh, Commanding
                            General of the Army Field Command, was unprecedentedly critical of the
                            Diem government in his comments to the US Army Attaché. He referred to
                            Diem’s reorganizational moves within the military establishment as being
                            highly inadequate and nothing more than “shams” to fool the Americans
                            and evidenced acute concern over interference by Diem and his family in
                            military operations. Gen. Minh stated that the situation was extremely
                            grave, that the next few months could well be decisive, and urged the US
                            to take a firm stand with Diem. Brig. Gen. Le Van Kim, a deputy under
                            Minh and long outspoken in his criticism of Diem’s leadership, was
                            present and obviously agreed with Minh’s comments.</p>
                        <p>The following day, Col. Pham Van Dong, Deputy Commander of the 3rd Army
                            Corps, informed the US Army Attaché that he had discussed “coup
                            possibilities” with Brig. Gen. Le Van Nghiem, Commander of the 3rd Army
                            Corps, and the latter replied that “we will wait and see how things go
                            before we take sides.” Dong also told our Attaché that “something must
                            and will be done very soon, possibly by December 1.”</p>
                        <p>Growing Disgust With the Nhus. The activities and influence of <persName corresp="#p_NDN1">Ngo Dinh Nhu</persName>, Diem’s brother and
                            political adviser, and of Madam <persName corresp="#p_NDN2">Nhu</persName> continue to be major issues raised by Diem’s
                            critics. Gen. Minh, for example, stated that he considers Diem to be a
                            puppet of Nhu, while Col. Dong said that Nhu has his own plans for
                            taking control of the government. Most of Diem critics in government and
                            even some of his supporters, moreover, blame Nhu for the anti-US press
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>Heightened Sense of Urgency Within Government. Since last month military
                            and civilian leaders have urgently voiced to Americans their views that
                            Diem must move quickly to reorganize the government, delegate
                            responsibility, and utilize more effectively the existing resources for
                            fighting the Communists. This urgency coincided with the Taylor mission,
                            and a number of officials even recommended that the US pressure Diem to
                            take the necessary steps. A number of Vietnamese abroad, including Vu
                            Van Thai, formerly Director General of the Budget and Foreign Aid, also
                            have been sharply critical of Diem and have urged a firm US position.
                            The recent anti-US statements by the Saigon press may have convinced
                            Diem’s critics that Diem will not accept US recommendations and that
                            they should therefore act on their own to alter the situation.</p>

                            officials may have also concluded that the Saigon press attacks have
                            weakened US support of Diem, and their comments to the Army <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0705"/>Attache may be designed to elicit such
                            information. Their estimate of US intentions could strongly influence a
                            decision to undertake a coup.</p>

                            possible. Some of these are covered in the discussion below</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative</hi> I: If this occurs, our problems will
                            by no means be solved. It is quite possible that we will get a formal
                            agreement from Diem which he will then fail to carry out. Indeed, he may
                            offer us such formal assurances for the precise purpose of heading off a
                            coup and giving him time to organize to prevent such a coup. This time
                            we cannot give Diem nearly as much time to perform as we have given him
                            in the past. If it is evident within the following month or six weeks
                            that he is not going to perform we will have to consider whether we
                            should make an effort to have him replaced. If it becomes evident that
                            he is buying time in order to build his defenses against a coup, we will
                            have to move even more quickly.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative II-A:</hi> If this occurs it will probably
                            be because of one or a combination of three circumstances: (a) the
                            military lacks the will and determination to mount a coup; (b) the U.S.
                            fails to give a clear signal that it will support a coup group; or (c)
                            Diem manages to find sufficient forces loyal to him to prevent coup
                            plans from succeeding. This kind of a situation could be most difficult
                            of all. We would be in a stand-off in our relations. The worst variant
                            (though perhaps an unlikely one) would be one where we had become
                            identified with a coup attempt that had failed. Our relations with Diem
                            would then be at almost dead end. Under other variants, not including
                            U.S. identification with an unsuccessful coup effort, we would have to
                            consider such possibilities as simply withdrawing our offer of
                            additional aid and attempting to revert to the status quo ante or
                            attempting to develop a different kind of package which we would attempt
                            to sell to Diem.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative II-B:</hi> This would be the best of the
                            alternative coup possibilities. What should be the U.S. role in bringing
                            about such a state of affairs? The evidence suggests that all we will
                            probably have to do to ensure that a coup takes place is to indicate
                            clearly, but in an indirect fashion, that we will support a coup effort.
                            In giving such indication, we might be well advised to indicate that we
                            would much prefer an arrangement which provided for the constitutional
                            succession of Vice President Tho.</p>
                        <p>What we do need to do positively in such a situation is to avoid the
                            possibility that either alternative situation II-C or II-D would occur.
                            Our control over troop dispositions which might bring Can Lao-officered
                            units into Saigon to prevent a coup would be very limited. However, we
                            should be able to do something about insuring <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0707"/>that Vice President
                                <persName>Tho</persName> is protected against assassination. Nhu
                            would probably make him the first target of any move since he is the
                            obvious successor. Nhu has already done his utmost to downgrade him.</p>
                        <p>Another possible danger that must be guarded against is that the
                            Communists will exploit the situation to create confusion. We ought to
                            have prepared now a very full appreciation of just how much trouble the
                            Communists could create. My own belief is that they would not be able to
                            move in and take over militarily. I also believe that it is highly
                            doubtful that they have the capability to insinuate any of their
                            followers into high positions in a coup party. They might exploit a
                            situation of uncertainty (alternative II-D) to produce a period of chaos
                            which would result in an early Communist takeover.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the above, the U.S. may have relatively little direct
                            role to play. Our most important action will be to make clear that we
                            will go along with a coup.</p>
                        <p>If this analysis is correct, we would not be well advised to pull our
                            ambassador out and put Lansdale in Saigon if Diem refuses to sign on the
                            dotted line. If we can get the kind of coup we want without evidence of
                            overt U.S. involvement, we shall be better off than if we are clearly
                            identified with a coup group. No matter how unpopular Diem may be and no
                            matter how popular his successors, our identification with the change
                            would be a definite drawback in Viet Nam and in the world at large. No
                            government in a situation like that in Viet Nam is going to remain
                            tremendously popular for very long. Moreover, in the larger arena of our
                            relations with the rest of the world such identification could convert
                            the situation in Viet Nam into one like that in Laos making it appear to
                            be a straight U.S.-Bloc struggle for power with the Vietnamese as mere
                            pawns. Our identification with the change may be an immediate bonus, but
                            a long-term disadvantage. It would also involve a heavy additional
                            commitment of U.S. prestige which may or may not be advantageous. If we
                            send Lansdale when <persName>Nolting</persName> leaves, the coup will
                            inevitably be viewed as another <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            effort since he is so clearly identifiable in the area.</p>
                        <p><persName>Nolting</persName> himself should stay in Viet Nam long enough
                            to “pass the word”. It is most important that it be passed in a way that
                            gives it an authoritative coloration.</p>
                        <p>I am not altogether convinced that <persName>Nolting</persName> needs to
                            leave in order to dramatize the breakdown in our relations and the need
                            for change. The situation will be known quickly enough within the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> without such action. There would be a
                            real advantage in having him there to direct our responses in the event
                            a coup occurs. Unfortunately the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> is
                            so new to that part of the world that he <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0708"/>would be in great difficulty. If we want to indicate
                            our displeasure we should be able to find other ways to communicate it.
                            Nolting’s absence could conceivably deter a coup by the military. To sum
                            up, I believe that, even if we go through with plans to withdraw
                            Nolting, such withdrawal might better be deferred for a time to permit
                            him to have some influence on developments that occur subsequent to his
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Because of the disadvantages of U.S. identification, any military moves
                            should be relatively unostentatious. We might, at some crucial stage,
                            let coup leaders know privately that we were prepared to fly in forces,
                            without putting such forces in a publicly visible position off the
                            coast.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative II-C:</hi> This alternative would create a
                            worse situation than we have now. Nhu is much less popular than Diem. He
                            would probably run a very repressive regime and would probably be most
                            difficult to deal with. Moreover, if he were in control, the political
                            situation might become even more unstable. There would probably be
                            extensive purges and counter-coup plotting. The likelihood of a coup by
                            Nhu succeeding is probably fairly low because he is so universally
                            disliked. However, the potential role of the Can Lao is difficult to
                            assess. What is more likely is a temporary Nhu success followed by a
                            counter-coup by the experienced military officers. Such a development
                            could produce the situation envisaged in Alternative Il-D.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Alternative II-D:</hi> A struggle for power could
                            involve any or all of five elements-Diem, the regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> officers, Nhu and the Can Lao, the
                            Communists and the sects (which might be armed by any of the other
                            three). Such a struggle could create a situation most favorable to the
                            Communists. If we should support a coup effort by the officers, it would
                            be most important to assure that it succeeded quickly and cleanly. One
                            of the first objectives would therefore have to be the effective
                            neutralization of Nhu. He would be the most immediate threat.</p>

                            kept in the Philippines or some considerable distance offshore and flown
                            into Saigon?</p>

                        <p>Upon return here, the boss had another crash project for me to work
                                on,<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">Lansdale was asked by Attorney

                            so I’ve been quite apart from most of the follow-through of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> group’s reports and
                            activities. I’ve had to keep one eye cocked on it, but it hasn’t been
                            enough-as perhaps you’ve seen in the press.</p>
                        <p>One of the conclusions drawn in town, and both <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> &amp;<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> say it isn’t one of theirs
                            (although I’m suspicious) is that we cannot help the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> win against the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> as long as a dictator (Diem) holds power. So, one of the
                            thoughts being ginned up is that I go over as his personal advisor and,
                            presumably, clobber him from up close. I pointed out that this was a
                            duty without honor and I’d be dammed if I’d do that.<note n="4" xml:id="d293fn4">In a memorandum to the President of November 23,

                            conversation continued, “We did have in mind bringing

                            we get too wrong a response. T is concerned it would be viewed as his
                            being a second amb. The Sec thinks that can be explained. T mentioned
                            getting L from the AG for this and the Sec said it would not be for too

                        <p>Between midday November 27 and 30, a decision was made not to send

                        <p>I do hope there is some sound way of getting you into the act on VN,
                            because the situation there needs the best we have.</p>
                        <p>Diem has been getting worn out by all the vicious attacks on him. The
                            first evening I was there, he looked really down in the dumps-so I told
                            him to go to bed instead of talking to me. During the next several days,
                            I went to work to keep him up, and he started becoming the fighter we
                            knew of yore. However, these latest attacks on him-seemingly stemming
                            from the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> group-apparently
                            really got him down. Also, the wording of some of the U.S. proposals
                            made it look as though the U.S. was going to act the same way the French
                            have. I jumped back into the act long enough last night to try to
                            straighten out this aspect.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> war is getting real rough. Your
                            successor seems to be fighting it with memos, with the result that he
                            has lost much of his influence with Diem, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, etc. I urged <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> to work with him more closely and <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> pointed to a big stack of papers
                            and said: that’s what I got the last time I asked for some help.</p>
                        <p>A number of our <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> army friends have told
                            me that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> is a jerk and no
                            good. He and Diem have said much the same about some of their generals.
                            I tried to explain to all that they had to work together in a team and
                            that suffering casualties always creates emotional stress-which is the
                            real basis for any falling out in a situation like theirs.</p>

                        <p>I’m afraid that another coup might get ginned up, despite present U.S.
                            attitudes locally against it. If so, it could lead to real disaster.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, Diem, <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, and the
                            others think highly of Fritz Nolting. Too bad you didn’t have someone
                            like him as ambassador while you were there.</p>
                        <p>We probably will be boosting our help by a lot more men, money, &amp;
                            material. However, what’s really lacking is something of the spirit,
                            something of leadership qualities on our part, which would give meaning
                            to our aid. It’s pure hell to be on the sidelines and seeing so
                            conventional and unimaginative an approach being tried. About all I can
                            do is continue putting in my two-bits worth every chance I get to add a
                            bit of spark to the concepts. I’m afraid that these aren’t always
                            welcome.</p>
                        <p>Rather than end this on a gloomy downbeat, let’s noodle out how to lick
                            the crowd. One of the main problems is here at home, with Washington
                            being only one phase. Do you feel up to entering the fray again—against
                            folks of <persName corresp="#p_DE1">Durbrow</persName>’s ilk—but much
                            subtler? I’ll see what I can noodle out for a sound place and way to do
                            battle, if you feel up to it.</p>

                                    <persName>Tho</persName> that Vietnamese criticisms of such
                                statements were fair if addressed <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0712"/>to the authors of the statements but not at a
                                friendly government. He stated that this was a matter of simple
                                justice and should not be interpreted as a decision by the
                                Vietnamese Government not to insult the American Government for
                                political reasons. He then added that it is most important that
                                neither the Americans nor the Government of Viet-Nam (GV) be
                                isolated by Communist propaganda whose primary objective is to
                                isolate the Vietnamese Government from its people and the Americans
                                from their companions in the Free World. …</item>

                            <item>Nhu stated that the difficulties between Vietnamese and Americans
                                can be laid at the door of the Free World’s lack of any coherent
                                concept of the development of an underdeveloped country toward
                                democracy. He contrasted this with the definite stages by which the
                                Communists view their political program. The Communists view an
                                independent country as moving along a clear path to include the
                                following four states: (a) neutrality, (b) anti Free World, (c) pro
                                Soviet bloc, (d) popular democracy. It is this concept of stages
                                which enables the Communist world to accept with no criticism,
                                conditions or other harassment a country such as Cambodia in the
                                neutral stage, the efforts to create a neutral Laos, and the
                                situation of other underdeveloped countries in Africa and Asia.
                                While the Free World looks toward Laotian neutrality, for instance,
                                as an objective, the Communists are content to consider it as one
                                step toward the eventual goal. This concept of progression toward
                                Communist control also explains the discipline of a Communist party
                                in a country such as Cambodia when instructed to support the
                                government in power.</item>

                            <item>In contrast, the Free World has only one step it expects any
                                underdeveloped country to make. It expects it to move from the stage
                                of underdevelopment to full-blooming democracy in one jump. The
                                impossibility of such an abrupt change, the chaos which ensues when
                                it is attempted and lack of understanding of this fact between the
                                country itself and outside observers all lead to considerable lack
                                of confidence and criticism between the Free World and the
                                underdeveloped country. The greatest need in the Free World today is
                                a clear concept of stages through which underdeveloped countries are
                                expected to progress so that premature expectations of democracy
                                will not destroy confidence between free nations. While this problem
                                applies to Vietnam, it applies with equal force to other
                                underdeveloped countries in Africa and Asia.</item>

                            <item>Nhu stated that one of the first requirements of this progression
                                is a step toward land reform and land resettlement, to give each
                                citizen a plot of land of his own and a feeling of economic
                                security. At the same time, like the tribes of Israel moving through
                                the desert toward the promised land, the flame of future ideal, the
                                Ark of the <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0713"/>Covenant, must
                                be kept in full view at all times. This eventual goal will give
                                cohesion and force to the progress of the underdeveloped country
                                through its necessary stages. In Viet-Nam this cohesive force is
                                provided by the philosophical underpinnings of the Can Lao party,
                                i.e. personalism, community life and collective improvement. A
                                similar philosophical base must be found in every underdeveloped
                                country moving through its necessary stages.</item>

                            <item>Nhu said that the problem of bringing about [garble] precision of
                                these stages is one which calls for priority effort by the political
                                theorists and thinkers of the best American institutions. Only if
                                such a planned progression is achieved will we be able to avoid in
                                the long term the misunderstandings and criticisms which have marked
                                the press of Viet-Nam and the United States with regard to each
                                other in recent times.</item>

                            <item>Nhu stated that the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                visit and its results reminded him of an incident which brought the
                                delay of the arming and training of the Civil Guard. This occurred
                                in 1956 [?] when Ho Thong Minh, then Minister of Defense, advised
                                General <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Lawton Collins</persName> that
                                President Diem had no support within the army. As a result, he said,
                                the President planned to create a private army in the Civil Guard,
                                which would give him control of the situation. General <persName corresp="#p_CGJL1">Collins</persName> understandably accepted
                                this statement of a minister of the government and as a result
                                assistance to the Civil Guard was passed to United States Operations
                                Mission (<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>) and Michigan State
                                University (<gloss target="#t_MSU1">MSU</gloss>) which did not
                                prepare it to become a paramilitary force for local defense. As a
                                result of this comment by a minister, therefore, the training of the
                                most important arm for anti-guerrilla operations was delayed a
                                number of years. Nhu said that it was quite clear that General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had been exposed
                                to similar comments from very high officials in the government and
                                from outsiders. The results of their criticisms are now being
                                imposed on the President despite their errors. Nhu also said he had
                                the impression that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s mind was made up before he came to Vietnam,
                                as his investigations were quite limited.</item>

                            <item>On 27 November 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_NDD1">Ngo
                                    Dinh Diem</persName> said that the mission of General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell D. Taylor</persName> to South
                                Viet-Nam was somewhat similar to the mission of General Marshall to
                                China. In the latter case, General Marshall insisted that Chiang
                                Kai-shek divide his power with the Liberal Party, which had no
                                authority and represented nothing but a few intellectuals. The
                                American position after the Taylor Mission was completed bears
                                similarities, as it apparently wishes to impose some sort of
                                liberalization or change upon the Government of Viet-Nam (<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>) which is not suited to the present
                                situation or the Government’s structure. Diem said that he had been
                                trying for a long time to build the infra-structure of a democratic
                                system in South Viet-Nam but that he was faced with two major
                                obstacles, the war being waged by the Vietnamese Communists, and the
                                difficulty of finding loyal and efficient cadres for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>President Diem stated that he was conscious of the demand that
                                “emergency” action be taken and this he had tried to accomplish.
                                When discussing the specifics of “emergency” actions with such
                                political figures as Pham Huy Quat, leader of the Front for National
                                Unity, however, the President found nothing but vague and irrelevant
                                ideas about giving greater freedom propounded. He found that such
                                figures as Dr. <persName>Quat</persName> actively refused to accept
                                the real “emergency” actions necessary, such as immediate and severe
                                punishment of treason and cowardice in the face of the enemy. He
                                planned in the next few days to establish provincial councils, but
                                these would not be elected in the beginning but would be appointed
                                from non-party people in the area. A similar technique was used in
                                forming the National Economic Council which was nominated by various
                                interest groups. It was delayed by the difficulties of finding labor
                                representatives who were anything but Communist. Meanwhile
                                oppositionists such as Pham Huy Quat were currying favor with
                                potential foreign sponsors instead of helping the country to fight
                                during this period.</item>

                            <item>Another drawback to the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report recommendations was the experience of
                                the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with the Staley Report,
                                which was delivered with great fanfare and indicated that all sorts
                                of additional assistance would be forthcoming. The promised increase
                                in American <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0715"/>support had not
                                materialized to date. Diem stated that he had taken steps to
                                devaluate the recommendations.</item>

                            <item>The Vietnamese newspapers were commenting on the conditions stated
                                in the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Report,
                                according to Diem, and the press revealed the depth of the
                                antagonism of thinking Vietnamese to any conditions which they
                                believed limited <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> sovereignty.
                                Diem knew that his advisers and cabinet members would feel so
                                strongly on this subject that he had not exposed the specifics of
                                the <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> recommendations
                                to more than one or two individuals. (Field comment. Assistant

                                appropriately described as “frustrated” by the convergence of
                                problems upon him, including what he deemed the unreality of the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> conditions; the
                                extreme difficulty in locating appropriate individuals to whom power
                                could be delegated and who would accept it; the pressures of the
                                war; and, the fact that he had carefully consulted his Cabinet,
                                National Assembly members, and other advisers on the desirability of
                                receiving American troops, and now faced a difficult problem in
                                re-orienting them.)</item>

                            <item>President Diem also expressed considerable fury and bafflement at
                                how to handle American press representatives. He realized the
                                importance of the American press influence, but insisted that it
                                should assume responsibility commensurate with its power, and should
                                also realize that the backdrop to the Vietnamese scene being
                                reported is the Vietnamese Communist attack. He complained that if

                            is our best bet for success. Diem habitually takes quite a while to
                            react; he likes to take other people’s ideas and make them his own,
                            sometimes. I have indications that he is trying to come up with
                            something along lines we suggested, and I think it would be a mistake to

                            being airpouched:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister: I am happy to have your letter of November
                            thirteenth expressing your concern over the situation in South VietNam.
                            It is in no sense an intrusion, and I want you to know that I will
                            always welcome your thoughts and counsel. We <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0717"/>share the same objective of maintaining the peace and
                            promoting the well-being of Southeast Asia. I am sure that I need not
                            tell you that the United States has no ambitions for itself in the area;
                            our only desire is that independent countries of the area should be able
                            to maintain their independence, free from threats of force and from
                            externally supported subversion and infiltration. Unhappily, this is not
                            now the case in South VietNam.</p>
                        <p>“It is good to know that you have expressed to the Government in North
                            Viet-Nam your concern on this point; a continuation of its present
                            course cannot but endanger the peace. Although we are satisfied that the
                            Government of South Viet-Nam is prepared to live peacefully within the
                            Geneva Accords, the authorities in North Viet-Nam have done little to
                            conceal their disregard of those Accords and have openly and
                            systematically fomented efforts aimed at the violent overthrow of the
                            Government in South VietNam. This policy was openly proclaimed in the
                            declaration of the Third Lao Dong Party Congress in Hanoi in September
                            1960, which called upon its members to ‘liberate South Viet-Nam from the
                            ruling yoke of the United States imperialists.’ Three months later Hanoi
                            announced the creation of a ‘front for liberation of the South.’</p>
                        <p>“There have been many other public statements in the same vein from
                            Hanoi, and it is clear that there has been established in the South an
                            elaborate guerrilla organization supported, directed and supplied from
                            the North. The October 24, 1961, letter of the Government of Viet-Nam to
                            the International Control Commission<note n="3" xml:id="d297fn3">Not
                                printed. (Department of State, Central Files, 751K.00/11-861)</note>
                            set forth in what I am satisfied to be an objective and factual manner
                            detailed information and evidence with respect to the massive
                            infiltration from the North.</p>
                        <p>“While there may be varying assessments and points of view with respect
                            to the domestic policies of the Government of VietNam, it is the
                            legitimate government of an independent country and the freedom of the
                            people it represents is endangered, I am sure that you would agree that
                            it would be extremely difficult for any government, unaided, to cope
                            with externally supported attacks of the intensity of those now being
                            mounted with increasing crescendo against the Government of South
                            VietNam. I know that your own experience enables you, especially, to
                            appreciate the dangers which are now threatening the Government and
                            people of South VietNam.</p>
                        <p>“We are gravely concerned not only by the danger they face, but also by
                            the threat which Communist domination imposed from the outside would
                            present to the nations of Southeast Asia. I am sure you will agree that
                            this is a question in which our common interests are deeply
                            involved.</p>
                        <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0718"/>
                        <p>“The intention of my Government is to help South Viet-Nam by continuing
                            and considerably increasing the military assistance program which we
                            have been providing. At the same time we will step up economic aid in
                            connection with damage caused by the recent flood.</p>
                        <p>“In reply to the point raised in your letter, I would like to assure you
                            that we are not sending U.S. combat forces to VietNam. We are profoundly
                            aware of the grave questions which would be involved in such a decision
                            and I earnestly hope that we will not be faced by such an
                            eventuality.</p>
                        <p>“As to the nature of the crisis in VietNam, we are convinced by extensive
                            and detailed evidence that the increase in internal disorder and the
                            expansion of military operations against the Government are caused by a
                            massive campaign of infiltration, subversion, and terror directed and
                            reinforced from the outside. While this form of aggression is indirect,
                            it is very real.</p>
                        <p>“I am gratified that you have undertaken to let me have your views on
                            this grave matter and I believe that on most points our views coincide.
                            Certainly as events unfold and as this Government considers future
                            actions to help the people and Government of South Viet-Nam stop the
                            forces which threaten their independence, I shall have in mind your
                            thoughts and welcome counsel.</p>
                        <p>“Sincerely, <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">John F. Kennedy</persName>.”</p>
                        <p>White House and Dept do not plan release text. Suggest you confirm with
                            Burmese our assumption they will not release.</p>

                            Ellender paid us a one-day visit on November 29th. He saw all members of
                            Task Force Saigon and received answers to his questionnaire,<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">Not further identified.</note> sent in advance <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0719"/>of his arrival. His general
                            attitude towards our policy, plans, and efforts here was totally
                            negative.</p>
                        <p>During a long discussion at my home on the evening of his arrival, I
                            tried to give Senator Ellender as candid a picture as I could of what we
                            are trying to do here. Starting from completely different premises, he
                            naturally did not agree with our policy. His premises, as the Department
                            doubtless knows, are: <list>

                        <p rend="flushleft">I was unable to sway him from these extraordinary
                            views.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of his arrival, Senator Ellender requested an appointment
                            with President Diem for the next day. After hearing Senator Ellender’s
                            views, which he said he intended to give to Diem (whom he said he had
                            seen on every previous visit to VietNam), I decided it would be most
                            unwise in the present circumstances to promote the meeting. I told
                            Senator Ellender that I thought it would be impossible on such short
                            notice to arrange a meeting with President Diem. I further told him that
                            if President Diem had any time, I myself wished to see him on urgent and
                            important business, and that it would be very awkward for me at this
                            juncture to ask Diem to see Senator Ellender. The Senator would not,
                            however, withdraw his request to me to arrange an appointment.</p>
                        <p>The next day I got in touch with Thuan, telling him that Senator Ellender
                            was in town and wanted to see President Diem, but that in view of the
                            shortness of time and the President’s many preoccupations, I would tell
                            Senator Ellender that President Diem was unfortunately unable to see him
                            on such short notice. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>
                            agreed and I did so. Senator Ellender was markedly displeased at not
                            being able to see Diem, and said that he was going to write a letter
                            expressing his regret to President Diem, after his departure. I will
                            take care of this angle through <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>.</p>

                            up after Senator Ellender’s return to Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">In his reply of December 8, Johnson wrote that
                                Ellender’s “views with regard to Viet-Nam are hardly surprising in
                                the light of his well-known views on other areas.” Johnson expressed
                                approval of the way <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>
                                had handled the incident and promised to bring <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>’s letter to the attention
                                of the Bureaus of Congressional Affairs and Far Eastern Affairs.

                            off rails from standpoint US-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            coordination and that <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            recommendations to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, whatever may be
                            their intrinsic merit, are bound to complicate our task of bringing
                            about essential reforms in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military
                            and administrative structure. Position may be retrievable (and we are
                            working at it). But as of now British initiative has introduced knotty
                            problem in our discussions with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Difficulties with Thompson Mission have been procedural and substantive.
                            Procedurally, problem has been that <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> has submitted his recommendations to President
                            Diem without prior consultation with US and without real effort to
                            ascertain thrust of our plans or programs for counterinsurgency. This
                            has occurred despite what I considered most precise prior understanding
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HHAF1">Hohler</persName> that
                            advance consultation was essential if two pitfalls were to be avoided:
                            (1) That we should present alternative recommendations to Diem between
                            which he could vacillate without acting on either; and (2) That British
                            would present recommendations which we for one reason or another could
                            not or would not support and which would therefore be sterile (given
                            fact that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> not contributing
                            substantially to anti-<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> effort beyond
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> recommendations).
                            Second procedural point fully agreed with <persName corresp="#p_HHAF1">Hohler</persName>
                            <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0721"/>was that Thompson would
                            strictly limit himself to intelligence and civil aspects of
                            counterinsurgency effort.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_HHAF1">Hohler</persName> does not deny
                            that there was clear understanding on above points-and I have had
                            occasion to remind him of them several times recently-fact is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> has disregarded
                            them. Only defense offered is that General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> specifically requested <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>’s views without limitation as
                            to subject matter (I have this only from <persName corresp="#p_HHAF1">Hohler</persName>)<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">In telegram 717 to
                                Saigon, December 1, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                told <persName>Nolting</persName> that he had informally discussed
                                with <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> the situation
                                in Viet-Nam and had expressed “interest in <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>’s views.” <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he had been “greatly
                                surprised” to receive from the British Embassy a copy of <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>’s October 27 paper,
                                “Appreciation of Vietnam, November 1961 to April 1962” (not
                                printed). <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that
                                if it seemed useful to Nolting, he might mention to the British
                                Ambassador that <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                                thought <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> had
                                misunderstood his request and suggested it be forgotten. (Ibid.,
                                751K.00/12-161) In a covering memorandum of December 1 to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> with the text of
                                this message, <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> stated
                                that he was “somewhat disturbed” that “<persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> was using me as a kind of screen for his
                                out-of-channel operations in Saigon.” (Ibid.)</note> and that as
                            Thompson Mission is accredited to Diem he must respond to latter’s
                            requests.</p>
                        <p>Although British performance is procedurally incorrect, substantively it
                            is far more serious. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            has submitted to Diem so-called “outline plan” for clearing delta
                            (Embdes 205, Nov. 20).<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">See <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note> This paper deals with
                            whole range of anti-guerrilla measures, including all aspects of
                            military. It is an admirable paper from standpoint of presentation and
                            as a statement of concepts of anti-guerrilla operations. We can easily
                            agree with ninety per cent of it and have in fact been pressing same or
                            similar concepts on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for many
                            months.</p>
                        <p>Problem arises in unexpected way. We have been pressing Diem to set up a
                            proper military command structure headed by field command and to
                            delegate authority to it. Diem accepted this most reluctantly six months
                            ago, but has never fully carried through on it, and recently there have
                            been several instances of direct orders from palace to <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units without field commands
                            knowledge. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> proposal for
                            delta provides that control of operations in that area bypass field
                            command (since chain of command would be from <gloss target="#t_NISC1">NISC</gloss> to Combined Third Corps <gloss target="#t_Hq1">HQ</gloss>) and operational control would thus in effect be
                            exercised by Diem. This point has obviously not escaped President.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> has already informed
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> that Diem has
                            “accepted” <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> plan and
                            inquired whether <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has any comments
                            on it. Diem has also asked <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> to submit plan for clearing area north of
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to suggest by above that I consider Diem’s reaction to
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> plan is motivated
                            solely by desire avoid delegation of authority which we have been
                            pressing on him, <pb n="700" xml:id="pg_700" facs="0722"/>although this
                            is without doubt a major factor. Another is very likely a reaction to
                            our approach in current negotiations. Nor do I wish to suggest that we
                            are being doctrinaire in our reaction, which I think is not the case.
                            Fundamentally, problem is that we are convinced that unless we can bring
                            Diem to delegate authority we shall never get effective
                            counterinsurgency effort in this country, no matter what sort of paper
                            plans we may have. <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            proposal, particularly coming at this juncture, strikes a hard blow at
                            this effort.</p>
                        <p>A second major substantive difficulty with <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> plan is proposal that clearance of delta
                            provinces have first priority. In <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            view first priority is area to north of Saigon-which <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> had not surveyed at time he
                            submitted his delta plan to Diem.</p>
                        <p>At meeting with <persName corresp="#p_HHAF1">Hohler</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> November 29, at
                            which <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> and Trueheart
                            present, I spoke along above lines very frankly and even bluntly,
                            emphasizing that I feared <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> plan would be distinct handicap in discussions
                            which I am now carrying on with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. I
                            also warned them that if, as I expected, Diem raised <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> plan in these discussions, I
                            would have to tell him that we did not agree with command arrangements
                            proposed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HHAF1">Hohler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> ostensibly accepted all this
                            with good grace and reiterated their desire to cooperate closely with US
                            and by implication to play role of junior partner in this enterprise. I
                            sense nevertheless that <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName>
                            is thoroughly annoyed.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> Plan in detail with

                                    weak but confused. In its present form I seriously question
                                    whether it can create stability within its own borders

                        <p>I said that you would surely disagree on a. and b. His argument was that
                            appointment of a US “Commander” would amount to an irrevocable and 100%
                            US commitment to saving South Vietnam. I disputed this, and said it
                            would be no more than a slight addition in a situation where, in the
                            eyes of the world, we were already overwhelmingly committed. I also said
                            you regarded the 4-star rank as crucial to the positive impact of the
                            change.</p>

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">AID View</hi>. The preliminary view (Frank Coffin)
                            is that the key issue is control of the allocation of local currency
                            generated by the commodity import program. This is now in the
                            Ambassador, who <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0725"/>also retains
                            the final refereeing of any disputes between <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> and the military. These two do have a working
                            agreement, under which all military-related projects (roads,
                            telecommunications, village communications, police support) are subject
                            to full coordination; disputes are said to have been minor in recent
                            months (I have heard the contrary about earlier periods).</p>
                        <p>Coffin’s view is that the present system should be maintained (which
                            could be accomplished by substituting the word “Coordinate” for the
                            words ’Supervise and direct …<note n="4" xml:id="d301fn4">Ellipsis in
                                the source text.</note> Diplomatic Mission” in paragraph 5 e. of the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> draft) or that the whole
                            direction of <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> should pass to the
                            military commander-that there was no happy middle ground. I think there
                            is a strong case for the second action as we go along, but would be much
                            influenced by <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>’s views. Again, Felt has not
                            included the point in his draft of proposed powers.</p>
                        <p>4. Summary. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and AID issues seem
                            resolvable, although there should certainly be a high-level meeting of
                            minds and fully coordinated instructions both giving the text and
                            glossing it. However, the State view strikes at the heart of the whole
                            proposal, and is not acceptable in my judgment. I recommend that you: <list>

                                    made.</item>

                            only after it was brought to his attention by <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> and Tuyen that Nhu’s role was
                            revealed. Meanwhile, Dr. <persName>Tho</persName> had issued a directive
                            to the Vietnamese press which went far beyond Nhu’s instructions.
                            Certainly there were references throughout the week’s campaign to
                            American reportage on Vietnam-particularly in the New York Times-but
                            this appeared quite patently a “hook” on which to hang a much broader
                            critique of U.S. policies and practices. Little bits of pieces of
                            information gleaned from statements made here and in Washington about
                            US/Vietnamese “negotiations” were interpreted with a heavy dollop of
                            imagination as a means of leveling charges of “interference” and
                            “conditional aid” against the United States.</p>
                        <p>Although as many as half a dozen newspapers joined in the fracas in the
                            first few days, they all seemed to run out of steam early in the week
                            beginning Monday, November 27 and their comments became either
                            ridiculous and/or considerably less vitriolic. Part of this may have
                            been due to a conversation between Dr. <persName>Tho</persName> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_PAO1">PAO</gloss> on Monday (which Khoi had
                            accurately predicted almost to the minute during his call).</p>
                        <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0727"/>
                        <p>In a two-hour conversation, Dr. <persName>Tho</persName> said that he had
                            discussed the Thoi Bao articles with the publisher whom he described as
                            a “sincere man who accepts full responsibility” for the articles which
                            were inspired by “tendentious” reportage and commentary in the American
                            press in recent weeks. These articles have reportedly not only more than
                            doubled the newspapers’ sales but had inspired tracts by persons
                            unknown, saying “Ami Go Home” which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has picked up in Gia Dinh. Dr. <persName>Tho</persName>
                            reminded us of his stand against freedom of the press and stated that
                            here was proof of the correctness of this stand. If other newspapers
                            continue to follow Thoi Bao’s lead, elements of the population would be
                            inflamed to continued anti-American actions, <persName>Tho</persName>
                            predicted.</p>
                        <p>There followed further discussion in which we pointed out that the
                            newspapers here had a right to criticize American reporting from
                            Vietnam, but this should really not be a springboard for a massive
                            condemnation of the American Government and people as
                            “Capitalist-Imperialists.” Dr. <persName>Tho</persName> then proposed
                            that if the American Government could prevail upon the American press to
                            “report correctly” about Viet-Nam that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, through his office, would be able to “persuade” the
                            Vietnamese press to desist in their present anti-American effort.</p>
                        <p>We made a thorough explanation of how U.S. press relations are conducted,
                            pointing out the difficulties in preventing speculative stories.
                                <persName>Tho</persName> noted that the State Department should be
                            asked to call “erroneous reporting” to the attention of U.S. editors. We
                            stated that wherever possible, this was done but that our government was
                            not in a position to dictate what the press should print. I said,
                            further, that because of the nature of the situation, we could not offer
                            alternative true copy, in this case as in others.</p>
                        <p>One of the questions <persName>Tho</persName> asked was whether the legal
                            principle “the right of response” was accepted in the U.S. so far as
                            press reporting and commentary are concerned. This was a reference to
                            the requirement by law in many countries that a newspaper most [must]
                            provide equal space and equal prominence to counter-charges or at least
                            to a defense against charges against an individual or a
                            government-completely apart from the laws of libel. Of course, my
                            response was in the negative, although I did point out that in this
                            particular instance as in others, any newspaper which had published
                            information thought to be “damaging” against the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, for example, would be happy to respond to an offer
                            from the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Ambassador in Washington to
                            grant an interview to the newspaper in which the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s position could be re-stated. However, there is no
                            U.S. Government regulation of the press in America except for the law of
                            libel and certain postal regulations. Dr. <persName>Tho</persName>
                            smiled benignly at this and echoed his predecessor’s sentiments that
                            eventually the U.S. <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0728"/>would
                            realize that complete press freedom without some form of government
                            regulation simply gives free run to irresponsibility and in these times
                            may lead to real danger in the national interests. I smiled benignly,
                            too.</p>
                        <p>I don’t think we got anywhere, really, except to “recognize” each other’s
                            problems. We could make no promises about the American press of course;
                            we are walking on eggs as it is. However, we left the Director General
                            with the assurances we would do what we could; but we were impressed
                            also with his concern over what he had done in response to Brother Nhu’s
                            directive.</p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, the only possible thing we could do in reaction
                            to the press campaign itself is to consider it-apart from its source and
                            the way in which it was conducted-a favorable sign of intellectual
                            muscle-flexing on the part of newspaper editors which fundamentally is
                            encouraging.</p>

                        <p>748. Marathon discussion with Diem this evening (Dec. 1) started on
                            negative note, but improved over course of four hours to a point from
                            which I think we may find meeting of our essential interests. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> was present throughout, and he

                            of course, to Diem’s approval, but will be forwarded as soon as
                            possible. We need a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> paper for sake
                            of clarity and precision.</p>
                        <p>Diem did not retreat much from his basic conviction that Vietnamese
                            conflict must be won by non-Communist Vietnamese nationalists and that
                            American influence in his government, if publicly known, would be
                            disadvantageous. On other hand he expressed gratitude for President

                            under what he regards as unjustified criticism of him, his family, and

                            increasingly pervaded local political scene given additional fillip by
                            Nhu’s anti-American gambit in Vietnamese press. At present, however, no
                            firm indications pointing to any group (categorized below) actively
                            preparing as dynamic element in overthrow <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Civilian opposition groups, within Viet-Nam and also including those

                            future government. They are not believed have capability acting as

                        <p>The generals and senior military officers are clearly frustrated by

                            To carry off coup, however, they would have to establish united front
                            and insure that subordinate commanders would follow their lead. Both
                            would require considerable conspiring of which we have no active
                            indications at this time and would face major dilemma between desire for
                            change and still strong personal prestige and authority of Diem.</p>
                        <p>Major area of our uncertainty is among field grade officers particularly
                            of elite groups who as unit commanders could force senior officers’ hand
                            by mounting coup similar to November 1960. Our coverage political
                            attitudes and possible plotting these groups is still inadequate but it

                        <p>Despite this current appraisal, it must be expected that discussions and

                                transmitted to the Department of State the text of a memorandum of
                                understanding cleared with Diem that morning for submission ad
                                referendum to the U.S. Government. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 751K.00/12-461)</note> Believe it desirable I then fly to
                            Washington to consult on next moves. If this approved think I should
                            tell press here that I am returning at my own suggestion in order to
                            give my government a full account of discussions which have taken place
                            and, hopefully, to conclude arrangements on which we have been working
                            with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As indication substance of Diem’s position, based on discussions Friday,
                            following is pertinent. When we got down to brass tacks, I asked Diem to
                            say what he could and would do under two broad headings: measures to
                            improve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efficiency (in all fields,
                            including military) and measures to improve <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> public image at home and abroad (to gain more active
                            and widespread public support).</p>
                        <p>On efficiency, Diem noted what he has done and what he plans to do, at
                            same time stressing shortage of competent people and need to develop
                            administrative skills. He agreed to reactivate National Internal
                            Security Council, to have it meet regularly as “war cabinet”, to create
                            a secretariat for it, and to conduct government security business
                            through it. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said today that
                            this step, in his judgment, is best way to organize national effort at
                            top, to accomplish delegation of authority, and to bring about more
                            efficient governmental action. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said President expects to have <gloss target="#t_NISC1">NISC</gloss> meet regularly twice a week. Diem
                            also said that next week he would issue decree setting up Provincial
                            Councils in all provinces which would have advisory and real powers
                            vis-a-vis the province chiefs. These councils would be appointed in
                            first instance, from people who had shown themselves to be “most active
                            anti-communist patriots” regardless of party or occupation; idea was to
                            have them eventually elected. Diem was at first very cool to offer of
                            selected Americans to help in administrative organs, taking position
                            that this would not work out in practice, that nationalistic Vietnamese
                            would resent it and Viet Cong would capitalize on it, and especially
                            that he could not afford to admit publicly that he had to call on
                            Americans to help administer his national revolution. He was blunt here
                            in stating, citing cases in which Americans got frustrated when things
                            were not done “their way”, causing resentment among Vietnamese. He said
                            he would not wish to build up situation like that which resulted in
                            anti-American blow-out in Taiwan some time ago. I made clear that we did
                            not want to force any American advisors upon him, but that we needed
                            assurance of strengthened <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            administration. What did he propose? He said he recognized that <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0732"/>certain Americans, on selective
                            basis and on request, could help strengthen his government. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> confirmed this. I said this was
                            exactly our idea. (This is something that can be worked out, I think, on
                            an ad hoc and ad hominem basis, but not in any overall sense and not
                            publicly.) On military command, especially on full and unimpeded
                            authority to Field Command to plan and conduct field operations, Diem
                            stated flatly and repeated several times that he had given his military
                            command full authority, had made it clear over many months that he
                            counted on Field Command to plan and conduct military operations with
                            full authority and control of <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            forces, that he had not interfered either in plans or in troop
                            dispositions, but that he had been sadly disappointed in results. “They
                            tell you”, he said, “that I interfere to hide their own incompetence and
                            lack of initiative.” This was a blunt and apparently sincere statement
                            of a most serious situation. It conflicts, of course, with many
                            allegations from <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military about
                            Palace interference. In any case I asked Diem how I could recommend that
                            the US invest more heavily in a military machine that was admittedly not
                            effective in overall organization and operation, although, as he had
                            said, individual units fight well. I said we had to have systematic
                            planning and strong, competent overall military direction if we were to
                            support effectively. Could an American, or Americans, help here? Diem
                            would not answer directly, but said he recognized that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military establishment had to be
                            “reorganized.” When I came back to the point, Diem said he hoped General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> would help General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> to fullest extent in his
                            planning and would urge him to take the offensive, specifically a major
                            offensive against <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone D</gloss>. (General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> has, as reported,
                            been doing just that for many months.) <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said later that part of difficulty in this regard
                            is personal friction between General <persName corresp="#p_DVM1">Minh</persName> and General Thanh,<gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> Chief of Staff. On our requirement for coordination in
                            planning and operations between <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            commanders and US command of any US operational units (e.g., helicopter
                            squadrons), Diem was clear and affirmative. In such cases, he recognized
                            that there must be full cooperation in planning and operations and
                            neither party would take an action or decision affecting the other
                            without prior frank consultation. Summing up the discussion on the point
                            of improving <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> efficiency, I said
                            President Diem had stated certain things that held some promise of
                            improvement, but that frankly I was still not in position satisfactorily
                            to answer root question on mind of my government when it considering
                            sending reenforcements to VietNam-i.e., why is it that with forces now
                            available, and with resources built up over seven years, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has not been able to mount a systematic
                            and effective effort against an enemy estimated at 20,000 armed men? I
                            thought inadequate governmental organization <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0733"/>was part of the answer, and I did not think sufficient
                            remedial measures for this had yet been suggested by President Diem.</p>
                        <p>On improvement of public image, President’s attitude was one of sincere
                            regret, at times edging on anger, that he had been misunderstood and
                            misrepresented, especially abroad. He spoke earnestly along familiar
                            lines of the need to build in Viet-Nam the “infrastructure of democracy”
                            (education, sense of civic responsibility, administrative skills,
                            political toleration); that infrastructure comes before “superstructure”
                            of democracy, which can only come at a later stage, though as rapidly as
                            possible. Over and over, Diem stressed his view that key to wider public
                            support for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and himself is ability
                            of government to provide protection to its people, this to be followed
                            by the steady building of “infrastructure of democracy.” No amount of
                            window dressing, he argued, could substitute for the hard measures of
                            self-sacrifice required to win against the Viet-Cong. This is a battle
                            for the “hearts and minds” of the people; their basic sentiments are
                            anti-communist; they must be given protection from terror in order to
                            demonstrate their true allegiance. On specific measures discussed, he
                            agreed that he should “get to the people more”, by more visits (he
                            already travels frequently and widely) and by more frequent radio talks.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said later that Diem
                            had agreed to talk over the radio at least once a month. On broadening
                            the base of his government, he was generally negative; said that taking
                            in dissidents or fence sitters in any broad government reorganization
                            would not do any good and miss the point. Specifically on taking in a
                            labor leader, Diem said that Buu was at cross purposes with the other
                            principal trade unionists, and that to take any one or all of them in
                            would not be practical or feasible. On release of political prisoners,
                            Diem said that there are two kinds: communists, most of whom have
                            committed crimes, who are in “rehabilitation camps”, and are released
                            periodically; about 30 who were active in November Coup, for whom public
                            trials are being prepared. In summary, on this subject, Diem stuck to
                            his guns; took little interest in any suggestions about measures to
                            improve his public image; gave every impression that, so far as his own
                            country is concerned, he felt confident in his judgment as a political
                            leader and did not evidence concern about opinion outside.</p>
                        <p>I stressed throughout our requirement for a closer and more effective
                            partnership. His reply in essence was that he cannot share the
                            responsibility of governing South Viet-Nam with the United States; but
                            that within that principle he too wanted to establish a closer and more
                            effective partnership. In probing for specifics, I found some
                            willingness to have US advisors on a selective and agreed basis in
                            intelligence (both civilian and military), in military planning and
                            operations, in joint provincial surveys (where however <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0734"/>he insisted that these should be
                            focused on intelligence and military aspects, not on political and
                            social). <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said today that
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> prepared to organize surveys
                            this month and that political and social matters could be inquired into,
                            but this could not be advertised. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> also confirmed that the Border Ranger Force
                            suggested by General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            could be organized and that sufficient ranger companies could be pried
                            loose from static guard duty to form a force of from four to five
                            thousand men.</p>
                        <p>I realize the above is not a clear picture. It is sent only as a raw
                            report. I will attempt set down the essentials in a paper to be approved
                            by Diem, with <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>’s assistance.
                            I hope no decisions will be reached in Washington prior to this
                            subsequent report. My own thinking, with full regard to the gravity of
                            contemplated US moves, is that we can develop a base sufficiently solid
                            to give positive results and to turn the tide here in our favor. While I
                            think we can, on a case by case basis, work out arrangements for mutual
                            cooperation and execution of a stepped-up effort, I do not think that
                            the “public image” can be substantially improved unless and until the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> begins to win the war against
                            the Viet-Cong. I believe that the tide can be turned with the limited
                            concessions which Diem is prepared to make now and others that we can
                            obtain on piece meal basis. In sum, I believe that we should proceed
                            with confidence.</p>

                                which have been agreed in recent discussions between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the U.S.</p>

                                <item>The basic immediate objective is to enable the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to take and maintain the
                                    offensive against the Viet Cong. The basic long-range objective
                                    is to enable South Viet-Nam to develop its freely-chosen
                                    institutions in peace and security.</item>

                                <item>To accomplish this, an increased Vietnamese effort will be
                                    mounted. The fundamental responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for the conduct of the war will
                                    not be impaired. A closer and more effective relationship will
                                    be established, however, between the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the U.S.A.</item>

                                    with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. This will involve
                                    increases in forms of aid previously furnished and, in addition,
                                    fundamentally new steps in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>-U.S. collaboration, namely, (a) the participation
                                    of U.S. uniformed personnel in operational missions with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces, and (b) closer
                                    consultation with U.S. advisers, as agreed, in planning the
                                    conduct of the security effort.</item>

                        <p>A final direct word from me on South VietNam, as a member of your
                            personal staff.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that all the choppers and other gadgetry we can supply
                            South Viet-Nam will buy time and render their resources effective if we
                            do not get a first class man out there to replace <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> is an excellent officer, but
                            he lacks the critical qualities to make this partnership move. At the
                            moment the problem is tied up in a disagreement between State and
                            Defense on the kind of structural command changes-if any-that are
                            necessary. In my view the structural command changes are virtually
                            irrelevant; what we need is a young Van Fleet. In addition, it is
                            equally crucial that we free <persName corresp="#p_LBGEG1">Ed

                            the field in an appropriate position. He is a unique national asset in
                            the Saigon setting; and I cannot believe that anything he may be able to
                            do in his present assignment could match his value in Southeast Asia. On
                            this matter you may have to have a word with the Attorney General.<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2"><persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>

                                “lay deep in the American military and the civil bureaucracy. The

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName>:</hi> I attach our proposed concept for elevating
                            the status of the senior US military man in Viet-Nam to that of a
                            “Commander, US Forces Vietnam”. This draft reflects discussions with
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and AID, and is a revision of an
                            earlier draft.<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note></p>
                        <p>Essentially, I believe that if we are to give full impact to the
                            increased efforts we are now making, and to take full advantage of the
                            additional weight that the <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>-Diem memorandum<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">The
                                enclosure to <ref target="#d307">Document 307</ref>.</note> gives us
                            in the conduct of the counter-insurgency effort, we must signalize the
                            change by such an elevation of the senior military man. The attached
                            proposal would give him a status, under <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, comparable to that now held by the Taiwan Defense
                            Command, by the US Commander in Japan, and by the Commander in Korea,
                            who is of course also the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Commander.</p>
                        <p>The attached draft would maintain the existing situation vis-a-vis AID
                            activities, with the military role confined to the coordination of those
                            AID activities that have a clear relationship to the counterinsurgency
                            effort. I understand that full coordination now prevails for such
                            activities as roads, telecommunications, and police support. We propose
                            no change in this.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The attached proposal envisages a relationship with the Ambassador that
                            falls within the terms of the President’s basic letter of May 29,
                                1961,<note n="4" xml:id="d312fn4">See <ref target="#d271fn5">footnote 5, Document 271</ref>.</note> i.e., that an area
                            “military commander” is not under the Ambassador’s command, but retains
                            his direct line of authority via the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            to me and thence to the President. Obviously, political and basic policy
                            matters must remain in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>’s hands. We must of course take every precaution
                            so that neither Diem, nor anyone else, can play off the two senior US
                            representatives against each other. But the military man should have his
                            status enhanced if he is to move into a new and more active role, and
                            should have complete access to Diem and all other top <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials on matters connected with the
                            counter-insurgency effort, keeping the Ambassador fully advised. I need
                            hardly say that in our nomination <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0743"/>for the position we shall give weight to capacity to
                            work cooperatively under such an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I should like to get a resolution of this issue as soon as possible, and
                            to have your views before I go to Honolulu direct from Paris.<note n="5" xml:id="d312fn5"><persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>

                        <p>On December 8, 1961, the Department of State announced that it had
                            released a two-part report entitled A Threat to the Peace: North
                            VietNam’s Effort to Conquer South VietNam, which had been referred to
                            informally within the government as the Jorden Report. A transcript of
                            the Secretary of State’s news conference that day, at which he issued a
                            statement regarding the release of the report and responded to questions
                            about Vietnam, is in Department of State Bulletin, December 25, 1961,

                        <p>Part I of the report consisted of an introduction and the following eight

                        <p>Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">W. Averell
                                Harriman</persName> held four separate meetings on December 7 with
                            representatives of the Vietnamese, Australian, French, British, New
                            Zealand, Pakistan, Philippine, Thai, Indian, and Canadian Embassies in
                            Washington to present them copies of the publication and brief them on
                            its contents. A composite memorandum of these four conversations,
                            drafted by C. Benjamin Wood, is in Department of State, Central Files,
                            751K.00/12-761. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> also met
                            separately with British Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_OGD1">David
                                Ormsby Gore</persName> that day. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>’s memorandum of the conversation as it related
                            to Viet-Nam reads: <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0748"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I gave the British Ambassador copies of the Viet-Nam White
                                    Paper. After a discussion of it, the Ambassador raised the
                                    subject of whether the Soviet Government as a co-chairman should
                                    be called upon to use its influence to end the aggressive
                                    actions to the North Vietnamese. He said his government felt
                                    that to approach them now might be considered a sign of
                                    weakness, and that it might be more effective if done after some
                                    progress had been made in putting down the guerrillas or after
                                    an important victory was won.</p>
                                <p>“I replied that I understood this question was still under
                                    discussion. The argument for doing it now was that it might be
                                    some time before the situation improved. Obviously, if the
                                    approach was made now, it must be vigorous. It should include an
                                    expression of firm determination to prevent South VietNam’s
                                    being taken over by force and to warn the Soviets not to permit
                                    escalation. He said he expected the matter would come up in
                                    discussions between Lord <persName corresp="#p_HDAF1">Home</persName> and the Secretary in Paris. He mentioned
                                    also the activities of the Thompson group, expressing the hope
                                    that they would achieve the objectives of assisting Viet-Nam
                                    without interfering with <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.
                                    I told him that we were anxious that the <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> mission should
                                    continue and believed that such minor differences that occurred
                                    could be straightened out in Saigon.</p>
                                <p>“I emphasized our determination to support Viet-Nam and that the
                                    dispatch of combat forces was not excluded. He indicated that
                                    the British Government agreed it was wise to make sure the North
                                    Vietnamese understood this.” (Ibid., 751K.00/12-961)</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that the talks with Diem had led to considerable
                            agreement and that additional steps are being taken to deal with the
                            guerilla problem: improving intelligence, regrouping forces, improving
                            civilian and military channels so as to improve action capability. We
                            are providing additional economic and military support. Our objective is
                            to help Viet-Nam do the job itself. We do not have in mind for the
                            present sending organized units of American ground forces. We will
                            supply aircraft and helicopters with American pilots. So far as the
                            Geneva Accords are concerned, we want to concentrate on continuing
                            violations from the North. We do not believe we are in violation because
                            the relevant provisions have been suspended by the actions taken by
                            North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HDAF1">Home</persName> said that he agreed
                            that Diem must be helped to fight and that he should be able to clean up
                            the bad areas. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is concerned about
                            the Geneva Accords. He hoped the US Government would not announce
                            publicly that it is not bound by the <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0750"/>Geneva settlement. It would render the British
                            co-Chairman position difficult and might have an adverse effect in
                            Laos….</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have tried to avoid statements on the Geneva
                            Accords. If questions are asked it would seem preferable to turn the
                            question around to inquire into what the North is doing. If, in time,
                            the other side comes into compliance, then we can cease extraordinary
                            assistance. We can leave the Accords and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName>’s statement<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">For Under Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith’s

                        <p>Tosec 32. Following is draft of suggested reply to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s letter to you of December
                                7<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2"><ref target="#d312">Document
                                312</ref>.</note> on command relationships in VietNam. Draft has
                            been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">Bundy</persName> in
                            Defense and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, and
                            has approval of Department. If you concur, suggest it be transmitted to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> prior to his
                            departure for Honolulu. (Assume McNamara has available there copy of his
                            7 December letter to you.)</p>
                        <p>“Following are my comments on your proposed concept for elevating the
                            status of the senior US military man in Viet-Nam as outlined in your
                            letter of December 7.</p>
                        <p>“I completely agree with you that we must take full advantage of the new
                            undertakings by the Government of South Viet-Nam in order to produce a
                            return consonant with the effort we are making there. In doing this, we
                            must carefully avoid any appearance of ‘taking over’ or stressing the
                            ‘big partner’ relationship with the <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0751"/>Government of VietNam. We should also exhibit
                            scrupulous regard for Vietnamese national pride and avoid, insofar as
                            possible, giving the Communists any grounds for casting the United
                            States in the role of VietNam’s former French masters, or of picturing
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> as a puppet regime of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>“Finally, I believe we must keep in mind the special nature of the effort
                            to suppress the Viet Cong. While the threat continues to grow, it
                            essentially retains the features of a guerrilla war. Viet-Nam may be a
                            combat theater, but it is not yet such a theater in the conventional
                            sense of the term. As you know, there are no present plans to send US
                            combat troops to VietNam.</p>
                        <p>“The immediate object of both sides is the loyalty of the populace. The
                            role of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is to seek out and
                            destroy the Communist partisans, but, without the support of the people
                            and the resources of the hinterland, the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> would have little chance of accomplishing its
                            mission. Also, if the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> were to fail
                            to marshal its resources effectively, no amount of American aid alone
                            could save the day. Clearly, in this all-embracing conflict, virtually
                            every activity of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and the
                            Country Team is related to the counter-insurgency effort.’</p>
                        <p>“Accordingly, I believe we should design a command arrangement which
                            recognizes a predominantly advisory and supporting role of the American
                            military to the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>-a role which
                            acknowledges the dual politico-military nature of the counter-insurgency
                            effort, which accommodates Vietnamese nationalist sensibilities and
                            which clearly continues to lodge local authority and responsibility for
                            basic US policy with the Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>“I also believe that the situation in Viet-Nam differs not only from that
                            of the normal and usual <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            contemplated in the President’s basic letter of May 29, 1961,<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">See <ref target="#d271fn5">footnote 5. Document
                                    271</ref>.</note> but also from that of an ‘area military
                            commander’ who exercises command authority with respect to an ‘area’
                            extending beyond the borders of a single country.</p>
                        <p>“At the same time, American military assistance to the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> is a separable element of the
                            over-all American program of assistance to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in suppressing the Communist guerrillas. On the
                            military level and in conformity with basic policy, the senior American
                            military officer should be free to make appropriate arrangements for
                            lateral contacts with <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, to plan
                            military operations and to make decisions. This system proved its
                            validity in Greece and I believe we would be well advised to adhere to
                            it now. I agree with you that, regardless of the care exercised by the
                            senior American <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0752"/>officials, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would seek to exploit a system
                            of divided authority. We should present the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> with no such temptation.</p>
                        <p>“Although the senior US military officer in South Viet-Nam will have
                            certain US forces under his operational command, at this stage of the
                            conflict his major role would be that of a staff officer, of [<hi rend="italic">a</hi>] <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>
                            military adviser and planner. Should the character of the conflict
                            change and should the US assume responsibility for the conduct of the
                            campaign, as in Korea, his function could be changed very quickly.</p>
                        <p>“I suggest that it may be possible best to reflect the foregoing
                            situation by converting the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> into a
                            ‘military assistance command’ with a joint staff and Service components,
                            the commander’s title to be ‘Commander, US Military Assistance Command,
                            VietNam’. Another alternative might be to retain the title of Chief of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> for the senior military
                            representative in Viet-Nam by giving him the concurrent title of
                            ‘Commander, US Forces, VietNam’. In any event, I consider it important
                            to retain the concept of ‘military assistance’ and avoid any implication
                            that the US is assuming full responsibility for and direction of all of
                            the military effort in VietNam.</p>
                        <p>“I agree with you that, whatever title and command arrangement is
                            eventually adopted, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> should retain responsibility for political and
                            basic over-all policy matters. While the senior US military
                            representative should have responsibility for the conduct of military
                            operations, training, and other clearly military matters, with, of
                            course, direct communication to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> on such matters and economic aid related thereto,
                            in view of the dual nature of the conflict, I believe it important that
                            he receive guidance from the Ambassador on all other matters. In cases
                            of differences of view, both representatives would, of course, be free
                            to communicate such differences to Washington for decision in accordance
                            with already existing procedures. I would expect that, in accordance
                            with arrangements worked out with the Ambassador, the senior US military
                            representative would directly furnish advice to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, including President Diem, on all
                            matters relative to security and maintaining internal security in South
                            Viet-Nam and to the organization and employment of the <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>, keeping the Ambassador
                            appropriately informed of his actions.</p>
                        <p>“I will look forward to discussing this question further with you in the
                            light of the results of your visit to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> with the view of promptly recommending to the
                            President decisions that will enable us more effectively and vigorously
                            to pursue our objectives with respect to VietNam”.</p>

                        <p>801. Deputy Under Secretary Johnson from <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>. Thanks for your 760,<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">Telegram 760, December 10, summarized the contents
                                of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>’s letter of

                                that publicly the new commander should continue to be known as Chief
                                of the Military Assistance Advisory Group. The telegram asked for
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>’s comments and
                                suggestions. (Ibid., 751K.00/12-1061)</note> which I have studied
                            closely.</p>
                        <p>Regret to say I have most serious concerns with what is apparently
                            proposed as it applies to complex problem of VietNam. The Communist
                            insurgency in Viet-Nam is as you know, carried on by political,
                            psychological, economic, guerrilla, and military means under political
                            direction at every stage and level. This is the essence of the new
                            Communist subversive warfare. Our counter-insurgency effort must, in my
                            judgment, be equally well-balanced and flexible otherwise we are likely
                            either to lose the fight or to throw this country into another
                            Korean-type war. Under present conditions, by setting up an area
                            military command here, I think we will not only risk poor coordination,
                            but we will almost inevitably build into our effort a disproportionate
                            emphasis, in resources and planning as well as appearance, on a military
                            solution to the problem of Viet Cong insurgency in VietNam. I am
                            profoundly convinced that the problem cannot be solved on a military
                            basis (although military force is an indispensable element), and I think
                            my military colleagues here agree with this, as do all members of our
                            task force.</p>
                        <p>My second point is related to the above. US efforts vis-à-vis the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> over many months have been in the
                            direction of encouraging and aiding them to take the offensive against
                            the Viet Cong in many fields, not alone in the military. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself has been inclined to put too
                            much emphasis upon military measures relative to civil measures. The
                            establishment of a US area military command here would, I am afraid,
                            encourage this tendency.</p>
                        <p>Broadly speaking, my view is that there should continue to be a unified
                            all-agency effort in this country (i.e. the task force concept)
                            supported and directed on a day to day basis by an all-agency
                            directorate in Washington. I believe a way can be found within this
                            framework to preserve a clear-cut military chain of command over US
                            operational units presently planned for Viet-Nam without establishing
                                <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0754"/>a military command
                            structure which would throw the total effort out of balance. Standby
                            plans for military operations and command should be made for instant use
                            in the event of escalation or a change in the nature of the present
                            war.</p>
                        <p>I am sure I do not need to add that my strong convictions expressed above
                            are based on what I consider to be the compelling interests of the
                            United States in this matter, and are not dictated by considerations of
                            a personal or jurisdictional nature.<note n="3" xml:id="d318fn3">In

                            discussed current Viet-Nam situation separately with British and
                            Australian Ambassadors. Major point emphasized to both mission chiefs
                            was that US believes concerted international non-military assistance to
                            Diem Government rather than sole US support highly desirable and hopes
                            other governments can be persuaded make meaningful contributions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> suggested
                            possibility assistance might be coordinated through existing
                            organization such as Colombo Plan if we found bilateral dealings
                            resulted in overlapping activity. While guardedly receptive idea of
                            concerted help to VietNam, both Ambassadors non-committal re specific
                            means coordination. Both undertook discuss with home governments.</p>
                        <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0755"/>
                        <p>British Ambassador concerned that US help to Diem not ignore Geneva
                            Accords since subsequent North Vietnamese compliance with Accords might
                            then undermine position of US and others helping Diem. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> revealed that in contemplated
                            exchange of notes between Diem and President, latter would make point
                            that new measures no longer necessary if North Viet-Nam adhered to
                            Accords. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stressed
                            necessity Russians and Chinese be aware Western determination prevent
                            Viet Cong victory but at same time allay suspicions, especially Chinese,
                            re ultimate US intentions.</p>
                        <p>Returning discussion concerted assistance, <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> noted possible provision Philippine medical
                            team, Malayan guerrilla instruction, <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> Mission, etc., either undertaken or under
                            consideration. Suggested other types help might include flood relief.
                            Stressed importance encourage other Asian support. British Ambassador
                            said British playing down <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> Mission since <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> “sold as Tunku’s man.” Added Tunku aware danger
                            posed in South Viet-Nam but suggested direct participation Malayan
                            personnel perhaps not politically possible for Tunku. <persName corresp="#p_OGD1">Ormsby-Gore</persName> said British opposed <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> participation. Re aid to Diem, British
                            have thought in bilateral rather than multilateral terms.</p>

                                specter of opening a “Pandora’s Box”.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>As you know, quite apart from whether Chinese are Communists or
                                Nationalists, prejudice against them is strong throughout Southeast
                                Asia, including VietNam, even though the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is apparently receptive to accepting some of them
                                in the present emergency.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>One of our objectives in Viet-Nam is to assist the Vietnamese to
                                counter successfully the Communist-directed insurgency without
                                attracting substantial <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                                intervention. The introduction of <gloss target="#t_ChiNats1">ChiNats</gloss> would certainly in some degree increase this
                                hazard.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>For the above reasons, I believe we should not introduce ChiNat forces
                            into Viet-Nam at this time but should continue to explore other
                            alternatives.</p>
                        <p>For instance, I believe we should closely examine whether interpreters
                            are indispensable. Experience in the police training programs in
                            VietNam, which may be similar to the individual and small unit training
                            required for the Self Defense Corps, indicates that interpreters are not
                            indispensable.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, we might examine the possibilities of getting experts from
                            Malaya, the Philippines or Thailand, who are experienced in this
                            work.</p>
                        <p>Another possibility might be to obtain a more precise estimate of the
                            nature and extent of the training required through the results of our
                            provincial survey teams, which are about to commence their
                            investigations. We may find that training and equipping the Self Defense
                            Corps should be done progressively in areas which become “white”,
                            closely following an integrated plan of clearing areas, setting up Civil
                            Guard units and <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> back-up for quick
                            reaction when the Self Defense Corps gives the alarm. An immediate
                            nationwide on-the-spot training in white, pink, or red areas may invite
                            serious trouble for the program.</p>
                        <p>Our relative success in Laos with Mobile Training Teams suggests the idea
                            of traveling teams to train, advise, and equip rather than “on-the-spot”
                            training by a large number of trainers scattered thinly in villages,
                            vulnerable to <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> attack.</p>
                        <p>The above thoughts are offered as possible alternatives which I believe
                            should be explored before we consider utilizing <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces. Of course, if Chinese Communist forces are
                            introduced into Viet-Nam this would substantially change the
                            situation.</p>

                            these defoliants of the 2-4D variety are not harmful to humans, animals,
                            or the soil. Since there are miles of jungle roads in Vietnam, U.S.
                            planes and personnel are actively cooperating in this jungle growth

                            clearing jungle growth along the sides of roads, that we are not
                            attacking any human targets, and that its primary purpose is to prevent
                            the guerrilla forces from utilizing this jungle cover for ambushing
                            Vietnamese forces.</p>
                        <p>We also anticipate that the ground work laid in connection with this
                            jungle road clearance operation will establish a framework within which
                            we can combat future Communist propaganda blasts for other phases of
                            defoliant operations, i.e., tactical <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">Zone

                        <p>On December 15, 1961, the White House released the texts of a letter from
                            President Diem to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, dated December 7, and a reply by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName>, dated December 14.
                            The text of Diem’s letter was substantially the same as the draft
                            contained in <ref target="#d257">Document 257</ref>. In his letter,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> said that the
                            American people were “deeply disturbed by the assault” on South Viet-Nam
                            and were prepared to help “protect its people and to preserve its
                            independence.” <persName corresp="#p_KJF1">Kennedy</persName> also told
                            Diem: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            stating that Diem planned to send the letter “soon”.</p>
                        <p>Fritz did not have a chance to do anything about this prior to his
                            departure for Honolulu. Accordingly, when I saw <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> on another matter this afternoon,
                            I took it on myself to mention the letter and to say with appropriate
                            expressions of difference that I felt bound to let him know as a friend
                            and on a strictly personal basis that I thought such a letter would be
                            badly received in Washington. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had obviously not seen or heard of the letter and
                            expressed considerable interest in it. (It is of course patently a Nhu
                            production.) I gave him a brief sketch of the contents, mentioning
                            particularly the references to the Civil Guard and to American domestic
                                politics.<note n="5" xml:id="d323fn5">Apparently a reference to
                                Diem’s contention in his letter that the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration’s failure to understand
                                properly the “phenomenon of modern underdevelopment” led to a
                                reduced role for the Civil Guard and his expression of gratitude to
                                “the new Democratic Administration for having better evaluated the
                                mission of the Civil Guard and for permitting it to be trained at
                                present by <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>.” Diem also stated
                                that the “chief reason for the long continued American refusal to
                                convert the Civil Guard into a real guerilla army is a certain
                                opinion to the effect that I entertained a sinister plan to create a
                                personal army with the American money.”</note> I said that, whatever
                            might be the validity of the statements regarding the Civil Guard, I
                            thought they would not be understood in Washington at a time when we had
                            embarked on a <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0760"/>greatly increased
                            effort to assist the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. The reference
                            to alleged policy differences between the Republican and Democratic
                            administrations was also not likely to be helpful to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, in my opinion. Finally, I repeated
                            that I had no wish to undermine my usefulness in VietNam, but I felt
                            obliged as a friend to indicate what I thought might be the Washington
                            reaction to such a communication. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> appeared to take this very well and gave me a most
                            friendly pat on the back as I departed. Whether he will be able to do
                            anything about the letter is another matter.</p>

                            Viet Cong had on balance become stronger or weaker since October 1; what
                            the forecast was for the next 90 and the next 180 days; (3) The major
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> weaknesses and what must be
                            corrected if the Viet Cong were to be defeated; (4) The status of plans
                            to achieve United States objectives in South Vietnam, including <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s concept of the campaign plan

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Cot:</hi> By the time you receive this letter
                            you will probably have received information on the Secretary of Defense
                            conference here last Saturday<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">December
                                16.</note> from one or more of the participants from Washington,
                            e.g., Bill Bundy, Joe Wellings, “Pickles” <persName corresp="#p_HRALC1">Heinz</persName>. If you can get a copy of the agenda which was
                            prepared at this headquarters, and of the record of the conference
                            prepared here,<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3">See <ref target="#d324">Document 324</ref>.</note> you will have a thorough coverage of
                            the topics discussed, decisions made, and actions to be taken. In your
                            capacity as Director of Task Force-Viet Nam I would think it important
                            for you to have access to these documents.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this letter is to sort out what seemed to me significant
                            aspects of the conference from the policy viewpoint. First I might say
                            that thanks to a great deal of hard and careful work by Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and members of his
                            staff the conference moved along rapidly, covering a great deal of
                            ground during the nine hours of meetings. As far as I know Washington
                            and Saigon participants, as well as those of us here, feel that the
                            conference was well worthwhile; it produced not only greater mutual
                            understanding of the problems facing us in South Viet Nam but also a
                            number of important decisions by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> brought a sense of immediacy to the
                            conference, emphasizing they wanted concrete actions that would begin to
                            show results in 30 days. They were not interested in projects to be
                            completed in 1963. The Secretary at the outset stressed that the primary
                            effort of the U.S. military establishment was behind South Viet Nam and
                            that we could have practically anything we wanted short of combat
                            troops. In closing the conference he said our job was to win in South
                            Viet Nam, and if we weren’t winning to tell him what was needed to win.
                            The Secretary was interested in specifics such as the number and types
                            of personnel, kinds and amounts of equipment, the costs and specific
                            plans to accomplish specific objectives. The Secretary clearly had
                            little faith in gimmicks such as defoliants. He was leery of
                            overemphasizing naval and air actions, although he recognized their
                            importance as <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0765"/>supporting
                            elements. He warned against the danger of sitting in Washington and
                            checking off lists of junks, aircraft delivered, etc., figuring we were
                            winning the war by this process.</p>
                        <p>During the course of a discussion on how to get Diem to follow U.S.
                            advice Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>
                            observed that we are unlikely to get Diem to carry out his recent
                            commitments to us to the degree or as rapidly as we would expect or
                            like. There would be no automatic fruition of these agreements from the
                            Vietnamese side. This is something we had to live with. The Secretary
                            commented that Diem was the only man we had, that he had some basis for
                            being suspicious because of all the coup talk, and that if we
                            concentrated on fundamental military specifics he thought we could get
                            Diem to cooperate. We had to work with him; we couldn’t expect to change
                            people. He felt that while reforms were necessary, they take a long time
                            and we need some specific action within the next 30 days. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> agreed with the
                            “specifics approach”, saying that we couldn’t remodel the overall
                            structure of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or change
                            characters.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary evinced strong interest in building up the Civil Guard and
                            self-defense corps. He reasoned that past experience has shown that
                            after the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> sweeps through an area
                            the Viet Cong filters back in and there is nothing to show for it. He
                            guaranteed the money and equipment to strengthen the Civil Guard
                            provided a specific plan was worked out. He suggested as a starter,
                            taking one province, doubling or tripling the Civil Guard as necessary,
                            sweeping the province with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> and
                            consolidating control with the Civil Guard. The Secretary did not object
                            to increasing the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ceiling above
                            200,000 provided good justification could be furnished him, but he
                            raised the question whether the resources couldn’t better be used to
                            increase the Civil Guard. He tended to brush aside Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName>’s worries about raising the
                            necessary piastres to meet the costs of expanding force levels.<note n="4" xml:id="d326fn4">This sentence is underlined on the source

                        <p>One subject on the agenda but not discussed in the meetings was command
                            relationships in the event U.S. forces Viet Nam (<gloss target="#t_USFV1">USFV</gloss>) were established. However,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> discussed this
                            subject with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_FAHD1">Felt</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> separately,
                            indicating his lack of agreement with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> concept. In
                            general his thinking coincided with that contained in the draft message
                            from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d326fn5">See
                                    <ref target="#d317">Document 317</ref>.</note> a copy of which
                            Joe Wellings had brought with him. <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> feels that the eradication of the Viet Cong is
                            not simply a military problem but one involving economic, <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0766"/>psychological, political and social
                            actions. Although in the next six months the military might need an
                            overriding priority, if ultimate success is to be obtained, there must
                            be a parallel action in these other fields. We must beef them up as we
                            are now beefing up the military. He also feels that creation of a <gloss target="#t_USFV1">USFV</gloss> command would encourage the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in its present tendency to
                            overemphasize military action and regard it as a cure-all. He fears,
                            too, that it would tempt the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to play
                            off the commander <gloss target="#t_USFV1">USFV</gloss> and the
                            Ambassador against each other. He therefore wants to stick to a task
                            force concept. As far as I am aware this is the only agenda subject upon
                            which there was a significant divergence of views between the Ambassador
                            and the military side.</p>
                        <p>There were three more subjects of broad policy interest which I will just
                            mention briefly: 1) U.S. transport aircraft such as the C-123’s and the
                            helicopter companies are being sent to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> for combat support activities, not for “taxi service.”
                            2) No seabee or Army Engineer battalions are to be used in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> for construction projects since use of
                            U.S. combat troops for their protection is ruled out at this time; use
                            civilian contractors instead. 3) U.S. manned ships or boats are not to
                            be used in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> inland waters despite the
                            apparent offer in paragraph 1(c) <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 619 to Saigon.<note n="6" xml:id="d326fn6">See <ref target="#d287fn2">footnote 2, Document 287</ref>.</note>
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> will have to
                            try to straighten this out with Diem.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is, of course, highly restricted information. Moreover, it
                            is frankly a subjective interpretation of what is important. I hope you
                            can see the “agenda” and the “record” for a complete fill in.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bob:</hi> There are two comments I should like
                            to make on your memorandum of December 18<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2"><ref target="#d327">Document 327</ref>.</note> about the
                            military organization in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>First, it was my recollection that you had agreed to the designation
                            suggested in my letter,<note n="3" xml:id="d328fn3">See <ref target="#d317">Document 317</ref>.</note> namely, “Commander,
                            U.S. Military Assistance Command—Vietnam.” The use of the term “forces:
                            gives the impression of organized military units considerably beyond
                            those we presently have in mind.</p>
                        <p>Second, in our talk today we did not get very far into the relationship
                            between our Ambassador and the U.S. Military Commander. I agree with
                            respect to the direct operational contact between the Commander and the
                            Vietnamese officials, including President Diem. I also agree that the
                            Ambassador and the Commander should keep each other fully informed. My
                            own view of the relations between the two is covered in the next to the
                            last paragraph of the letter I handed you in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps one of your colleagues could follow up on this with <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> in the event there are
                            any dangling points which need attention. Even though they might be
                            minor in the total context, there is great advantage in our having
                            complete clarity in the interest of harmonious and efficient operations
                            in the field.</p>

                            to have my further views following these conversations.</p>
                        <p>I am more convinced than ever that, in circumstances existing now in
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>, division of US authority and
                            responsibility would be a grave error and would jeopardize
                            accomplishment of US objectives. I agree in general with points made in
                            draft message from SecState to <gloss target="#t_SecDef1">SecDef</gloss>, but I do not think that draft is precise enough in
                            defining responsibilities and command and inter-agency relationships in
                            Viet Nam.</p>
                        <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0770"/>
                        <p>In considering how best to organize, we should realize that our
                            organizational arrangement will have a direct effect on: (a) What US
                            does; (b) What <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> does; and (c) What
                            the enemy does.</p>
                        <p>If we organize in manner proposed by Defense, we will, I think: (a) Put a
                            disproportionate emphasis, in planning and allocation of US resources
                            and manpower, on military means; (b) Encourage <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to do likewise and thus neglect other measures
                            essential to winning the allegiance of South Vietnamese people (there
                            has always existed a strong tendency in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> towards this error, e.g., recent demand for saturation
                            bombing); (c) Play into hands of enemy, who is organized differently,
                            for a different kind of war; or [(d)] Invite a military reaction from
                            outside.</p>
                        <p>While I welcome vigorous planning and action by Defense in this
                            situation, which was vividly demonstrated at recent Honolulu meeting,
                            and regard more effective military measures as having highest priority
                            in turning tide of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> insurgency, I do
                            not believe that US organizational arrangements should, or need, be
                            fundamentally changed to accommodate introduction of three to four
                            thousand additional US military personnel. On the contrary, I think task
                            force concept is still valid, needing only such modification as is
                            required to satisfy sound requirement that US operational units shall
                            have purely military chain of command. Vis-à-vis <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, however, there should clearly be one US spokesman in
                                <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>; otherwise we shall get the
                            run-around. This spokesman should be chairman and coordinator of US task
                            force as at present, but should not, of course, interfere in command of
                            US military forces.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I would envisage a top US military man here who would be a member
                            of our task force; who would have two deputies (one for military
                            assistance and advisory duties and the other for command of US
                            operational forces). The top military man would be responsible for
                            coordinating within the TF the military segment of the total US effort,
                            and thereafter he would be responsible for carrying it out through one
                            or the other of his two deputies. He would, of course, speak frequently
                            with President Diem and other high <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            officials as at present, in discharge of the military elements of the US
                            program. It should, however, be clearly understood that the chairman of
                            the US task force, i.e., the Ambassador, has the responsibility and
                            accompanying authority for the total US effort to sustain in Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>If this were an active theater of warfare in the traditional sense, with
                            US combat forces directly involved, the recommendation above would not
                            be made. The fact that we have not put combat forces into this country,
                            and intend to win without doing so, demonstrates to my mind that US
                            relationships with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and US
                            organizational arrangements, should clearly correspond to our stated
                            intention, <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0771"/>which is to help the
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> to mount effective
                            countermeasures in all fields to the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            insurgency. This is still essentially a political job in the broadest
                            sense, and should be organized and run as such.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary, I should like to add that, no matter what the command
                            arrangements, the vigor of the Dept of Defense in this situation needs
                            to be matched by equal vigor in the non-military aspects if the proper
                            proportions are to be maintained in our total effort here.</p>

                            Am also hopeful be given more reasonable advance notice on agenda.</p>

                            psychological reactions.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned in letter today,<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">Not
                                found.</note> consider it unfortunate that reorganization and

                            learned this item on agenda and was <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0772"/>appreciative of my superiors’ recognition that “man on
                            firing line” should be allowed to participate in these discussions.
                            Regret that circumstances did not permit. This naturally of extreme
                            importance to me both from operational and personal viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>Due greatly expanded mission here over and above normal <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> type operation, have long recognized
                            we doing job of small theatre headquarters with staff and authority for
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> Mission alone. Therefore, have
                            made number specific recommendations to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> over period of time which designed match resources
                            and terms of references with actual duties and responsibilities.
                            Meanwhile have accepted these additional duties, mainly by default, and
                            attempting discharge to best of capability. This currently made
                            additionally difficult by failure State get more than promise by Diem
                            nor “much closer relationship than the present one of acting in an

                        <p>On personal side, know you understand that particularly in dealing with
                            orientals, my value could be depreciated should a Senior man be brought
                            in to take over top spot. Such action could well react unfavorably on my

                                    <p>As agreed Honolulu meeting, I told <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> we did not see
                                        necessity of, and had decided against, sending US uniformed
                                        personnel to man small boats for inland waterway patrol (a
                                        point which was subject to misinterpretation in US
                                        negotiating instructions.) He understands our position, but
                                        was disappointed; said this would require additional <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> naval personnel and
                                        training in handling US-furnished boats. I said I thought
                                        that, along with the boats, we would consider
                                        sympathetically any necessary increase in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> naval personnel and
                                        training for them. He will send us a note with his specific
                                        ideas on this.</p>
                                    <p>On joint provincial surveys, we agreed that <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> would call first team

                                        stories (especially articles in two recent issues of Time),
                                        emphasizing “concessions” which US has, or should, extract

                                        in view of sensitivities and national pride involved. I told

                                        that they had not originated with us here; and that I had
                                        done everything that I could to prevent our recent
                                        discussions and agreements from being reflected in this

                                    matter. I had asked him direct question of when 5,000-man Ranger
                                    Striking Force for Border Patrol would be organized in order,
                                    among other things, to use our helicopters. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> had replied somewhat
                                    evasively to two direct questions on this. <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName> said that this would be
                                    done as agreed; but that it would be great help if Chief <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> could come up with a joint
                                    recommendation with <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> field
                                    command on Ranger units which could best be spared from present
                                    duties. If [He]could then, he felt persuade Diem to release
                                    them. General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>
                                    is working on this. I made it clear to <persName corresp="#p_NDT2">Thuan</persName>, and he understands that
                                    US cannot afford, in terms its own public opinion, to send to
                                    Viet-Nam supporting forces and material only to have them stand
                                    idle, waiting for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> plans and
                                    actions. I was frank in telling him that such a situation would
                                    soon reflect itself in US press and no doubt in congressional
                                    questions; and that we counted heavily on <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s recognition of this fact and

                            directly under field command. Minh explained purpose was to assist Corps
                            Commanders who are heavily involved in overall pacification their CTZ.
                            Task force needed conduct specific operations against heavy Viet Cong

                            close to brother Nhu approached Minh and asked why he wanted task
                            force-is it for purpose of a coup?</p>
                        <p>Minh also presented border control plan to Diem (which is basically
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> plan as modified by field
                            command) and was instructed to “hold off” as he now studying British

                        <p>As result, Minh states he feels like “officer without portfolio.” He

                        <p>You will recall discussing with a member of my staff the bearing on the
                            campaign in South Viet-Nam of Diem’s fear of a coup. In brief, Diem is
                            hobbling the ability of the armed forces to fight the Viet Cong in order
                            to minimize the chances of a coup against himself. He does this by a
                            variety of means including interference in the chain of command and
                            tight control of field units.</p>
                        <p>At the local level, counter-guerrilla operations require an extraordinary
                            degree of tactical initiative if units are to react fast to dangers and
                            to opportunities. This requires more decentralization than Diem allows.
                            At the national level, the Government is unlikely to make progress in
                            bringing the country under its control unless it follows an over-all
                            plan for doing so. This would seem to require, inter alia, unity of
                            command in respect of overall planning and general direction of
                            operations. But a unit commander is unlikely to obey the order of his
                            superiors in the chain of command if he anticipates other and different
                            orders from the Chief of State.</p>
                        <p>Diem’s practices, intended to guard him against a military coup, thus
                            help create frustrations driving the military to stage one. The vicious
                            circle needs to be broken. It could be broken by a successful coup
                            against Diem, but for us to encourage one would involve grave risks. The
                            alternative is to provide Diem with more personal security.</p>
                        <p>Diem’s sense of security would be promoted if the capital city area were
                            placed under the protection of units to be hand-picked by Diem himself,
                            with their officers subject only to his direction. We have broached this
                            idea to Cottrell who says <persName corresp="#p_TRGK1">Thompson</persName> has already suggested this to Diem who likes
                            it, but that our military are <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0778"/>horrified. This seems to be a situation, however, in which political
                            considerations are clearly overriding.</p>

                                approach to Diem, possibly in company, to attempt to overcome Diem’s
                                objection to our plan. It should be explained to Diem that the plan
                                and command arrangements therein were designed by me to fulfill
                                requirements for efficient control of military operations. He should
                                be reassured in most earnest terms that we have no motive other than
                                to counsel a military campaign plan and control arrangements
                                therefore designed to attain the objective of mutual interest to his
                                government and ours to lick the Viet Cong.</item>

                                selling Diem on a campaign plan that puts mobile, hard-hitting
                                forces, efficiently organized and commanded, against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> at proper time and place. Concerning

                                cannot overemphasize the necessity for personal contact and
                                discussion- with Diem in lieu of letters or memoranda. <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0780"/>I have distinct impression that at
                                times the written word is misinterpreted and takes on erroneous

                                primarily on personal discussion attempting to insure that Diem and

                                meeting 16 Dec desirability of getting on with a smaller, more
                                readily-accomplished operation was emphasized because of possible
                                delay in developing and implementing <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> version of <gloss target="#t_ref1">ref</gloss> A.
                                There is vital need for early <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                                victory, both for military and psychological reasons. Therefore,
                                while continuing to press for our campaign plan and for <gloss target="#t_ZoneD1">zone D</gloss> operations, we should devote
                                immediate effort toward mounting a smaller operation that has a
                                chance for early success and will contribute to zone “D” problem.
                                Further, that for such operation a single province should be
                                selected for clearing and holding. Plan should not be developed on
                                basis that operations will depend on defoliation. Further, zone “D”
                                plan itself should be modified to de-emphasize reliance on

                            proposed reorganization and ultimate command arrangements which you
                            raise in your Eyes Only message (<gloss target="#t_SGN1">SGN</gloss>

                            have been devoting much personal attention here.</p>
                        <p>2. I had planned to have a few moments with you alone after the 16
                            December meeting to discuss the question with you, but as you know, our
                            party left almost immediately for take-off and there was no possibility
                            for such a get-together.</p>
                        <p>3. Although the subject was listed in our agenda for the 16 December
                            meeting, it was passed over without discussion because the Secretary of
                            Defense and the Secretary of State had already initiated joint
                            consideration of the problem here in Washington and had agreed that they
                            personally (and not their staffs) would work out a final recommendation
                            for submission to the President. Therefore, as you noted at the meeting,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> simply
                            skipped the item when we came to it on the agenda. Near the end of the
                            meeting Amb Nolting handed me a note to pass to Secy <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in which he said he would
                            like to discuss the subject personally with Sec Def after the meeting.
                            Sec Def agreed although it was his intention not to discuss it with
                            anyone at Honolulu. From what Sec Def told me I gather that they did in
                            fact have a brief discussion on the subject of proposed organizational
                            changes. I understand that Amb Nolting asked Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> what his and other thinking
                            in Washington was in this regard and Sec Def gave him his general views.
                            From information available to me they did not have a meeting of minds on
                            the subject. (Note: Foregoing is for your eyes only and should not be
                            revealed to any other person.)</p>
                        <p>4. I would like to give some flavor of my personal thinking and of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views on this sensitive question. We
                            have been completely satisfied with the manner in which you have
                            discharged your duties out there and we have consistently made this
                            point in interdepartmental discussions here. With the decision not to
                            introduce combat troops into Viet-Nam we have had serious doubts about
                            the desirability of a fundamental change in the U.S. organization there.
                            In view of information we had regarding thinking at higher levels in
                            U.S. Govt, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> response to a request
                            for recommendations for a new U.S. command structure in Viet-Nam is
                            qualified by the words “if it is decided to change the command structure
                            in Vietnam.” Nevertheless although final decision has not yet been made
                            by the President it now appears that a change in U.S. organization will
                            be made. The primary object of the change is to impress Diem that we are
                            entering a new era in U.S.-Vietnamese relationships in which the U.S.
                            will be giving him increased support and be expecting him to pay
                            increased heed to our advice and suggestions. Generally speaking, the
                            new terms of reference will provide for a U.S. military assistance
                            command, rather than an advisory group, and will insure that the senior
                            U.S. military representative in Viet-Nam has the <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0782"/>controlling voice, both on the U.S.
                            side and with Viet-Nam officials, on military matters. Another factor
                            which is involved is the possibility of broadening whatever organization
                            is decided for Viet-Nam into a U.S. military organization for all of SE
                            Asia, and possibly ultimately expanding into a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> command if the situation continues to deteriorate in
                            Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.</p>
                        <p>5. Also, for the purpose of increasing the impact on Diem that the U.S.
                            looks to a new and increased counter-insurgency effort on his part, it
                            now appears that a four-star U.S. commander will be named to operate
                            under the new terms of reference and that you and your <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will come under his over-all command.
                            I fully appreciate what your feelings may be if this proposal is
                            implemented. That is why I want personally to emphasize to you that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and I have complete confidence
                            in you and have been thoroughly satisfied with the results you have
                            achieved in the face of great handicaps, obstacles and frustrations.
                            From my conversations with Adm Felt I am convinced he feels the same
                            way. We recognize the burden of personal adjustment necessary to fit
                            into the new command structure, if and when it is created, but are
                            certain that you will take this in your stride, as you have so many
                            other difficulties during your fifteen months in Saigon. I know you’ll
                            appreciate that the new man will have to lean heavily on you and will
                            need every bit of help he can get from you.</p>
                        <p>6. I will keep you further informed as developments take place here. All
                            of this, I know, adds up to something less than a Christmas present for
                            you, but you are too good a soldier to let it bother you for long.
                            Therefore I’ll close with a personal expression of the Season’s
                            Greetings for you and the members of your command and the hope that the
                            New Year in Viet-Nam will see the results of some of the training and
                            planning you have so patiently and thoroughly accomplished during 1960
                            [1961].</p>

                            <item>Foremost, if not most important is, of course, the question of
                                unauthorized “leaks” in Washington. I am assuming that the leaks are
                                not authorized-that some individuals are simply talking too much. It
                                may well be that the Department of State feels it is important to
                                broach certain ideas to the American people, but it would be most
                                helpful if they would notify us too. My own feeling of course is
                                that we should go as far as possible with the press both here and in
                                Washington on an agree-upon basis-within the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> limitations. It would seem to me most appropriate
                                to go back to what was laid down in the original guidance cables and
                                work up from there on a “non-attributable” basis. We should be able
                                to deal with almost any subject that comes along if we all observe
                                those clearly stated principles.</item>

                            <item><p>Although I can describe ideas as to what <gloss target="#t_USIS1">USIS</gloss> can do in the present
                                    situation in VietNam, I think some exploration along those lines
                                    with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> would be
                                    helpful. For example, there is much that needs to be done for
                                    and with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> which basically
                                    lies in the <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> bailiwick.
                                    However, the fact of the matter is-and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> would be the first to admit it-that the
                                    talents are not always available there. We are solving part of
                                    the problem through the Psychological Operations Committee, of
                                    course. But I am concerned that effective
                                    psychological/information operations (as part of the war effort)
                                    require more and closer professional advisory assistance to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> at a coordinated
                                    Presidency level. I am thinking also in terms of provincial
                                    “information officers” who might pass as administrative advisors
                                    to provincial councils, let us say, or even as teachers.
                                    Ordinarily <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> would provide
                                    such personnel, I presume, but I am not sure that <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> is prepared to do so. On the
                                    other hand, the kind of people we need are those who are
                                    ordinarily allied with <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>.
                                    Perhaps of Peace Corps type technicians, under <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0784"/>whatever name (IVS, for
                                    example), might suggest how we can put our talents and our
                                    resources together in terms of field operations, as well as
                                    professional advisory assistance at the Saigon level.</p>
                                <p>In this connexion, I talked with the British Counselor (J.A.
                                    Burrows) today about just such matters. As an old <gloss target="#t_BIS1">BIS</gloss> hand, he is not only interested
                                    but anxious to contribute <gloss target="#t_BIS1">BIS</gloss>
                                    help wherever possible, with our concurrence. He is drafting a
                                    letter to the <gloss target="#t_FO1">FO</gloss> about the
                                    critical weaknesses in the information/propaganda effort,
                                    suggesting that his people and ours (such as <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Ed Murrow</persName>) consider this as
                                    seriously as we do and prepare to do something about it. A
                                    sample proposal: a week-long <persName corresp="#p_MER1">Murrow</persName> visit here to “survey” the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>’s needs and offer ideas to
                                    satisfy them, such as an advisor to the “program planning board”
                                    at the Presidency referred to earlier, and professional
                                    personnel to advise (if not do) in the provinces. According to
                                    Burrows, the British might be in a position to help in this, …,
                                    when it’s operational.</p>

                                    appropriate context in which to inject my comments, albeit
                                    belatedly:</p>
                                <p>It seems to me we are extending ourselves in the interest of the
                                        <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> into an area of
                                    complaint and protest against activities in the U.S. over which
                                    we have always maintained we have no control, and little
                                    influence. Would it not seem more logical for the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Ambassador in Washington to
                                    raise such issues, rather we [than us?]? This could apply
                                    equally to the <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcast,
                                    although the question of “control” obviously does not apply in
                                    the same way here. My own impression is that by eliminating
                                    brief news reports of events which are likely to attract both
                                    U.S. and foreign attention anyway, <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> would find it almost impossible to maintain its
                                    role as a news medium, especially for those populations cut off,
                                    for one reason or another, from normal mass media
                                    communications.</p>
                                <p>We appear to be in danger of getting caught in the web of
                                    somewhat conflicting principles. We cannot do more with the
                                    image of the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> than is made
                                    available by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> itself; in
                                    other words, unless we rely on distortion, whatever we mirror
                                    will be a reflection of the face the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> presents to the world. I would imagine that
                                    this conviction has prompted <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>’s suggestion that we take up the censorship
                                    question with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> for the
                                    umpteenth time. If we were to do this while at the same time we
                                    are more or less assuring the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> that the U.S. will try to “discourage” some <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0785"/>elements of the
                                    American press, it seems to me we would appear to be talking out
                                    of both sides of our mouths at the same time. I don’t mind
                                    trying to discourage Newsweek, for example, but I don’t think we
                                    need to put ourselves in this position, more or less, with
                                    various <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> officials.</p>

                                the development of more and better communications with the village
                                populations. TV seems, at first glance, to be an ideal way of doing
                                this but the logistic and technical problems, if not the financial
                                factor, justifiably suggest postponement of such a project. Since
                                the need still exists, however, it would seem logical to press
                                forward urgently with the proposed alternative calling for the
                                distribution of 16mm film projectors and screens in those areas
                                where the communication problem is most critical. I should like to
                                add that at some date in the future, when the existing problems re
                                TV can be solved, it would still appear to me, as it does now in
                                principle, as a most effective communications technique.</item>

                            Diem giving control authority to Big Minh as his military field
                            commander, when Diem is apprehensive of a coup. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> then solicited your help to get
                            State to direct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_NFE1">Nolting</persName> to make a concerted approach to Diem with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>’s proposal, as in other
                            comments on this problem, I have yet to note anyone come up with an
                            answer to Diem’s apprehension. It is the basis for his real reluctance
                            to do what the Americans want him to do, and this basic point needs
                            resolving. How are <persName>Nolting</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName> to reassure him on this
                            point?</p>
                        <p>U.S. policy is to support Diem and he has been so informed by the
                            President. We know that Big Minh has been outspoken about a coup. Diem
                            certainly knows about the way Big Minh has been talking, also. Now we
                            ask Diem to give practical control of his military force to a man who
                            has talked about a coup. What realistic assurances can we give Diem that
                            the action he fears won’t take place?</p>
                        <p>It would seem that the increased U.S. military stake in Viet-Nam should

                            situation in a basically conventional manner. Demand for speed of

                            strong demand for equally important political-economic-psychological
                            advances largely forces unilateral military action which will not give
                            permanent results and which will prove counter productive. Permanent
                            results require long range coordinated action on all fronts and defeat

                        <p>However, decision to form a higher level command structure as a means of

                        <p>I notice with some alarm that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> does not seem to have a personal judgment of
                            General Harkins. I myself think it would be little more than a lucky
                            accident if in fact the officer designated for <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> duty some months ago should be just the right man for
                            the extraordinarily difficult job in Vietnam. Moreover, it is my strong
                            impression that the Joint Chiefs have wanted a 4-star officer because
                            this gives them an unembarrassing way of relieving General <persName corresp="#p_MGLGLC1">McGarr</persName>. This desire to avoid
                            embarrassment automatically limits to a very small number of officers
                            the possible choice of a commander.</p>
                        <p>I have repeatedly heard it said, by General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, by the civilian staff at the Pentagon, and by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> himself that
                            the only way of getting a really new look in the Army is to reach into
                            the age group of men between 35 and 45. This recommendation moves in the
                            opposite direction.</p>
                        <p>I wonder if it would not be wise for you or Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, or perhaps both, to have a
                            careful talk with Harkins, before this appointment is made. The history
                            of our affairs in the Far East-Stilwell and Wedemeyer in China, Walker
                            in Korea, <persName>McGarr</persName> in Vietnam, suggests that it is a
                            matter of critical importance to get the right man on the first try in
                            cases like this one.</p>
