                            payments and has neither the intention nor competence to deal with the
                            question of distribution. Belief that broadest interests of U. S.
                            Government are best protected by refraining at this time from
                            interjecting U. S. claims into the discussion of the committees of

                            and financial phases of the problem by the committees of experts.

                            that legal position of United States is based upon Armistice, Treaty of
                            Versailles, resolution of Congress approved July 2, 1921, and treaty of
                            August 25, 1921, with Germany. Concurrence with suggestion that legal
                            rights should be stressed and appearance of resting case wholly on
                            equitable grounds be avoided.</cell>

                            21 (text printed) protesting against the rumored project of a law

                            had not made special arrangements with Rumanian debtors similar to the

                            would, in some measure, continue to be made. A moratorium was thought of
                            only in connection with a loan or anticipatory payments by Germany and
                            in those circumstances the Allies undertook to communicate with this

                            cause any prejudice to the Government of the United States. If now a
                            moratorium is recommended, and if current army costs are exempted from
                            it, an arrangement should also be made for excepting a certain definite
                            amount as an annual payment on account of American Army costs, say a
                            twelfth of the total under the agreement of May 25. The equity of the

                            12 years in settlement of its just and overdue Army cost claim, whereas
                            Army costs of the Allies have been met practically in full as they fell

                            of Versailles. While adjudication of claims by the commission is
                            pending, it is impossible to determine accurately what the amount
                            finally awarded will be. This amount is, however, estimated at
                            approximately $500,000,000 exclusive of Army costs which were, for
                            certain technical reasons, notified to the commission. It should be
                            borne in mind in connection with the total amount of American claims
                            that the Government of the United States did not present any claims
                            included in the categories which are covered by paragraphs 5, 6 and 7,
                            annex I of part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles. Had this Government
                            followed the example of some of the other Allied and Associated Powers
                            and included these categories, the total amount of American claims would
                            have been greatly increased.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States considers that it is entitled to
                            compensation for this $500,000,000 or whatever other amount the Mixed
                            Claims Commission may finally determine.</p>
                        <p>Unless the attention of the first committee is called to the American
                            claims, it is not improbable that this committee’s recommendation will
                            provide for the utilization of all Germany’s available assets in
                            compensation of claims of other Allied and Associated Powers without
                            taking into consideration the claims of this Government. You should

                        <p>93. L–100, from Logan. Your telegram L–50, February 23, 5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>(1) I have ascertained that the experts’ committee is to deal with the
                            manner and the amount of payments Germany is to make beginning 1924, and
                            that it has neither intention nor competence to deal with the question
                            of distribution.</p>
                        <p>(2) In regard to our Army costs it should be borne in mind that under a
                            short moratorium on cash payments no amounts would accrue to us under
                            the agreement of May 25, 1923, during that period. The amounts deferred,
                            however, would be allocated, under the agreement, to the last eight
                            years daring which we have an absolute priority on all cash received
                            instead of only 25 percent. Purpose of any moratorium is to increase
                            cash payments in following years, so that actually under a cash
                            moratorium we are technically and practically more likely to be paid in
                            full than without a moratorium.</p>
                        <p>Your second paragraph. I do not understand that by our arms and
                            ammunition costs agreement the Allies bound themselves in any way not to
                            grant Germany a moratorium if the necessity arose. I fear that were we
                            to demand a cash payment of one-twelfth of the capital sum of the Army
                            costs during the moratorium period, we would not only confuse adjustment
                            but would greatly prejudice our own equity in the settlement. Under the
                            present plan of the experts’ committee, Germany will be asked to make
                            substantial deliveries in kind during moratorium period which are to be
                            financed, probably, by a loan largely internal. If Germany is also
                            called upon to make cash payments for our Army costs the moratorium
                            becomes a fiction.</p>
                        <p>The committee wishes for technical reasons to avoid use of the word
                            moratorium. A claim on our part for any cash payments would lead,
                            probably, to other claims by Allies for similar payments and undoubtedly
                            would have a disastrous effect on the ratification of agreement of May
                            25, now pending in the French Parliament.</p>
                        <p>(3) In regard to the claims before the Mixed Claims Commission, I am
                            convinced that the committee’s plan, as at present conceived, has no
                            direct bearing on the legal rights of the United States. It is my
                            personal belief that our legal rights will not be prejudiced by the
                            proposal any more than by the schedule of payments, or by any other
                            suggestions that might be made by the signatories of the Treaty of
                            Versailles who endeavor, naturally, to get all they can out <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0098"/>of Germany. Even so, the reservation
                            indicated in the paragraph (4) below could be framed in such a way by
                            the Department that our position would be protected from any possible
                            prejudice.</p>
                        <p>(4) For the reasons stated above and in view of the special position of
                            the Government of the United States on the question at issue, due to its
                            unofficial connection with the Separation Commission, it is my belief
                            that the broadest interests of our Government are best protected by
                            refraining at this time from interjecting the claims mentioned by the
                            Department into the discussion now under way in the two committees of
                            experts appointed by the Separation Commission, and that American
                            interests will be best served by encouraging in every way we can the
                            reaching of a solution of the economic and financial phases of the
                            problem by the experts’ committees and the commission, and if, and when,
                            the Reparation Commission takes definite decisions on the reports of the
                            two committees, and if then there is any question that the equitable
                            rights of the United States have been infringed, I am in a position,
                            should the Department so instruct me, to make a statement of record or a
                            reservation which will adequately protect our position. I feel that
                            after the Army Costs Agreement becomes effective through its
                            ratification by the French Parliament, our position is amply safeguarded
                            for the reasons stated under (2). So far as adjustment of our claims
                            resulting from operation of Mixed Claims Commission is concerned, should
                            we not elect to deal directly with Germany, settlement [is always
                            possible?] through medium of value of German property at present
                            sequestered by our [Government?]. [Always possible?] to negotiate with
                            Allies in hope of reaching some agreement in regard to participation on
                            percentage basis in annual cash payments hereafter to be made by Germany
                            under plan of the committees as at present conceived.</p>
                        <p>(5) I consider it highly inopportune at present to press the Allies to
                            arrange an adjustment with Germany giving specific mention and space to
                            our claims, as I feel certain that such a request at this moment and in
                            the particularly delicate situation existing would jeopard the hope of
                            constructive work following the experts’ work. There would be many,
                            indeed, who would say that the real object of American participation in
                            the experts’ committees, even in the present indirect and entirely
                            unofficial way, was the hope of slipping through the American claim and
                            in this way forcing the consent and cooperation of the Allies. Aside
                            from good ground of this argument, the purely technical aspect of which
                            I ignore, a much more acute danger from practical business point of view
                            would be raised by failure of the committees to reach constructive
                            findings than would be presented by some possible technical prejudicing
                            of American equity in the two categories of claims to which Department
                            refers in its instruction. We have claims against Europe <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0099"/>much more important than those of the
                            Army costs and the findings of the Mixed Claims Commission; namely,
                            Europe’s indebtedness to us. Our best hope for reimbursement of this
                            latter account depends upon Europe’s early rehabilitation and
                            reconstruction, and at least for the present this is largely dependent
                            on successful issue of the work of the committees. I should be alarmed,
                            therefore, were we virtually to throw away all chance of successful
                            results by pressing claims in question before experts’ committees.</p>
                        <p>(6) I shall not press views expressed in your telegram L–50 upon Dawes
                            and Young unless instructed to do so. Logan.</p>

                        <p>77. L–56, for Logan. Your L–100, February 28, 6 p.m. The statements made
                            in (1) and (2) of your telegram have been carefully noted. It does not
                            appear, however, why the cash payment of American Army costs would make
                            a moratorium any more of a fiction than would the payment of Allied Army
                            costs in cash, nor would it appear to be fair to give preferred
                            treatment during the moratorium to the Allied Army costs at expense of
                            our overdue and unpaid Army costs. To be assured of full payment over
                            the last 8 of the 12 years is one thing; it is quite another if the Army
                            Costs Agreement should be made abortive by reason of any plan the
                            experts submit. This was the reason why the Department believed that
                            General Dawes and Mr. Owen Young should be advised of our Army cost plan
                            and of the provisions of the agreement of May 25, 1923.</p>
                        <p>From communications received including Arthur Young’s personal letter of
                            January 24 to Mr. Hughes,<note n="10" xml:id="d3fn10">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> it appeared to the Department that the
                            committee’s report might contain recommendations for utilization of all
                            of Germany’s assets in settlement of Allied claims. Department believed
                            that Dawes and Owen Young should be informed that solid American claims
                            against Germany exist. The Department did not intend to demand an
                            immediate adjustment of its claims against Germany, nor did it wish to
                            countenance any action bearing on its claims which would prejudice its
                            ultimate interests. The Department agrees with you that the needless
                            injection of this issue into the deliberations of the committee would
                            not <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0100"/>serve any useful purpose. The
                            Department still believes, however, that Dawes and Owen Young should be
                            acquainted with the claims in question in order that they may be on
                            their guard against recommendations which might constitute in fact an
                            estoppal of the proper collection of this Government’s claims against
                            Germany. If the recommendations of the committee will not prejudice our
                            rights in any way with respect to payment by Germany of claims
                            adjudicated by the Mixed Claims Commission it will not, of course, be
                            necessary for Dawes and Owen Young to raise the question. The Department
                            has noted your statement that recommendations of the committee will not
                            take into consideration question of distribution of the payments to be
                            made by Germany, and has also noted your further statement that you
                            could take appropriate action to safeguard our rights if and when the
                            Separation Commission renders definite decisions upon the reports of the
                            committees. It may be true that the experts are not authorized to
                            distribute payments, but it is not impossible, for instance, that they
                            may in their recommendations look to the creation of certain credits to
                            be made available to the interested powers through central bank or by
                            other means which would cover all of Germany’s available assets; or,
                            after certain fixed charges have been determined, the plan may provide
                            for surplus to be allocated among certain creditor powers on percentage
                            basis which would exclude, in fact, this Government from participation.
                            Percentage basis, even if not explicit or stated in plan, may be assumed
                            in discussions. Such an arrangement might be a controlling factor in
                            eventual acceptance or rejection of the experts’ plan either by
                            Separation Commission or by the Allied Powers, and it would be most
                            embarrassing should it become necessary, in order properly to protect
                            our legitimate interests, to raise an objection at that late hour which
                            might afford excuse for other objections and result in either
                            embarrassment or defeat of the plan. To include at this time some
                            provision under which the door to participation by this Government would
                            not be definitely closed would obviate any necessity for objection or
                            reservation on its part; for example, it might be provided that any
                            credits or surplus made available should be distributed among the powers
                            that have claims against Germany.</p>
                        <p>Department has no desire at this particular juncture to jeopard
                            constructive results of the committees’ work by insisting on Allies
                            arranging adjustment with Germany which would give our claims specific
                            mention and place. On the other hand, it is important that American
                            interests should not be overlooked and that no final action be taken by
                            which Army Costs Agreement would be rendered nugatory, or which would
                            make it impossible to arrange, should it be necessary to do so, for
                            appropriate payment by Germany of claims adjudicated by Mixed Claims
                            Commission. American claims are not <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0101"/>large and this Government has already foregone categories upon which
                            other Powers have insisted.</p>
                        <p>Please advise Dawes and Owen Young of Department’s views.</p>

                            <item>I had already shown your L–50, February 23, 5 p.m., to Dawes and
                                Owen Young, and have informally handed them text of this telegram as
                                well as the other correspondence which completely informs them of
                                Department’s views.</item>

                            <item>I was hesitant about pressing too strongly the official views of
                                the Department because of the delicate and special position of Dawes
                                and Young on the investigation committee, as such action might have
                                been susceptible of interpretation that the American members of the
                                committee were in fact official agents of the Department. I have
                                explained fully that I was only communicating the Department’s views
                                for their information and that these views were in no sense of the
                                word instructions. Both Dawes and Young are aware of the views and
                                position of our Government; and it has already been kept in mind
                                that every effort would be made in a proper way to describe the
                                external war obligations of Germany to which any budgetary surplus
                                will be applicable in such elastic language as, while not
                                specifically including claim of the United States, would not
                                specifically exclude our claim. It is clear from my recent informal
                                conversations with General Dawes and Mr. Young that they have the
                                Department’s special interest in mind, and that in drafting of final
                                report of the committee, which is just now tinder way, they will
                                endeavor, by all means they can properly employ, to have such
                                language used as will protect position of the United States.</item>

                            <item>If, as I now feel to be unlikely, there is no success in obtaining
                                a favorable or noncommittal drafting, the Government of the United
                                States might make reservations along lines suggested under (4) of my
                                L–100, February 28, 6 p.m., when committee’s report is acted on by
                                Reparation Commission. It is now planned that the report will come
                                before the commission about March 19; in the mean <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0102"/>time the Department may desire to
                                consider nature and language of reservation if the necessity for it
                                should arise.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>While I fully appreciate the Department’s position in this
                                question, I feel forced, nevertheless, to adhere to my view already
                                expressed that the Government of the United States will be most
                                likely to obtain actual satisfaction of its two classes of claims if
                                the plan of experts goes through even in the contingency, now
                                somewhat remote, that the plan appears by its terms to deal with
                                Allied obligations only. Furthermore, inasmuch as United States is
                                not represented officially on the Reparation Commission, I am forced
                                to the conviction that no action taken by the committee can bind us
                                or stop us either in law or equity, and that our technical and legal
                                position remains unchanged from what it was before the committee
                                met. This will be true especially if we were to make full reserves
                                at appropriate time in regard to our rights should language of the
                                report appear to commit us adversely. I hope that Dawes and Young
                                will succeed in obtaining noncommittal wording which will render
                                unnecessary any reservation, as the moral effect of reservation on
                                our part might be harmful here. Logan.</item>

                        <p>91. L–58, for Logan. Your L–105, March 12. The Department hardly needs
                            emphasize earnest desire that work of the expert committees should be
                            successful and that no disposition exists here to cause slightest
                            embarrassment. The point of Department’s L–50, February 23, and L–56,
                            March 7, was, on the contrary, to avoid embarrassment and difficulties
                            which would arise were report of the committees to contain provisions or
                            to proceed upon understanding which would jeopard the just claims of
                            this Government and of its nationals. There is no lack of appreciation
                            of importance of European recuperation or of our own interest therein,
                            and we are fully sensible of difficulties of work of the committees and
                            skill and resourcefulness which have been shown by American experts. The
                            Department does not perceive that appropriate recognition of the
                            relatively small American claims would jeopard their work. The President
                            expects our claims to be properly safeguarded and if the event proved to
                            the contrary there would be an unfortunate reaction in American opinion
                            which would undoubtedly find effective expression in Congress.</p>

                        <p>When the nature of our claims is considered, this position becomes
                            clearer: <list>

                                <item>The Army costs claim, in relation to the Allies, is a debt of
                                    honor. At their request we maintained our Army in Europe, and
                                    did so under the distinct agreement that the claim for Army
                                    costs was to be paid on a parity with their own and ahead of
                                    reparations. They should have distributed equitably the money
                                    received for Army costs; instead of doing so they kept these
                                    moneys and left us out. We have had no desire to take advantage
                                    of their necessities, but we do wish to have an honorable
                                    obligation recognized and to this end we made an equitable
                                    agreement for the payment of our accumulated Army costs over a
                                    period of years. To render our Army Costs Agreement abortive and
                                    virtually to push aside our claim would be regarded here as most
                                    unjustifiable. It is not the point whether we would be
                                    technically or legally bound by an arrangement to which we were
                                    not a party. We wish to avoid the necessity of making
                                    representations on technical or legal grounds after the experts
                                    have gone through the great trouble of endeavoring to effect an
                                    arrangement which would permit economic recovery, and we do not
                                    wish to be put in position of seeming to obstruct the result of
                                    their efforts. The way to avoid this contingency is not to rely
                                    on technical grounds, but to have equitable and practical
                                    treatment of situation so as to prevent contingency.</item>

                                <item>In regard to our other claims, which are now under
                                    consideration by Mixed Claims Commission, this Government is not
                                    asking for priority or inequitable advantage, nor is it assuming
                                    a harsh and inconsiderate position. It simply desires reasonable
                                    and equal treatment. This Government’s claims are not large and
                                    it has abandoned categories upon which the Allies insist and
                                    upon which this Government was equally entitled to insist. Here
                                    again we wish to avoid creating difficulties arising from any
                                    disregard of our equities. The Department trusts that no
                                    occasion will arise which will require it to make any protest
                                    against a report for the success of which in the interests of
                                    peace and stability we are most anxious.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If the nature of the report, however, or any understandings which
                            accompany it, or the action of the Reparation Commission should be such
                            as to embarrass this Government in the protection of American claims,
                            either its own or those of its nationals, you are instructed to make
                            appropriate reservations before the commission. To advise you on the
                            exact terms of the reservation is almost impossible for us, having in
                            mind a contingency which we hope will be remote and without such a
                            report before us. Any reservation should, however, be comprehensive and
                            appropriate to the two classes of claims; it should set forth the
                            reserve of the Government of the United <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0104"/>States in regard to its rights as well as the
                            expression of its confidence that no action is thought of which would
                            ignore our part in the common victory over the enemy, or which would
                            preclude this Government from obtaining equitable treatment as above
                            stated with regard to the payment of the above claims.</p>

                            are completely informed of the Department’s views. I have had the
                            opportunity within the last few days of making an informal and hasty
                            examination of the draft report of the second committee, and noted in it
                            that, while our Army cost position had been protected, our Mixed Claims

                            copies to Dawes and Robinson: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    for a contention that the Government of the United States may,

                                    working of the plan, and I should consider it a much happier
                                    solution could the wording be so changed that it would leave
                                    these points unprejudiced.</p>
                                <p>From my hasty reading of the draft, I note that you have in mind
                                    making specific reference to American Army costs. To do so is
                                    very helpful as far as it goes, but the equally if not more
                                    important claim arising from the judgments of the Mixed Claims
                                    Commission is not covered. Strictly speaking, these awards of
                                    damages are perhaps not reparations, neither are they, according
                                    to contentions that might be made, charges under the Treaty of
                                    Versailles. Unless, however, we refer specifically to the
                                    satisfaction of these judgments or employ <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0105"/>alL–inclusive language, it is
                                    clear that the contention might well be maintained that none of
                                    the payments foreseen by the plan could properly be participated
                                    in for settlement of these judgments.”</p>

                        <p>Both General Dawes and Mr. Young are doing everything possible to meet
                            the views of the Department. Their position is, however, delicate. They
                            advise me informally that while there is no opposition to inclusion of
                            provision for Army costs claim in findings of the committee, there is,
                            nevertheless, strong opposition manifested to a provision for meeting
                            judgments of Mixed Claims Commission, the general feeling being that our
                            equity on that account is secured and our position protected by German
                            holdings of our Alien Property Custodian. Dawes and Young are both
                            working on the matter; but for reasons stated above, and provided I do
                            not have time to refer matter to Department, I may be forced to
                            formulate and make reservation outlined in paragraph (2), Department’s

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour, under instructions from
                            His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to
                            inform you that the reports of the Expert Committees of the Reparation
                            Commission which have, as you are aware, been made public during the
                            last few days, have in accordance with the usual custom been laid
                            before; the British Parliament. His Majesty’s Government anticipate that
                            before the Easter recess they will be called upon to make to Parliament
                            a statement of their views on these Reports, and it is their desire that
                            the Governments severally concerned should be made acquainted beforehand
                            with their attitude.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances I have the honour to inform you that at an early
                            date the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs intends to express the
                            satisfaction felt by His Majesty’s Government that the report is
                            unanimous, and that it has been signed by representative experts from
                            the United States, France, Italy and Belgium, as well as from Great
                            Britain. He will say that His Majesty’s Government feel that a report,
                            supported by such authority, must command general assent, and that there
                            will be a universal desire to use the <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0106"/>opportunity, afforded by so authoritative a report, to
                            end the unsettlement which now exists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ramsay MacDonald will then point to one feature which His Majesty’s
                            Government consider deserves special emphasis, namely, that it is boldly
                            stated in the report that it is an indivisible whole, and that the
                            signatories of the report renounce in the strongest terms all
                            responsibility therefor, if certain of their recommendations are
                            adopted, and others rejected. While therefore in some respects the
                            proposals may be capable of improvement, His Majesty’s Government attach
                            so much importance to the agreed recommendations, which can be brought
                            into immediate operation, that they for their part will be prepared to
                            support the scheme in its entirety, provided that all the other parties
                            concerned are willing to take the same course, agreeing to give the
                            experiment a real chance and waiting to make any modifications which may
                            appear necessary, until experience has been acquired and then only by
                            common agreement.</p>
                        <p>In communicating to you this brief summary of the attitude of His
                            Majesty’s Government towards the Experts Committees reports, I have the
                            honour to inform you that it is also being brought to the notice of the
                            Governments of France, Belgium, Italy, Japan and Germany by His
                            Majesty’s representatives in those countries.</p>

                        <p>147. The Prime Minister sent for me today and discussed situation of the
                            experts’ report. He has received absolute assurances from Germany that
                            the Government will accept it; the same assurances from Italy and a
                            statement from Italian Ambassador that their expert on Reparation
                            Commission will act with the British. The Prime Minister has had a
                            favorable letter from France through Lord Crewe,<note n="15" xml:id="d8fn15">British Ambassador in France.</note> but not
                            definite, and a noncommittal reply from Belgium evidently influenced by
                            France’s attitude. He is using utmost endeavors to obtain absolute
                            unanimity for an unconditional acceptance, and he will go so far as to
                            insist upon this, or he will raise the whole question of the legality of
                            the occupation of the Ruhr, tariffs, and the Saar administration. He
                            told me unofficially <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0107"/>that he knew
                            that the American Government is not in any way committed officially and
                            that it was not officially represented, although American citizens had
                            done valuable work on the committee. He was, however, wondering if the
                            American Government would consider whether some statement of its views,
                            while in no way committing it to action, might help European Governments
                            to take wise steps at the present moment. His suggestion was that,
                            without committing our Government to any definite action, you might
                            approve or praise the commission’s [<hi rend="italic">committee’s?</hi>]
                            report and express view that it seems a fair basis for action. He said
                            he was aware that the American Government was not directly interested
                            and that he did not desire to involve it, but that some of the European
                            Governments, by reason of elections and other circumstances, are in a
                            difficult position, and, he felt sure, would welcome a pronouncement
                            that would make it easier for them to do the right thing. He thought
                            that if this statement could emanate from Washington it would render
                            great service to Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister believes that the report will be accepted, but he
                            thinks that a word from you would, at this time, be very valuable. He
                            said that he made the suggestion with some hesitation but added that he
                            knew that neither my Government nor I would misunderstand it.</p>

                            Coolidge at the Annual Luncheon of the Associated Press at New York City
                            are transmitted for your information.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The finding of the experts, which is known as the Dawes Report, has
                                recently been made and published. It shows a great deal of research
                                and investigation, and a broad comprehension of the requirements of
                                the situation. It has been favorably received by the Reparations
                                Commission. It is gratifying to understand that the <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0108"/>Allies are looking upon it with full
                                sympathy, and Germany has expressed a willingness to cooperate in
                                the execution of the plan. There appears to be every reason to hope
                                that the report offers a basis for a practical solution of the
                                reparations problem. I trust that it may commend itself to all the
                                European governments interested as a method by which, through mutual
                                concessions, they can arrive at a stable adjustment of the intricate
                                and vexatious problem of reparations, and that such an outcome will
                                provide for the restoration of Germany and the largest possible
                                payments to the other countries.</p>
                            <p>A situation at once both intricate and difficult has been met in a
                                most masterful way. Our countrymen are justified in looking at the
                                result with great pride. Nothing of more importance to Europe has
                                occurred since the Armistice.</p>
                            <p>Part of the plan contemplates that a considerable loan should at once
                                be made to Germany for immediate pressing needs, including the
                                financing of a bank. I trust that private American capital will be
                                willing to participate in advancing this loan. Sound business
                                reasons exist why we should participate in the financing of works of
                                peace in Europe, though we have repeatedly asserted that we were not
                                in favor of advancing funds for any military purpose. It would
                                benefit our trade and commerce, and we especially hope that it will
                                provide a larger market for our agricultural production. It is
                                notorious that foreign gold has been flowing into our country in
                                great abundance. It is altogether probable that some of it can be
                                used more to our financial advantage in Europe than it can be in the
                                United States. Besides this, there is the humanitarian requirement,
                                which carries such a strong appeal, and the knowledge that out of
                                our abundance it is our duty to help where help will be used for
                                meeting just requirements and the promotion of a peaceful purpose.
                                We have determined to maintain, and can maintain, our own political
                                independence, but our economic independence will be strengthened and
                                increased when the economic stability of Europe is restored.</p>
                            <p>We hope further that such a condition will be the beginning of a
                                secure and enduring peace. Certainly it would remove many of the
                                present sources of disagreement and misunderstanding among the
                                European nations. When this adjustment is finally made, and has had
                                sufficient time of operation to become a settled European policy, it
                                would lay the foundation for a further effort at disarmament in
                                accordance with the theory of the Washington Conference. Although
                                that gathering was able to limit capital battleships, it had to
                                leave the question of submarines, air craft, and land forces
                                unsolved. The main reason for this was the unsettled and almost
                                threatening condition that still existed in Europe. A final
                                adjustment for the liquidation of reparations ought to be the
                                beginning of a new era of peace and good will.</p>
                            <p>In the event that such a condition develops, it becomes pertinent to
                                examine what can be done by our own country, in cooperation with
                                others, further to rid ourselves and the rest of the world of the
                                menace and burden of competitive armaments and more effectively
                                insure the settlement of differences between nations, not by a
                                recourse to arms, but by a recourse to reason; not by action leading
                                to war, but by action leading to justice. Our past experience should
                                warn us not to be overconfident in the face of so many failures, but
                                    <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0109"/>it also justifies the
                                hope that something may be done where already there has been some
                                success, and at least we can demonstrate that we have done all that
                                we can.</p>
                            <p>As a result of American initiative there is already in existence The
                                Hague Tribunal which is equipped to function wherever arbitration
                                seems desirable, and based in part on that, and in part on the
                                League, there is the International Court of Justice, which is
                                already functioning. A proposal was sent to the last Senate by
                                President Harding for our adherence to the covenant establishing
                                this court, which I submitted to the favorable consideration of the
                                present Senate in my annual message. Other plans for a World Court
                                have been broached, but up to the present time this has seemed to me
                                the most practical one. But these proposals for arbitration and
                                courts are not put forward by those who are well informed with the
                                idea that they could be relied upon as an adequate means for
                                entirely preventing war. They are rather a method of securing
                                adjustment of claims and differences, and for the enforcement of
                                treaties, when the usual channels of diplomatic negotiation fail to
                                resolve the difficulty.</p>
                            <p>Proposals have also been made for the codification of international
                                law. Undoubtedly something might be accomplished in this direction,
                                although a very large body of such law consists in undertaking to
                                establish rules of warfare and determining the rights of neutrals.
                                One of the difficulties to be encountered would be the necessity of
                                securing the consent of all the nations, but no doubt the agreement
                                of the major powers would go very far in producing that result.</p>
                            <p>I do not claim to be able to announce any formula that will guarantee
                                the peace of the world. There are certain definite things however
                                that I believe can be done, which certainly ought to be tried, that
                                might relieve the people of the earth of much of the burden of
                                military armaments and diminish the probability of military
                                operations. I believe that among these are frequent international
                                conferences suited to particular needs. The Washington Conference
                                did a great deal to restore harmony and good will among the nations.
                                Another purpose of a conference is the further limitation of
                                competitive armaments. Much remains to be accomplished in that
                                direction. It would appear to be impractical to attempt action under
                                present conditions, but with a certain and definite settlement of
                                German reparations firmly established, I should favor the calling of
                                a similar conference to achieve such limitations of armaments and
                                initiate plans for a codification of international law, should
                                preliminary inquiries disclose that such a proposal would meet with
                                a sympathetic response. But the main hope of success lies in first
                                securing a composed state of the public mind in Europe.</p>
                            <p>It is my firm belief that America is in a position to take the lead
                                in this direction.”</p>

                            <item>In the matter of whether the United States should participate in
                                the experts’ plan with a view to the payment of American claims,
                                there seem to be these alternatives, namely, indefinite postponement
                                or an attempt to collect from Germany directly. The latter step
                                would tend to undo the experts’ plan, inasmuch as the provisions
                                touching the budget and transfers are based on an estimate of
                                Germany’s maximum and transferable capacity. The whole scheme of
                                transfer control under committee plan will break down if extensive
                                transfers are made outside of the plan.</item>

                            <item>From an international point of view I am inclined to feel that the
                                United States may well assert claim to a share in payments. The
                                moment is especially favorable to urging that we be paid on an equal
                                footing with the Allies by reason of President Coolidge’s public
                                praise of the plan, the need for an American loan, the language of
                                the experts’ report including the costs of the United States, and
                                the advantage to the Allies of American participation because of the
                                moral effect in influencing Germany to meet her obligations. To file
                                a reservation would cast possible cloud on the plan and would
                                postpone our chance of payment unless we were to enter into
                                competition with the Allies and make direct collections from
                                Germany.</item>

                            <item>Our Government might propose that, in agreement with Germany and
                                the Allies, it might receive, say, 5 percent per annum, or a flat
                                annual sum from funds deposited in a special account in bank of
                                Germany. If Allies admit claim, they are likely to insist on a
                                percentage instead of on a flat sum, so we would participate <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with them.</item>

                                    <item>The disposition of enemy property. The Allies feel that
                                        the United States has in hand funds out of which to meet
                                        part of American claims, and that our Government should not
                                        release these funds and then demand direct contributions
                                        from Germany, as Germany’s ability to pay the Allies would
                                        be reduced thereby. The subject apparently is one requiring
                                        Congressional action, but the following procedure may be
                                        worthy the Department’s consideration. <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0111"/>Should the Executive branch
                                        of the Government decide to participate in the experts’
                                        plan, it might promise to recommend to the Congress that
                                        former enemy property be liquidated upon the condition that
                                        German Government would compensate private owners by paying
                                        them from such a percentage of the annual payment in marks
                                        deposited in the Bank of Germany as might be allocated to
                                        the United States under the experts’ plan. This scheme has
                                        the advantage of providing compensation to private owners;
                                        it does not involve an additional burden upon Germany; and
                                        it eliminates the exchange difficulties connected with
                                        transfer of Germany’s mark payments to extent that German
                                        owners are resident in Germany.</item>

                                        permanently retained by the United States should be computed

                                    <item>Priority between our claims for Army costs and for the
                                        awards of the Mixed Claims Commission. This question is in
                                        part one of internal policy, and it is wholly possible that
                                        private claimants may object to having United States
                                        allocate receipts to its own claim first, while private
                                        citizens are left to await their chances. It is unfortunate
                                        that the Army Costs Agreement of May 25, 1923, has not yet
                                        been ratified; and it is quite probable that, if we decide
                                        to participate, the Allies may wish to scrap the agreement
                                        and to have one sum allotted to us to cover all claims,
                                        thereby leaving apportioning of amount to discretion of the
                                        United States. Even if the Allies do ratify Army Costs
                                        Agreement ultimately, they will bear in mind this financial
                                        obligation in making any further concessions to us on our
                                        other claim.</item>

                            <item>I wish to emphasize the urgency of an early decision on the points
                                I have raised. It is wholly probable that the Allied Governments are
                                now formulating individual plans for division of funds which will
                                make it all the more difficult for us to participate. An
                                inter-Allied conference sometime next month is almost certain, and
                                if we could reach a decision well in advance, it would be most
                                helpful. Bluntly speaking, we must definitely decide, during or
                                before the conference, to come in or stay out. To file a reserve is
                                for practical purposes merely to postpone the evil day, and in
                                effect is a decision to stay out. I expect opposition to the
                                American claims, but for <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0112"/>the
                                reasons stated in (2) above, I think the present offers special
                                opportunity to overcome this opposition. If the United States
                                asserts its claim, I believe technical points should be disregarded
                                as far as possible, and the claim be based on broad grounds of
                                equity. I should appreciate an expression of the Department’s
                                general views at such time as may be convenient.</item>

                            <item>In my observations on this question of policy, I have spoken of
                                internal aspects of the question of participation which will
                                immediately suggest themselves to you, such as, for example,
                                political repercussion, part Congress should play in reaching a
                                decision on the course to be followed, and question of competence of
                                the Executive to waive or reduce any part of the total of American
                                claims. It is probable that the Executive has not such power.
                                Participation in conference would not be waiving or reducing claims
                                but instead would be attempting to collect them. It is conceivable,
                                however, that if others are forced to scale down their claims, they
                                may request us to do same.</item>

                        <p>(1) It is the expectation of the United States Government that it shall
                            share in the payments proposed by the experts’ plan. These payments will
                            apparently comprise the total amounts for which Germany may be liable to
                            the Allied and Associated Powers for war costs (see section XI, part
                                I<note n="17" xml:id="d12fn17">See “Report of Committee of Experts
                                to Reparation Commission,” <hi rend="italic">Federal Be-serve
                                    Bulletin</hi>, May 1924, pp. 351, 365; also Great Britain, Cmd.
                                2105, p. 33.</note>), and are intended to utilize all resources of
                            Germany which may be available for this purpose. Obviously, therefore,
                            the approval of this Government is essential before the plan can be put
                            into full operation in such a way as to affect the rights of the United
                            States. Expressions in support of the plan which have been made public
                            by this Government, such as in the President’s address of April 22,<note n="18" xml:id="d12fn18">See circular telegram of Apr. 23, 3 p.m.,
                                    <ref target="#pg_13">p. 13</ref>.</note> have been based on the
                            assumption that the Allied Governments would willingly agree to a fair
                            participation by the United States. To the end that the plan may become
                            satisfactorily operative, therefore, this Government wishes to reach <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0113"/>a satisfactory understanding with
                            the Allied Governments concerning American participation in the
                            contemplated payments.</p>
                        <p>It is not proposed to discuss, in negotiations concerning American
                            participation, any technical question concerning the rights of the
                            United States, as a power which has not ratified the Treaty of
                            Versailles, <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> the powers which have
                            ratified that treaty, since it is believed that insistence upon such a
                            technical question would be precluded by the manifest equities of the
                            United States as a cobeL–ligerent which contributed so materially to the
                            defeat of Germany and her Allies. Furthermore, as between the United
                            States and Germany, the rights of the United States to compensation have
                            been accorded as fully as the rights of any of the Allied Powers, and
                            the rights of the United States against Germany cannot be disregarded
                            when Germany is dealt with on the basis of its full capacity of payment.
                            The reference, in section XI of part I of the plan, to “all amounts for
                            which Germany may be liable to the Allied and Associated Powers”
                            manifestly contemplates this.</p>
                        <p>(2) The American claims include, first, accrued Army costs, and, second,
                            other Government claims and claims and debts of American nationals
                            submitted to the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, for
                            adjudication. In view of the fact that American Army costs were not
                            covered, as would have been equitable, <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>
                            with Allies’ costs, priorities in favor of this claim are provided in
                            the Wadsworth Agreement,<note n="19" xml:id="d12fn19">Army Costs
                                Agreement, <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_180"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 180</ref>.</note> cognizance of which has been
                            taken by the Reparation Commission and which has already been approved
                            by all the interested States except France. This fact should be taken
                            into account in any new arrangement regarding distribution.</p>
                        <p>The second category covers amounts which rank on an equal footing with
                            Allied claims (viz., reparations, clearing payments, restitution,
                            Alsace-Lorraine payments, etc., see top of page 25, experts’ report),
                            which are expected to be covered out of German payments. Naturally,
                            however, all such claims, both American and Allied, rank after service
                            of proposed loan, costs of control and administration, and accrued as
                            well as necessary current army costs.</p>
                        <p>Apart from Army costs, claims in a total amount of about $1,225,000,000
                            have been filed with the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and
                            Germany, which has been established to determine the amount of American
                            claims against Germany and debts due from Germans to Americans. In this
                            total there are not included claims for amounts of the nature of those
                            covered by paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of annex I to part VIII of the Treaty
                            of Versailles. It is understood, however, that the total of Allied
                            claims against Germany would be greatly reduced if the amount of their
                            claims under these headings <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0114"/>were
                            deducted from the 132,000,000,000 gold marks. The United States has
                            substantially reduced the total of its claims against Germany by
                            refraining from presenting claims of these categories. The total amount
                            awarded by the Mixed Claims Commission, United States and Germany, will
                            be materially less than the amount of the claims filed. The United
                            States, of course, will seek payment only of its Army costs and of
                            amounts actually adjudicated. The amount of the American claims against
                            Germany will be reduced to a very much further degree than apparently
                            has been the case in the Allied States, by the awards to be handed down
                            by the Mixed Claims Commission. The expectation of the United States to
                            obtain payment of the amounts awarded is therefore reasonable.</p>
                        <p>(3) With respect to the accrued American Army costs, which amount to
                            about $255,000,000, provision is made in the Wadsworth Agreement for
                            payment in twelve installments which shall have a certain degree of
                            priority over the current army costs of the Allies from 1927. As yet no
                            payments have been received under this agreement. In case none are
                            received before the priority over current army costs becomes effective
                            in 1927, the agreement obviously contemplates that the total amount
                            shall be paid in the eight remaining installments, thus involving annual
                            payments averaging over $31,500,000. Since the Dawes Plan contemplates
                            that substantially all the sums to be paid by Germany during the first
                            two years after its adoption shall be expended in Germany, it is
                            possible that, if the plan goes into effect, no substantial payments
                            would be made under the Army Costs Agreement until 1927, thus leaving to
                            be made the average annual payment indicated above.</p>
                        <p>When the Army Costs Agreement was entered into, the reparation situation
                            was much more obscure than it now is, and this Government sees no reason
                            why provision should not be made for the payment to the United States of
                            similar installments from the German payments under the Dawes Plan. In
                            view, however, of the fact that this Government will insist upon a
                            participation in Germany’s payments on behalf of other American claims,
                            this Government is) disposed to extend to 20 (or possibly 24) the number
                            of installments provided by the Wadsworth Agreement for the payment of
                            American Army costs, provided that after the first two years there shall
                            be assigned to this Government, for application to other American
                            claims, an additional amount equal to 2½ percent of the annuities paid
                            by Germany under the Dawes Plan.</p>
                        <p>It should be understood that beginning with 1927 the American Army cost
                            installments shall have priority just preceding current army costs.
                            Provision should also be made that there shall be no priorities
                            preceding the 2½ percent payments except the service of the 800,000,000
                            gold marks loan, the costs of the Reparation <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0115"/>Commission and other bodies and agencies established
                            under the treaty or the Dawes Plan, and necessary costs of armies of
                            occupation. It is estimated that these priorities will amount to about
                            359,000,000 gold marks per year, to wit: 82,000,000 gold marks for
                            service of the loan (assuming 7 percent interest and amortization by
                            20-year sinking fund); 37,000,000 gold marks for costs of Reparation
                            Commission and other agents of control (estimated on the basis of
                            present outlay); and 240,000,000 gold marks current army costs.</p>
                        <p>(4) It is contemplated by the Dawes Plan that the Reparation Commission
                            may sell the 16,000,000,000 gold marks of railway and industrial bonds
                            to be delivered to the trustee, which are to bear 5 percent interest and
                            1 percent for sinking fund. It should be stipulated that if the bonds
                            are sold, the interest paid on them shall nevertheless be included in
                            the amount of Germany’s annual payments for the purpose of determining
                            the 2½ percent to be paid to the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In any agreement for United States participation in a percentage of
                            current payments, there should be included also provision for similar
                            participation in capital receipts, such as from the flotation of a large
                            international loan or from payments in advance.</p>
                        <p>(5) It is possible that an attempt may be made by the Allied Governments
                            to bring up some question concerning the disposition of enemy property
                            taken over by the United States Government. As the disposition of this
                            enemy property is a matter to be determined by Congress, this Government
                            holds that any arrangement of the kind indicated above should in no way
                            bind the United States with respect thereto. The Treaty of Versailles
                            clearly left each Allied or Associated Government the option of
                            retaining or returning such property. The Allied Governments have
                            exercised their option of retaining it. The Government of the United
                            States must remain equally free to retain or release the property as it
                            may ultimately see fit in the exercise of its option. If any property is
                            finally appropriated to the payment of American claims, the value
                            thereof will, of course, be credited against these claims against
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>(6) The statement in paragraph 5 applies not only to property taken over
                            by the Alien Property Custodian, but to vessels, title to which was
                            taken under the Joint Resolution of Congress of May 12, 1917. Both these
                            cases come under section IV of part X of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
                        <p>(7) In respect of cables, however, when they shall be definitely
                            allocated to the United States, this Government is prepared to credit
                            the fair value thereof against its claims.</p>
                        <p>(8) A definite understanding should be reached on maximum amount of
                            current army costs. Including the costs under articles <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0116"/>8 to 12 of the Rhineland Agreement of
                            June, 1919,<note n="20" xml:id="d12fn20"><hi rend="italic">Official

                            these costs should not in any event be greater than 240,000,000 gold
                            marks, the amount deemed sufficient under the Wilson-Lloyd
                            George-Clemenceau Agreement of June 16, 1919.<note n="21" xml:id="d12fn21"><hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State

                                978.</note> The maximum amount should if possible be reduced below
                            this figure in order to keep the burden of these costs as light as
                            possible that the remainder of German payments be released for other
                            charges. In like manner the costs of the agencies of control and
                            administration should be reduced to the minimum.</p>
                        <p>(9) Later on, possibly, some arrangement may be made whereby German
                            nationals might be compensated by their Government in German marks out
                            of the American share of the proposed deposit to the credit of the Agent
                            for reparation payments, this Government in turn to receive compensation
                            therefor by utilization of a similar amount from alien property held in
                            the United States. This would be one way to avoid difficulties in regard
                            to transfers should they arise.</p>
                        <p>(10) You will bear in mind that the Government of the United States is
                            firmly convinced of the equity of an arrangement along the lines that
                            have been set forth above. This Government desires at the appropriate
                            moment to negotiate an arrangement to cover American participation in
                            these payments. Before arrangements for distribution will have become
                            crystallized it is important, obviously, that the Allied Governments be
                            informed of this Government’s position. The Department desires,
                            therefore, to have from you, as soon as possible, any comments you may
                            wish to make on this telegram, together with your suggestions about time
                            and manner in which it would be advisable to indicate to the Allied
                            Governments the position of the Government of the United States in this
                            matter. It is obvious that the plan cannot become operative except with
                            the accord of the United States, of special importance being the
                            friendly interest of this Government in the proposed loan. The Allied
                            Governments should be glad to have this Government associated with them
                            in cooperation as a creditor of Germany rather than to have any lack of
                            harmony between the action of this Government on the one hand and the
                            Allies on the other in seeking to obtain payment of their just
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>(11) These present proposals rest on the understanding that the plan will
                            be accepted in its entirety. If it is proposed to modify this plan in
                            any material way, however, the Government of the United States would
                            wish, of course, to consider proposed modification on the withdrawal of
                            these proposals as the changes might warrant.</p>

                        <p>182. L–81, for Logan. You may find helpful the following information on
                            how the Department reached views set forth in its telegram L–80, June
                            14, 1 p.m.</p>

                            <item>The total amount of the probable awards on account of American
                                claims, which includes claims of this Government except Army costs,
                                has been estimated roughly at $300,000,000. You will understand that
                                this figure is given with the greatest reserve and without any
                                commitment whatever, and that you are not to divulge it or use it in
                                any way. The total amount finally awarded may quite possibly differ
                                substantially from above estimate.</item>

                                132 billion gold marks was agreed upon. For these reasons the
                                Department does not believe that the Allied Governments can properly
                                insist on being informed of the amount of American claim, more
                                especially as it will represent amounts which have actually been
                                adjudicated, not merely estimated amounts.</item>

                                say.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>On the one hand the Department is anxious to retain the prior
                                position of the Army cost claim, because of the manifest equity
                                which the Allied Governments cannot dispute; and on the other, it is
                                important that private claims should be paid at earliest date
                                possible. The Department has felt, accordingly, that the most
                                desirable arrangement would be one providing for current payments to
                                cover both classes of claims on what would amount to a fifty-fifty
                                basis, as the total amount of Army costs and other claims would be
                                not far from equal if the estimate given above be correct.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>If the payment of the Army costs be extended over a period of 20
                                years, the United States should receive annually one-half of the
                                estimated installment of $31,500,000, or about 65,000,000 gold
                                marks. If the payments were to be extended over a period of 24
                                years, the annual amount received would approximate 53,000,000 gold
                                marks. In payment of other claims, 2½ percent of, say, 2,150,000,000
                                gold marks, making allowance for prior charges against <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0118"/>normal annuity payments (see
                                Department’s L–80, last part of paragraph 3), would be equivalent to
                                54,000,000 gold marks. On the foregoing computation the Army cost
                                claim would be covered in 18 to 22 years from the present, and the
                                other claims in about 24 years.</item>

                            be meeting of Prime Ministers, and that they are very likely to send you

                            that they did not wish to embarrass you or request you to do anything
                            which you feel our Government would not be justified in doing at this
                            stage, but would leave it to you to help them in any way you feel
                            proper; and that should an invitation be extended to have representative
                            present or to appoint one, he hoped that it would be some outstanding

                        <p>(1) Department’s L–80, June 14, 1 p.m. As soon as the Department has
                            reached a decision on the points presented below, I think that the
                            Principal Allied Powers should be advised of the position of our
                            Government in regard to participation in the proceeds of the Dawes Plan,
                            but I am not yet sure that exactly the right time has come for this
                            notification. The Allies should be firmly committed among themselves and
                            for that reason I suggest that the Department’s <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0119"/>announcement be deferred until I have
                            ascertained the results of the Herriot-MacDonald conference and also the
                            object and scope of the inter-Allied meeting which has been reported in
                            the press as set for July 16. I expect to obtain data on these two
                            matters in a couple of days, and I shall then report immediately to the
                            Department, giving my recommendations.</p>
                        <p>(2) In fixing the amount to be attributed to American claims with the
                            exception of Army costs at 2½ percent, does Department mean that that
                            percentage is to be computed on the lump annual installment before
                            deduction of our prior Army costs annuity, or is it to be computed on
                            the remainder of the net installment after deduction of our Army
                            annuity?</p>
                        <p>(3) I understand Department’s statement that the 2½ percent allocation is
                            to start with the beginning of the third year as being in substance a
                            reply to a question I raised in a previous telegram,<note n="25" xml:id="d15fn25">Not printed.</note> and a decision that the
                            Government of the United States will not assert participation in
                            proceeds of the loan for which the Dawes Plan provides, of course
                            assuming that the loan is used for purposes described. If the loan were
                            used in whole or in part for a direct cash reparation payment it would,
                                <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi>, come within the terms of the Army
                            Costs Agreement.</p>
                        <p>(4) I am not entirely clear on the purport of latter part of your
                            paragraph 3, which I understand as meaning that the special Belgian
                            payment provided for by article 232 of the Treaty of Versailles should
                            not have special priority but should be lumped in with other reparation
                            claims. If this be proper construction I wholly agree.</p>
                        <p>(5) I understand that we should assert participation in extra capital
                            sums received from the flotation of railway bonds or otherwise.
                            Department’s instruction goes on to say that if Treasury bonds are sold,
                            interest provided for therein should nevertheless be included in
                            computation of German installments for purpose of assessing the 2½
                            percent. Would this not be a double employment, of the same fund? That
                            is, the United States, having received a capital amount of the bonds,
                            will be deemed to be earning interest on the amount received. Agent
                            General for reparation payments or the trustee would have to pay
                            interest accruing on bonds themselves directly to purchasers, so that if
                            our Government demands a percentage of interest so paid, the amount paid
                            it would have to come out of other receipts under the plan. I fear that
                            the Allies would raise objection to this double employment of bond
                            interest for credit to the United States.</p>
                        <p>(6) I appreciate how extremely difficult it is to make even an
                            approximate estimate of the ultimate total of awards by the Mixed <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0120"/>Claims Commission, and I realize
                            that this matter is of less importance than fixation of our
                            participation at 2½ percent.</p>
                        <p>I have received Department’s telegram L–81, June 14, 2 p.m. Allies are
                            certain to ask for approximation of our total claim in order that they
                            may have some idea about number of years it would require to satisfy our
                            claim in full, assuming the successful operation of the Dawes Plan.
                            Capital claims are already fixed, of course, even if capital debt of
                            Germany is not yet fixed under the plan. For that reason I recommend
                            that the Department consider drawing up a rough estimate without any
                            commitment and with all necessary reservations which could then be
                            transmitted to the Allies, at least confidentially. It is desirable,
                            naturally, that for purposes of negotiation the total amount be
                            estimated at as low a figure as is prudently possible.</p>
                        <p>(7) Department has presented effective answers to questions I have
                            previously raised, but one minor point seems to have been overlooked. If
                            it should become desirable to allocate blocks of bonds to individual
                            powers directly in order that they might float them internally along
                            with their own, perhaps without governmental guarantee, would the
                            Government of the United States accept any portion of a block?</p>
                        <p>(8) I am inclined to agree with Department’s stand in regard to German
                            ships, but for reasons somewhat different. I doubt the desirability of
                            assimilating these ships to private property under article 297, Treaty
                            of Versailles, as Department intimates in paragraph 6. The Reparation
                            Commission has already decided, I believe correctly, that the shipping
                            clauses of the treaty and article 297 were mutually exclusive and that
                            German vessels held by the Allied Powers were not retained under article
                            297 of the treaty, but were delivered to the commission under annex 3,
                            part 8, except such vessels as had been previously condemned as good
                            prize or had been legally expropriated otherwise; and in my opinion our
                            strong point is that the former German ships were not German at the time
                            of the signing or of the coming into force of the treaty, but had
                            already become American vessels by the lawful process of
                            expropriation.</p>
                        <p>The Allied Governments may, however, take the view that as we are
                            brushing aside technical questions of law, the matter of the ships
                            should be considered on a broad, equitable basis. The vessels differ
                            appreciably from private property held by the Alien Property Custodian,
                            for they have actually been expropriated and allocated to the Government
                            of the United States by itself. I think that [position taken by
                            Department is proper?], however, inasmuch as these ships are the only
                            thing that we got out of the war.</p>
                        <p>(9) I am pleased with the spirit and detail of Department’s telegram; I
                            believe it marks a great step forward toward successful <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0121"/>operation of the plan, and the possible
                            realization of our claims. If any of the matters referred to above
                            demand lengthy consideration, I suggest that when the moment is
                            auspicious for annexes to our general position to be presented to the
                            Allies, it will not be necessary for all details to have been adjusted
                            in final form. They can be worked out during the interim between the
                            official announcement of our position and the forthcoming negotiations.
                            Logan.</p>

                        <p>174. Your 220, June 18, 4 p.m. Department deems it inadvisable for this
                            Government to be represented at Prime Ministers’ meeting. This meeting
                            seems to be appropriate for representatives of those Governments whose
                            action is necessary to put Dawes Plan into effect. While the Government
                            of the United States is most desirous that Dawes Plan should be promptly
                            put into execution, and sympathizes with efforts to that end, its action
                            is not required to make plan effective, assuming that its just interests
                            would not be jeoparded. That is to say, our claims against Germany
                            should be protected properly when it comes to questions of distribution,
                            but this point is separate from necessary arrangements to put plan into
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>In view of Mr. Logan’s intimate knowledge of Dawes Plan and of this
                            Government’s views respecting settlement of questions of its claims
                            against Germany, the Department has instructed him to be prepared to go
                            to London about July 16, and informally to keep in touch with conference
                            for purposes of information and to furnish a medium for any advisable
                            communications with Department. Not desired that Mr. Logan should attend
                            the meetings. An invitation has not yet been received and the Department
                            would prefer that one should not be formally extended.</p>
                        <p>You may inform the Prime Minister that while his suggestion is
                            appreciated, the Government of the United States does not see its way
                            clear to be represented at the meeting, but that this Government will
                            take pleasure in instructing Mr. Logan to be present in London at the
                            time of the meeting for purposes of information.</p>
                        <p>Should it appear that matter of distribution is to be taken up, or that
                            American claims might be involved, we shall wish Mr. Logan to be heard
                            in any appropriate way. At present this is not to be mentioned. For the
                            present, Department assumes that only steps to put plan into operation
                            are being thought of.</p>

                        <p>224. My 223, June 24, 8 p.m. The following is memorandum referred to:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his
                                    compliments to the United States Ambassador and has the honor
                                    herewith to confirm in writing the observations which he was
                                    able to make to His Excellency in the course of their recent
                                    verbal discussion and in regard to which further explanations
                                    have since been furnished to His Excellency by the permanent
                                    Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                                <p>Secretary of State has been in personal consultation with the
                                    Belgian Prime Minister and more recently with the new French
                                    Prime Minister regarding the steps to be taken to put into
                                    immediate operation the scheme embodied in the Dawes report.
                                    This report has already been approved by all the Governments
                                    concerned, who have declared their readiness to adopt it in its
                                    entirety. The informal discussions which have taken place with
                                    the Belgian and French Ministers have centered therefore not so
                                    much upon the principle of the report as upon the exact measures
                                    which must be taken to give effect to its recommendations. It
                                    has been generally agreed that the following measures will be
                                    best calculated to secure this object.</p>
                                <p>The recommendations embodied in the Dawes report will impose upon
                                    Germany obligations altogether beyond what was laid down by the
                                    Treaty of Versailles. It will be necessary therefore that these
                                    recommendations should be embodied in some kind of formal
                                    document or arrangement to be signed by the powers who will be
                                    responsible for their execution. If Germany is to give her
                                    assent she for her part will justifiably expect to receive as a
                                    counterpart to the obligations which she will assume in adopting
                                    these new undertakings a corresponding undertaking on the part
                                    of the other powers that the <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0123"/>economic and fiscal sanctions which have in the
                                    past been imposed upon Germany shall be withdrawn.</p>
                                <p>It would be undesirable to give to the instrument of agreement a
                                    form which would have the appearance of a treaty explicitly
                                    modifying the Treaty of Versailles. It is felt that the most
                                    convenient form will be that of a protocol which might contain
                                    provisions covering the following points: <list>

                                        <item>Agreement by the Allied Governments that these

                                            flagrant failure on the part of the German Government to

                                            the designation of an authority who would be charged if
                                            necessity arose with the duty of deciding whether such
                                            default had indeed taken place. This duty cannot
                                            properly be entrusted to the Reparation Commission whose
                                            functions are strictly determined by the Treaty of
                                            Versailles since the engagements to be entered into
                                            under the Dawes scheme lie to a certain extent outside
                                            the scope of that treaty. Some impartial and independent
                                            authority will have to be agreed upon who could properly
                                            undertake this duty and whose decisions would be
                                            accepted as binding on all the parties concerned.</item>

                                <p>For the purpose of negotiating the terms of such a protocol some
                                    further discussion will clearly be necessary and it is now
                                    proposed that an inter-Allied conference shall meet in London on
                                    July 16th next to be followed, so soon as agreement has been
                                    reached, by a fuller conference in which Germany will be invited
                                    to participate. The powers who will be asked to send
                                    representatives to this conference will be France, Italy, Japan,
                                    Belgium and such of the minor powers as are entitled to
                                    reparation. These minor powers will however it is hoped be
                                    represented merely by their Ministers accredited to the Court of
                                    St. James.</p>
                                <p>The conference will be strictly confined to an examination of the
                                    measures necessary to give effect to the recommendations of the
                                    Dawes committee.” Such questions as security and inter-Allied
                                    debts are to be explicitly excluded. With this limitation the
                                    conference should be able to conclude its discussions within a
                                    short period. One week may perhaps suffice.</p>
                                <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0124"/>
                                <p>The greatest importance is attached by the Allied Governments to
                                    the presence at this conference of representatives of the United
                                    States of America. It is not for the Allied Governments and
                                    still less for His Majesty’s Government to suggest in what
                                    particular capacity the United States representatives might
                                    attend: this is a matter which must be left entirely to the
                                    United States Government who can themselves decide what can
                                    properly be done. There is no desire to cause them any
                                    embarrassment or expectation that they will take any action
                                    which for constitutional or other reasons they may be reluctant
                                    to take. The Secretary of State ventures however to remind the
                                    United States Ambassador that the report was framed under the
                                    direction and stimulus of a citizen of the United States and
                                    that but for the moral authority and technical experience of
                                    General Dawes and his assistants the report might never have
                                    been agreed upon or might have proved less decisive and less
                                    widely acceptable.</p>
                                <p>The success of the scheme outlined by General Dawes must depend
                                    predominantly on the flotation of the contemplated loan, the
                                    subscriptions for which will inevitably have to come largely
                                    from the United States of America. In examining the measures by
                                    which the report can be put into operation the powers will
                                    therefore desire to give particular weight to the possible views
                                    and feelings of the United States public; and they would be
                                    somewhat embarrassed in this endeavor if the United States
                                    Government were to hold themselves entirely aloof from the
                                    discussion.</p>
                                <p>It is not, however, merely on such incidental reasoning that Mr.
                                    MacDonald desires to ask Mr. Kellogg to enlist the cooperation
                                    of his Government in the difficult and vital negotiations which
                                    are so shortly to open. The Dawes report has placed the problem
                                    of German reparation on a more expert and a more practicable
                                    basis; it has at the same time given to the problem a scope
                                    which is wider and for that reason more humane. His Majesty’s
                                    Government would deeply regret if the discussions were again to
                                    be restricted solely to those powers who have a too direct
                                    interest in the matter and if the moral influence of the United
                                    States which contributed in so essential a manner to the framing
                                    of the report were to be withdrawn at the moment when Europe is
                                    intent upon its execution.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary of State would therefore be indebted to the United
                                    States Ambassador if he would now lay these considerations
                                    before his Government and would impress upon them the
                                    desirability in the general interest of their consenting in
                                    whatever form may seem to them advisable to participate in the
                                    impending conference. Should the United States Government see
                                    their way to meet the wishes of the Allies in this respect the
                                    Secretary of State expresses the hope that in selecting an
                                    American representative choice may be made of a personality
                                    whose name and position will carry weight both in the United
                                    States and in Europe and so reinforce the authority with which
                                    the conclusions to be arrived at by the conference will be
                                    generally received”.</p>

                        <p>225. Your no. 174, June 24, 5 p.m. The Prime Minister is out of town.
                            Seems impossible to withdraw invitation, as he announced in Parliament
                            on Monday that it would be extended and all papers carry this
                            announcement. I telegraphed you yesterday that the invitation had been
                            received and was being encoded, and the full text was sent you before
                            your 174 reached the Embassy. I suggest that you may wish to consider
                            the text of the Prime Minister’s communication before you decide
                            definitely what steps shall be taken. I think refusal likely to have
                            depressing effect.</p>
                        <p>In regard to last sentence of your telegram. Prime Minister in his
                            statement in Parliament said, among other things:<note n="27" xml:id="d19fn27">Quoted statement not paraphrased.</note></p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The business at the inter-Allied conference will be the Dawes

                                actually in operation, obviously we shall go on to discuss and, I
                                hope, to settle the other outstanding matters between France and
                                ourselves including inter-Allied debts; but I hope the House will be

                                myself—there is going to be no mixing up of inter-Allied debt

                        <p>176. Your nos. 224, June 24, 9 p.m., and 225, June 25, 1 p.m.</p>
                        <p>In view of text of invitation embodied in British memorandum and of the
                            Administration’s desire to do all that it properly can, without the
                            assumption of objectionable obligations on the part of this Government,
                            to promote the putting into effect of the Dawes Plan, the Department has
                            deemed it advisable to take somewhat different course from that stated
                            in its no. 174, June 24, 5 p.m. On the receipt of your telegrams today I
                            took the matter up further with the President; he has now authorized me
                            to instruct you to <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0126"/>attend
                            conference on July 16 for purpose of dealing with such matters as affect
                            interests of this Government and otherwise for purposes of information.
                            Department will instruct Mr. Logan to go to London to assist you. In
                            view of attention that matter has received in press, following statement
                            is being made public this evening at the White House:<note n="28" xml:id="d20fn28">Quoted statement not paraphrased.</note>

                                    this country is vitally interested. It is with this view that in

                                    instructions have been given to Ambassador Kellogg to attend the

                        <p>179. Your no. 224, June 24, 9 p.m. Following for your information and
                            guidance:</p>
                        <p>The Department notes that with view to giving effect to the experts’
                            report, thought is being given to signing by the Allied Governments of
                            some sort of formal instrument, probably in the form of a protocol,
                            which would avoid appearance of a treaty explicitly modifying Treaty of
                            Versailles. While obviously highly desirable that appropriate
                            arrangements be made to give speedy effect to the experts’
                            recommendations, you will appreciate that this Government is not in a
                            position to join in an undertaking to execute recommendations of Dawes
                            report. In particular this Government is not a party to economic and
                            military sanctions. It has long since withdrawn its forces of occupation
                            from Germany. It appears, moreover, that the instrument proposed to be
                            drawn up is of such a nature that for this Government to adhere to it,
                            the advice and consent of the Senate would be required, involving, at
                            best, delay which it is important to avoid. Apart from other
                            considerations, <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0127"/>it would be
                            inadvisable, therefore, from a practical standpoint, to consider making
                            an agreement to which this Government would be a signatory and which
                            would require approval by the Senate before it could be put into effect.
                            To call such an agreement a protocol would not help the matter.</p>
                        <p>The United States has a definite interest and concern, nevertheless, in
                            the situation. Although the United States is not a party to the Treaty
                            of Versailles, in its separate treaty with Germany this Government is
                            accorded certain rights and benefits stipulated for it in the Treaty of
                            Versailles. Under these circumstances Germany, which has entered into
                            certain obligations toward the United States, might consider that this
                            Government should properly be heard in connection with arrangements
                            which look toward Germany’s assumption of new obligations of such
                            importance as those proposed. In particular the Government of the United
                            States is concerned with negotiating at the appropriate time an
                            arrangement by which it may be enabled, in accord with the other
                            Governments which are concerned, to participate in payments pursuant to
                            experts’ plan so that its Army costs, the claims of the Government, and
                            private claims now being adjudicated by the Mixed Claims Commission may
                            suitably be paid. The Department has fully instructed Mr. Logan on this
                            point, and will instruct him to inform you of Department’s position.
                            Apart from this direct interest of the United States in arrangements
                            referred to, the Government of the United States is of course greatly
                            concerned that prompt and efficacious measures looking toward economic
                            recuperation in Europe be taken.</p>
                        <p>It is important that representatives of the United States should do
                            nothing by which it would be made to appear that this Government is
                            participating in imposition on Germany of unduly onerous conditions. In
                            the view of this Government the objective of the forthcoming conference
                            is the promotion of economic recuperation and recovery of just claims
                            against Germany in such a manner as will render unnecessary imposition
                            of sanctions as have been imposed in the past. It is important that no
                            misconception of the position of this Government should obtain
                            currency.</p>
                        <p>It should also be kept in mind that the success with which the experts’
                            plan has met comes from the fact that the Governments as governments
                            were not dealing with the questions involved and that the experts,
                            although not disregardful of political conditions and the attitude of
                            the several Governments, undertook to give appropriate weight to
                            economic conditions. It is important, therefore, that this approach to
                            the question be continued, and that plans should not be jeoparded by
                            introduction of political controversies.</p>
                        <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>With these considerations in mind, I may summarize following points: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Government of the United States does not wish to become a
                                    party to any protocol or other instrument which would involve
                                    participation by this Government in execution of experts’
                                    recommendations, nor does this Government wish to sign any
                                    general instrument necessitating submission to the Senate for
                                    advice and consent to ratification. What has just been said is
                                    not to be taken, however, to preclude possibility that some
                                    separate instrument, appropriate to regulation of payment of
                                    American claims or growing out of treaty between United States
                                    and Germany, might not be deemed advisable. Latter possibility
                                    will be dealt with as situation develops.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>As this Government is not a party to the economic and military
                                    sanctions, no question of its participation in an instrument
                                    relating to sanctions need be raised. In regard to arrangement
                                    of sanctions appropriate to execution of plan, all that United
                                    States can do is use its moral influence with view to prompt
                                    carrying out of experts’ recommendations without introduction of
                                    elements of political controversy which might tend to prevent
                                    satisfactory settlement. Your attendance at forthcoming
                                    conference will be in large measure to manifest earnest desire
                                    of this Government for a prompt settlement, and you will without
                                    doubt find that there will be occasions on which you may
                                    helpfully indicate sentiment of American Government and people
                                    in regard to these matters. You will, of course, in so acting
                                    bear in mind that purpose of conference is to give effect to
                                    experts’ plan, and to create situation in which plan can operate
                                    freely as looked to in experts’ report. It will be desirable,
                                    therefore, that your influence be so exerted that measures of
                                    compulsion which may not flow from plan and from its spirit may
                                    be avoided.</item>

                                <item>Should the Governments arrange for certain sanctions as is
                                    suggested in points 4 and 5 of British memorandum, the
                                    Government of the United States will not, of course, associate
                                    itself with such arrangements. If, however, question of the
                                    selection of an “impartial and independent authority” should be
                                    presented, and if your opinion is asked, you may indicate that
                                    the Permanent Court of International Justice might be available
                                    for purpose desired.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>In regard to suggestion in the British memorandum touching
                                    flotation of proposed loan, and desire of Allied Governments to
                                    give weight to the possible views and feelings of the public of
                                    the United States, you will bear fact in mind that the
                                    Government of the United States is not in position to guarantee
                                    this financing or to assume any responsibility in regard to it.
                                    As was indicated in the President’s address on April 22, this
                                    Government hopes that basis may be found on which American
                                    capital will participate. You will realize that you could not
                                    appropriately take the responsibility of indicating the exact
                                    views and feelings of American investment public. You may,
                                    nevertheless, at times find yourself in a position helpfully to
                                    indicate views of American bankers and investors without
                                    involving this Government in any responsibility. If, for
                                    example, the French representatives should propose retention of
                                    measures which would amount to economic interference in the
                                    occupied territory, you might then say that while you could not
                                    speak for the Government of the <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0129"/>United States in the matter, you felt justified
                                    in stating informally on basis of your knowledge of views of
                                    American investment public, that under those conditions the loan
                                    could not be floated in the United States.</item>

                                    regarding the forthcoming conference in London to consider the
                                    experts’ plan.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Kellogg is now instructed to state that the Government of the
                                    United States has observed with deep interest and gratification
                                    that steps are being taken with a view to putting into effect
                                    the experts’ plan as speedily as possible, and cordially
                                    appreciates the courteous invitation conveyed to the Government
                                    of the United States by His Majesty’s Government. As His
                                    Majesty’s Government will readily understand, the Government of
                                    the United States is not a party to the economic and military
                                    sanctions to which Germany is now subject and is not in a
                                    position to enter into an undertaking to execute the
                                    recommendations of the experts. Nevertheless, the Government of
                                    the United States, believing as it does that the first and
                                    essential step to economic recovery in Europe, in which the
                                    American Government and people are deeply interested, is the
                                    speedy adoption of the experts’ plan, does not desire to stand
                                    aloof from the proposed conference. Therefore, with the
                                    authorization of the President the American Ambassador has been
                                    instructed to attend the conference, in view of the foregoing
                                    considerations and for the purpose of dealing with such matters
                                    as affect the interests of the United States and otherwise for
                                    purposes of information.”</p>

                                    may be worth for purposes of negotiation, and prefers not to

                                    in regard to participation in payments shall have been made

                                <item>The Department appreciates the reasons for your suggestion
                                    that the Allies be given a figure if they ask for it. You will
                                    realize how important it is to take no action that might cause
                                    them to insist that the United States might be given a smaller
                                    percentage. If you deem it absolutely necessary, in connection
                                    with the forthcoming negotiations, you may orally and
                                    confidentially indicate a figure based on the information given
                                    in Department’s telegram L–81, June 14, 2 p.m., paragraph 1,

                                <item>In regard to the allocation of bonds to individual powers the
                                    Department could not commit itself in advance of knowledge of a
                                    particular proposal. For your information, however, and with the
                                    expectation of receiving your comment, I may say provisionally
                                    that it appears that bonds so allocated would constitute a
                                    definite assignment of their income and would, therefore,
                                    constitute desirable security.</item>

                                <item>In regard to vessels Department has failed to locate
                                    Reparation Commission’s decision, the number of which you did
                                    not give. According to your statement vessels are excepted by it
                                    that have been “otherwise legally expropriated,” and as title to
                                    German vessels seized in the United States was acquired long
                                    before conclusion of a treaty these ships would therefore come
                                    within this exception. The Government of the United States would
                                    not under any circumstances permit question of validity of this
                                    title to be raised. It is clear that German interests in and
                                    title to these vessels having been wiped <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0131"/>out, they did not come within
                                    part 8 of annex 3, Treaty of Versailles, which relates to
                                    vessels entitled to fly the German flag or owned or controlled
                                    by Germans.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Reparation Commission took a similar position in regard to German
                            ships seized by Brazil and it would thereby be precluded from taking a
                            different position in the very much stronger case of the ships seized by
                            the United States. According to a statement, July 11, 1921, of the
                            General Secretariat concurring with the Brazilian point of view, the
                            ships constituted private property in an enemy country and were to be
                            dealt with under article 297 of the treaty, and the proceeds of their
                            liquidation might be dealt with by Brazil in the manner provided for
                            under provisions of that article.</p>
                        <p>This statement is significant notwithstanding the fact that the
                            commission, while it approved the opinion of its Legal Service that
                            ships seized by Brazil did not come within part 8, annex 3, took the
                            position that article 297 was not within the competence of the
                            commission. In this position the commission was entirely correct. No
                            authority has been vested in it to construe that article, the
                            construction of article 297 being a question for the particular Allied
                            State within which the property is. The Department calls your attention
                            to statements, with which it agrees, in Mr. Bayne’s letter of May 20,
                                1921,<note n="31" xml:id="d22fn31">Not printed.</note> in regard to
                            application of article 297 to vessels seized by the United States. It
                            seems unnecessary to enter into a detailed discussion on this point with
                            the Allies. It is the position of this Government that while it is free
                            to retain the vessels or return them or their proceeds to the former
                            German owners, due credit will be allowed therefor, if they are
                            retained, on American claims against Germany.</p>
                        <p>In any negotiations in regard to modification of the Army Costs
                            Agreement, the Department offers the following for your further
                            guidance: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The conditions in light of which the Army Costs Agreement was
                                    drawn have obviously been modified by the Dawes Plan. Putting
                                    aside question whether, under Army Costs Agreement, this
                                    Government would be entitled to receipts under Dawes Plan, the
                                    latter contemplates practically no external payments during
                                    first 2 years. The plan refers, moreover, to deliveries in kind
                                    from a different point of view, as these are to be covered from
                                    cash payments made by Germany. Under the circumstances the
                                    Department does not believe that after the second year the
                                    deliveries in kind should take rank ahead of American Army
                                    costs, more especially as there is possibility that deliveries
                                    in kind and other payments under headings of restitution and
                                    clearing payments, etc., might <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0132"/>be expanded to cover all available funds
                                    leaving nothing for American Army costs.</item>

                                <item>In view of the commission of experts’ recommendations in
                                    regard to transfers, it should be understood that payments which
                                    are due on account of American Army cost priority should not
                                    merely constitute a prior charge on deposits accruing in the
                                    German Bank, but would be met from sums actually transferred.
                                    The priority might be somewhat empty otherwise. This point
                                    should not be lost sight of in connection with the drafting of
                                    any instrument having to do with American participation.</item>

                                <item>The Department realizes that Governments concerned had great
                                    difficulty in reaching the Spa Percentage Agreement. To avoid
                                    reopening the question of percentages in order to take account
                                    of participation by the United States, the following procedure
                                    might be adopted for distribution of the amounts remaining after
                                    making deductions for priorities referred to in the last part of
                                    paragraph 3, Department telegram June 14, 1 p.m., and for
                                    American Army cost priority. In accord with Allied Governments,
                                    the United States might agree with German Government that claims
                                    of the United States excepting Army costs be met by series of
                                    annual payments parallel with those projected under the Dawes
                                    Plan in an amount equal to 2½ percent of the payments available
                                    for distribution to the creditor Governments. In this way this
                                    percentage of payment would be brought within the “inclusive”
                                    payments which are a part of the plan, and the Spa percentages
                                    might apply to remainder. This Government is prepared to agree
                                    that any percentage payment of this kind to the United States
                                    should take rank, as far as payment and transfer of payment is
                                    concerned, equally with payment to the other creditor
                                    Governments of all obligations to them after the priorities
                                    indicated, including of course priority for American Army costs,
                                    have been covered.</item>

                        <p>323. L–184, from Logan.</p>
                        <p>1. It is not entirely clear from your L–80, June 14, 1 p.m. what
                            Department’s feeling is on priority position that should be accorded <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0133"/>our past Army costs. The
                            instruction gives inference that we should maintain the priority granted
                            by the agreement pending and should merely extend the dates of payment,
                            whereas second class of American claims would be subordinated to service
                            of international loan, costs of control, Reparation Commission, etc.,
                            and the future current costs of the Allies’ Armies. If this
                            understanding of your instruction be correct, it would mean that our
                            Army costs would enjoy an absolute priority on the proceeds of the
                            experts’ plan after the first 2 years. I do not feel that a priority of
                            that nature, if really intended, could be obtained; my feeling is that
                            the proper priority should be (1) service of the loan; (2) costs of
                            control, Reparation Commission, etc.; (3) then our Army costs to come
                            next and before current costs of the Allies; however, if it became
                            absolutely necessary we should be ready to place our past Army costs on
                            a parity with current Allied Army costs. Reparations and all other
                            treaty costs, our other claims included, would follow.</p>
                        <p>Also I am not quite clear from figures in paragraph 5, your L–81, June
                            14, 2 p.m., whether Department wishes to have included interest on
                            arrears at 4½ percent, as provided paragraph VII of [Army Costs
                            Agreement?]. I am inclined to feel that it is wholly desirable in new
                            negotiations that we waive questions of interest entirely and instead
                            ask merely for flat annual installments of capital amount, or ask for
                            interest only as a trading point.</p>
                        <p>2. In answer to paragraph 1 of your L–91, June 28, I have nothing to add
                            to my L–179, June 25, 7 p.m.</p>
                        <p>I agree that it is premature to make decision on acceptance of bonds
                            before we know exact nature of any proposal. I had in mind that time may
                            come when the Allies might offer us a considerable block of bonds in
                            satisfaction for all or a part of our Army costs with request that from
                            then on we look only to the bonds for satisfaction of this claim. It is
                            my feeling that if the Allies accept blocks of bonds, it is probably
                            desirable that we do the same, but I agree that this matter can
                            wait.</p>
                        <p>3. Your telegram, paragraph 8. By my remarks about ships I did not mean
                            to intimate that I expected any possible question on validity of title,
                            but merely that we were in stronger position by not relying on article
                            297 as source of our title, but by relying instead on our expropriation,
                            as article 297 bears more on the question of attribution of liquidated
                            proceeds. Article 44[<hi rend="italic">244?</hi>], annex 3 wholly
                            inapplicable to us because only ships that were German on January 10,
                            1920, covered. I am familiar with the Brazilian ships’ case and vessels
                            held by other South American powers. Bayne’s letter to which you refer
                            takes same position on source of title to our ships which I suggest. I
                            think that the niceties as to the origin of title may be forgotten. The
                            only question of practical importance is whether we <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0134"/>would permit a credit for value of
                            ships, and if so, when. I wish to understand clearly an important
                            declaration in your L–91, that if Government of the United States
                            retains German ships “due credit will be given therefor on American
                            claims against Germany.” The Allies will in this connection doubtless
                            point out that we have retained and have exercised full proprietary
                            rights over these ships for more than 7 years; and as there does not
                            seem to be any indication at present of return of the vessels the Allies
                            will be likely to inquire how much more time must elapse before the
                            ships shall be considered as retained.</p>
                        <p>To a degree, retention is a question of fact and Allies might from
                            practical viewpoint reasonably take the position that United States has
                            already retained the vessels in accordance with a definite expropriation
                            whereas other enemy property was and still is only sequestrated, and
                            they may ask why credit should not be computed forthwith. I should
                            appreciate further comment on the matter of credit, especially the time
                            thereof and whether on Army costs or on other claims.</p>
                        <p>4. In regard to subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of paragraph 8, I
                            agree that an effort should be made to obtain priority of American Army
                            costs over deliveries in kind, but I am not confident this priority will
                            be accorded. Should cash become inadequate there are other methods by
                            which our Army costs could be obtained without direct transfer into
                            foreign currencies; for example, acquisition by the Government of
                            commodities in Germany to be paid for out of special bank fund, or
                            financing out of this fund German purchases by American nationals who in
                            turn would pay Government of the United States in American currency.

                        <p>216. L–95, for Logan. Reference to your L–184, July 2, noon.</p>
                        <p>(1) Our Army costs may be subordinated to the service of the proposed
                            loan and, should it be necessary, to the costs of the Reparation
                            Commission and agencies of control, but they should rank ahead of the
                            Allied current Army costs. As the Army Costs Agreement by article II,
                            paragraph 3, recognizes that the American claim should rank ahead of
                            Allied current costs after January 1, 1927, I see no valid reason, in
                            view of the clear equity of our position, for the Allied contention that
                            their current Army costs rank ahead of or on <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0135"/>parity with unpaid American past Army costs after that
                            date. If the experts’ plan works, Germany’s payments would be increased
                            and the Allied costs would be reduced to such an extent that question
                            might not be of any great practical importance. American claims apart
                            from Army costs should rank equally with reparations and all other
                            treaty charges lumped together, and after the loan service, costs of
                            control, and accrued and current Army costs.</p>
                        <p>In regard to interest, article II, paragraph 7, of the Army Costs
                            Agreement properly recognized that this Government is entitled to
                            receive interest if there is delay beyond 1926 in payment of
                            installments agreed upon of a claim that even now is equitably
                            overdue.</p>
                        <p>Please cable Department if you believe that it is absolutely necessary to
                            be in position where some concession on these points be offered in order
                            to facilitate suitable arrangement providing for payment of claims.</p>
                        <p>(2) Your observations concerning ships will receive Department’s comment
                            later.</p>
                        <p>(3) Your paragraph 4. It is desired that you endeavor to obtain priority
                            of American Army costs payments over the cash amounts that are to be
                            allocated to cover deliveries in kind, restitution, clearings and
                            similar matters. This arrangement would be equitable for the reasons set
                            forth in Department’s telegram L–80, June 14, 1 p.m., especially
                            paragraph 3. If you are unable to obtain full priority for American Army
                            costs, then priority to be accorded in favor of these other charges
                            should be limited to a moderate amount, say,500,000,000 gold marks
                            annually.</p>
                        <p>(4) If it should not prove feasible to limit the suggested prior charges
                            to an amount approximating 350,000,000 [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] gold
                            marks as estimated in last part paragraph 3 of Department’s telegram
                            L–80, June 14, 1 p.m., which seems to depend principally on the
                            limitation of current Army costs to 240,000,000 gold marks a year, it is
                            obvious that payment of claims of the United States would not be made on
                            basis calculated in the last paragraph of Department’s L–81, June 14, 2
                            p.m. In this contingency the Government of the United States might be
                            compelled to ask for a larger percentage than that indicated. Refer
                            Department’s June 14, 1 p.m., paragraphs 8 and 11. While awaiting
                            assurances on reduction to an economical basis of costs of control and
                            current Army costs and also indication that the Allies are agreeable to
                            payment American claims along lines of Department’s June 14, 1 p.m., you
                            may, if you think it advisable for purposes of negotiation, ask at first
                            for a larger percentage than 2½ The Department recognizes the
                            advisability of making its demands as moderate as possible, but
                            obviously it does not desire to have to consider taking a percentage
                            smaller than that indicated.</p>

                            Associated Powers for war costs. Pursuant to the terms of the treaty

                            United States desires to reach an understanding with the Allied
                            Governments in order that its and their claims may be paid suitably.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States understands that the conference at
                            London is to deal with the measures to put the experts’ plan into effect
                            as speedily as possible, and that it is not proposed to examine
                            questions of apportionment among the Allied and Associated Powers to
                            which Germany is liable. This Government would, however, be glad to be
                            informed when and how it is proposed to consider apportionment in order
                            to be in position to indicate its views and appropriately to discuss the
                            question with the Governments concerned.</p>
                        <p>In the American claims there are included, first, the Army costs and, in
                            the second place, the other claims of this Government and the claims and
                            debts submitted for adjudication to the Mixed Claims Commission. As all
                            the signatory powers have not yet ratified the Army Costs Agreement of
                            May 25, 1923, it may be desirable to include suitable provision
                            concerning these Army costs in any new arrangement entered into
                            concerning apportionment of payments. It is unnecessary to dwell on the
                            special position of this claim and the importance which this Government
                            attaches to the payment of it at the earliest possible moment,
                            particularly as American Army costs have not been met while similar
                            costs of the Allies have been covered fully or substantially from past
                            German payments.</p>
                        <p>The total of the American claims of the second category comes to much
                            less than similar claims of the Allies. It should be borne in mind, in
                            this connection, that this Government, although under its treaty with
                            Germany it is entitled to assert claim under categories 5 to 7 of annex
                            I part VIII, of the Treaty of Versailles, has notified Germany that it
                            makes no claim under these heads. Clearly both the Government and
                            nationals of the United States are fairly entitled to be paid their
                            claims and debts on an equal footing with the <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0137"/>claims and debts of the Allies and Allies’ nationals,
                            as in equity they rank <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with these
                            claims and debts. Such payments to this Government, which would be
                            relatively small in amount, would, of course, form a part of “inclusive”
                            payments to which section XI, part I, of the experts’ report refers, and
                            as far as concerns transfer pursuant to the procedure contemplated in
                            annex 6 of the experts’ report would be on an equal footing with
                            payments to the Allies.</p>
                        <p>Obviously it is of importance that the Allies and the United States, in
                            seeking the payment of their just claims, should act in cooperation
                            instead of seeking payment separately with the possibility that
                            misunderstanding might follow.</p>
                        <p>(3) You will consult with Ambassadors Herrick and Kellogg, obtaining Mr.
                            Kellogg’s views by telegraph; and advise the Department as soon as
                            possible whether there are any suggestions which they and you have to
                            offer in the matter, or whether any objection is perceived to submitting
                            such a note at this time as the one proposed.</p>
                        <p>(4) Repeat to the Embassy in Great Britain as Department’s no. 186.</p>

                        <p>333. L–189, from Logan.</p>
                        <p>(1) Your L–96, July 5, 2 p.m. Regardful of delicate situation existing at
                            present between France and Great Britain, I feel that the Department
                            should proceed in the most guarded and moderate manner, lest the <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> proposed be regarded as another
                            bombshell, especially by French who are already in a sensitive mood and
                            who may feel that the additional charges upon the fund receivable from
                            Germany tends even further to make advantages of experts’ plan illusory
                            from purely French point of view.</p>
                        <p>(2) In my opinion any announcement that may be made should be brief, and
                            for that reason I feel that our own note is too legalistic and detailed,
                            and that it might with advantage be shortened.</p>
                        <p>In regard to your third paragraph, I venture a suggestion which may form
                            a basis for a draft; in particular I would not ask at present “when and
                            how it is proposed to consider apportionment.”</p>
                        <p>(3) At this juncture I believe that if the Department thought an
                            immediate <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> imperative, the following
                            text would serve best to accomplish our purpose; let excellent
                            argumentation of proposed <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0138"/>draft
                            in your L–96 be reserved for conference which considers

                                    possible and that it is not proposed to examine questions
                                    concerning the apportionment of the all-inclusive payments to be
                                    made by Germany as contemplated by the experts’ plan in
                                    satisfaction of the war claims of the Allied and Associated
                                    Powers.</p>
                                <p>The United States therefore does not desire at this time to raise
                                    the question of its equitable right, as a power associated in
                                    the Great War, to share, as contemplated by the experts’ plan,
                                    in an appropriate apportionment of the all-inclusive payments
                                    for the purpose of meeting its claims for Army costs and for
                                    damage[s to] person[s] and property.</p>
                                <p>The United States wishes to declare however that in seeking
                                    payment of its just claims from Germany it is willing to
                                    cooperate in the rehabilitation of Europe by acting through the
                                    machinery of the experts’ plan rather than to disturb the
                                    machinery by seeking payment outside the plan. It desires
                                    therefore to discuss the subject when the matter of
                                    apportionment hereafter arises for consideration.”</p>

                        <p>(4) I am consulting Ambassadors Herrick and Kellogg, and I urgently
                            recommend that in the meantime action on Department’s draft <hi rend="italic">note verbale</hi> as well as my alternative draft
                            above be suspended. I am hopeful that the somewhat disquieting situation
                            created when the terms of the British invitation to the Allied
                            Governments to the London Conference were revealed in the French press
                            will be adjusted satisfactorily by the MacDonald-Herriot conversations
                            in Paris.<note n="36" xml:id="d26fn36">On July 8 and 9.</note> The
                            situation created by the British note will, however, be reflected in the
                            London Conference, and it is my firm opinion that any note we should
                            send at this time ought to receive most thoughtful consideration, for in
                            event of any serious Anglo-French divergence of views which might arise
                            at conference our note will undoubtedly come into prominence, and
                            responsibility for any resulting failure of the conference might
                            improperly be laid at our door.</p>
                        <p>I understand through Ambassador Kellogg and from other sources that tacit
                            agreement already exists not to consider questions of distribution
                            during conference, and our position, therefore, appears secure. If Mr.
                            Kellogg can confirm this agreement, I believe our best ends will be
                            served by reserving all formal communications from our Government to the
                            Allies on subject of our claims until after London Conference, the
                            precaution being taken, however, of instructing Mr. Kellogg on attitude
                            to be taken if through any <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0139"/>possible breaking down of the agreement the questions were to come
                            before the conference. I am confident this latter procedure is more
                            businesslike and safer from whatever angle matter may be viewed.</p>

                        <p>336. The British Ambassador, who has just been at my house to see me,
                            tells me that the conversations between Herriot and Mac-Donald have been
                            very satisfactory and that the Prime Minister and Premier Herriot expect
                            their Parliaments to be satisfied with their explanations. Principal
                            obstacle to an agreement was question of who was to decide a German
                            default. Finally settled that they would leave it to an American,
                            presumably the Agent General, and Owen Young’s name was mentioned. I
                            gather, however, that they are somewhat perturbed lest you might not
                            agree to this solution, but sincerely hope you will find it possible to
                            do so, as it is the only one they have in sight.</p>

                        <p>241. I have read your L–96, July 5, 2 p.m., to Logan and Logan’s L–189,
                            of July 8 to you, and I am inclined to agree with him that until we know
                            more about the result of the conference at Paris yesterday it would be
                            better if note were withheld and, if question of payments by Germany is
                            raised, to notify the conference in session of our position. If,
                            however, you conclude to send the note and adopt form suggested by Logan
                            I think that conclusion is too indefinite as it merely states that our
                            Government is willing to cooperate with the Allies in seeking payment of
                            its just claims. In my opinion we should state that we expect to
                            participate in the discussion for the purpose of this payment. The
                            communiqué which was issued last night by the two Governments on the
                            Herriot-MacDonald conference is so vague that I shall try to see the
                            Foreign Office this morning and ascertain definitely if division of
                            proceeds is to be discussed at all. Shall wire you later.</p>

                        <p>The British and French Governments have agreed to submit to the Allied
                            Governments the following note, the conclusions of which they recommend
                            to their acceptance:—</p>
                        <p>1. In the minds of the British and French Governments the object of the
                            Conference which is to meet in London on July 16th is to arrange the
                            execution of the expert’s plan in so far as concerns the questions the
                            solution of which devolves upon the interested Governments:</p>
                        <p>2. The two Governments recognize the importance of the economic and
                            financial points of view and particularly the necessity of creating a
                            regime of confidence which gives the eventual lenders the necessary
                            sense of security, but they do not consider that this necessity is
                            incompatible with respect for the provisions of the Treaty of
                            Versailles; that is what the following considerations clearly establish.
                                <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0141"/>Even more, the violation of
                            these provisions would cause the disappearance, together with the
                            permanent basis of a peace established with such labour, of any
                            confidence in the solemn engagements of the nations and would be of such
                            a character as would not forestall but rather prepare new conflicts:</p>
                        <p>3. The experts were appointed by the Reparation Commission and invited by
                            that Commission on November 30, 1923, to “seek the means of balancing
                            the budget and the steps to be taken to stabilize the currency of
                            Germany”. The Reparation Commission has acted in the matter by virtue of
                            the powers it holds under the Treaty of Versailles and notably under
                            Article 234 which reads as follows: “The Reparation Commission shall
                            after May 1, 1921, from time to time, consider the resources and
                            capacity of Germany, and, after giving her representatives a just
                            opportunity to be heard, shall have discretion to extend the date, and
                            to modify the form of payments, such as are to be provided for in
                            accordance with Article 233.”</p>
                        <p>It is in order to enlighten itself in the exercise of these powers that
                            the Reparation Commission has consulted the Committees of experts
                            constituted under paragraph 7 of Annex II of Part VIII which reads as
                            follows: “The Commission is authorized to appoint all necessary
                            officers, agents and employees who may be required for the execution of
                            its functions, and to fix their remuneration; to constitute committees,
                            whose members need not necessarily be members of the Commission, and to
                            take all executive steps necessary for the purpose of discharging its
                            duties; and to delegate authority and discretion to officers, agents and
                            committees.”</p>
                        <p>4. The experts have submitted their reports to the Reparation Committee
                            which by a letter of April 17th, communicated them to the interested
                            Governments and informed them that the Commission had decided
                            unanimously. <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>As the Reparation Commission states certain of the measures to be taken
                            to put the plan of the experts into execution are within the sole
                            competence of the Governments. This view is moreover found <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0142"/>in the most explicit manner in the Dawes
                            Report of which paragraph 3 reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“If political guarantees and sanctions destined to ensure the
                                    execution of the plan proposed are considered desirable they do
                                    not come within the competence of the committee, neither do the
                                    terms of its mandate qualify it to examine questions of military
                                    occupation. We have however the duty of indicating clearly that
                                    our proposals are based on the supposition that the present
                                    measures in so far as they hinder this activity will be
                                    abandoned or modified to the necessary extent, as soon as
                                    Germany shall have put into execution the plan recommended, and
                                    that they shall not again be put into force except in case of
                                    flagrant default under the terms accepted by common agreement.
                                    In such a case it is clearly for the creditor governments,
                                    acting with the consciousness of their common responsibility in
                                    regard to their own financial interests and in regard to the
                                    private interests which shall have advanced funds for putting
                                    the plan into execution, to determine the nature of the
                                    sanctions to be applied and to organize them in such a way that
                                    they will be prompt and effective.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>5. It is therefore necessary that the creditor governments conclude an
                            arrangement by which they undertake to take such measures as are within
                            their competence to ensure the execution of the Dawes plan. The British
                            and French Governments declare that it is of the highest importance that
                            the report of the experts be put into effect without delay in order to
                            ensure the payment of reparation by Germany and to restore common action
                            by the Allies. With this object the two Governments have agreed on the
                            following points;— <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>

                                    Governments note with satisfaction that the United States of

                                    of the Dawes Report, an acceptance which they have already given
                                    individually to the Reparation Commission.</item>

                                    to the authority of the Reparation Commission but in
                                    consideration of the fact that guarantees ought to be given to
                                    the lenders who supply the 800 million gold marks and to the
                                    holders of obligations, the two Governments will unite their
                                    efforts in order to secure the presence of an American on the
                                    Reparation Commission in case the Reparation Commission shall
                                    have to declare a default on the part of Germany. If this
                                    solution should not be possible and in case the members of the
                                    Reparation Commission should not succeed in agreeing on an
                                    appreciation of the facts, the two Governments would recommend
                                    that the Commission should summon the Agent General of payments
                                    who ought to be of American nationality.</item>

                                    details by means of the various control bodies, but an important

                                    Germany’s good faith. In case the Reparation Commission should
                                    declare such a default, the interested governments will bind
                                    themselves to concert together immediately regarding the means

                        <p>6. The two Governments agree to refer to the examination of their legal
                            advisers any legal difficulty which may arise in the matter of the
                            interpretation of the present text.</p>
                        <p>7. The two Governments have had a preliminary exchange of views on the
                            question of the inter-allied debts; on this point the British Government
                            declared that it will seek, with the Governments interested, a fair
                            solution of this problem, taking into account all the elements which
                            affect it. This question is thus referred for a preliminary examination
                            to the Treasury experts.</p>
                        <p>8. The two Governments have also had a preliminary exchange of views on
                            the question of security; affirming to what point public opinion desires
                            complete pacification, they agree to seek the best means of attaining
                            this object, either by the intervention of the League of Nations, or by
                            any other way, and to continue the examination of the question until the
                            problem of the general security of the nations receives a definitive
                            solution.</p>

                        <p>206. Following for the Ambassador and Logan, for their information.</p>
                        <p>(1) Yesterday afternoon the French and British Chargés d’Affaires
                            communicated to the Secretary the text of the note drawn up by common
                            accord between the French and British Prime Ministers at their Paris
                            meeting for submission to the Allied Governments.<note n="40" xml:id="d32fn40">Note from the British Embassy, <ref target="#pg_46">p. 46</ref>.</note> After reading the note the Secretary stated
                            that it did not call for any reply by him, but that in order to avoid a
                            possible misapprehension he thought that he should call attention to the
                            fact that the Government of the United States could not appoint the
                            representative upon the Reparation Commission without consent of
                            Congress. <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0145"/>Although this
                            Government had privilege of appointing a representative under the
                            treaty, the Senate in consenting to the Treaty of Berlin had made
                            reservation that appointment should not be made unless Congress
                            approved. Congress does not convene until December, and it would be
                            wholly impracticable to have such an arrangement as an integral
                            provision of present plans of the Allies. This did not mean, the
                            Secretary explained, that some suitable alternative should not be
                            suggested; and he said he noted that in the identic note it had been
                            stated that if appointment on the Reparation Commission appeared to be
                            impossible, the French and British Governments would recommend that
                            commission call in the General Agent for reparation payments, who should
                            be an American. The French Chargé d’Affaires asked whether that would
                            require consent of Congress. The Secretary said he had merely referred
                            to an official appointment upon the Reparation Commission by the
                            Government of the United States; that reservation did not apply to
                            appointment of Agent for reparation payments under Dawes Plan, and that
                            he had no objection to appointment of an American to this position. Of
                            course if an American were appointed, the Secretary said, he supposed
                            that the Reparation Commission would avail itself of his opinion as far
                            as he was willing to give it; that would be another matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary was emphatic that he was not calling attention to this
                            point to raise any obstacle, but wholly to the contrary, in order that
                            no obstacle be created by misunderstanding of situation on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Please repeat to Ambassador Herrick for his information.</p>
                        <p>(2) Department assumes that text of the Anglo-French note is available to
                            you. If not, Department will cable it to you.</p>

                            <item>Your L–81, June 14, 2 p.m., in regard to amount of awards of Mixed
                                Claims Commission as probably about $300,000,000, and the fact that
                                this amount could be defrayed in about 24 years. Has the Department
                                taken into consideration fact that the awards of the Mixed Claims
                                Commission carry interest at rate of 5 percent from date of damage
                                done until date of payment? In other words, there <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0146"/>is an interest charge of $15,000,000
                                a year, and the sum suggested by Department as annual payment would
                                not be adequate to meet even this interest charge.</item>

                            <item>My purpose in bringing up the foregoing is not to suggest that we

                                everyone enters this sort of claim, however equitable it may be,
                                ultimate payment in full becomes practically hopeless; but I wish to
                                draw Department’s attention to the fact that interest runs on the
                                judgments for both parties. This fact may have been overlooked in
                                making calculations stated in your L–81. [Logan.]</item>

                            <item>Your L–195, July 13, noon, from London. The Department’s L–81,
                                June 14, 2 p.m., did not cover question of interest. <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0147"/>Department has been informed that
                                the date from which interest begins in awards of the Mixed Claims
                                Commission varies according to the category of the claim, in some
                                instances from the date of damage, in others from the Armistice.
                                Decisions to date, furthermore, relate only to some categories,
                                while others are expressly excepted for future consideration. The
                                Department is of the opinion, however, that it is wholly probable
                                that the commission in handing down its awards will provide payment
                                of interest at 5 percent up to the date of payment. This matter lies
                                outside the jurisdiction of the Department. As you will recall, 5
                                percent is the rate usually specified.</item>

                            <item>As stated in Department’s telegram June 28, 2 p.m., L–91, you may,
                                if you think it absolutely necessary, give the estimated award,
                                although as already indicated, the Department holds to the opinion
                                that we should avoid giving this figure, and the question of
                                interest is only one more reason in support of this view. Lacking
                                Congressional authorization, the Department would not be in a
                                position specifically to waive any portion of the amount to be
                                awarded by the Mixed Claims Commission, but if a detailed discussion
                                of the award is avoided, this point would not be raised, and the
                                Department could agree to accept definite percentage of German
                                payments as long as the Government of the United States is left free
                                to distribute its share in payments in accordance with its own
                                wishes.</item>

                            <item>To supplement statements paragraph 2, telegram L–80, June 14, 1
                                p.m., Department submits following in connection with view that to
                                present estimated amount of award would probably have prejudicial
                                effect on the percentage in German payments desired by this
                                Government. The amount of the American award will represent the
                                bottom figure with all inflation removed. No American claims under
                                categories of damages 5, 6 and 7 of annex I, part VIII, which cover
                                probably more than half of the claims of the Allies. The 132 billion
                                gold marks which has been established as the amount for which
                                Germany is liable includes damages from acts of her allies. The
                                amount of the American claims is, however, principally for acts of
                                Germany alone, as it is planned that claims of the United States
                                against Austria and Hungary will be presented to a separate
                                    tribunal.<note n="42" xml:id="d35fn42">See <ref target="frus1924v01#pg_142">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, pp. 142</ref> ff.</note> The basis for any final
                                distribution among the Allied Governments of Germany’s payments will
                                in all probability be the Spa Agreement, which was not based on
                                adjudicated claims of the several Governments, such as will be the
                                award to be handed down by the Mixed Claims Commission on American
                                claims against Germany.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>When the question comes up, it is not improbable that the Allies
                                might take position that the distribution of Germany’s payments <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0148"/>should be on <hi rend="italic">pro rata</hi> basis, each State to receive a
                                percentage representing ratio its claims bear to total claims of all
                                the Governments. Were the estimated amount of the American award to
                                be given, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to keep
                                before the Allied Governments the fact that proportionately this
                                amount was very much less than were the claims of these Governments.
                                The Department believes it preferable for this reason merely to give
                                the total of claims filed, which, not including Army costs, amount
                                approximately to one and a quarter billion dollars, and to state
                                that although it is thought that this amount will be materially
                                reduced in the award, yet inasmuch as the Mixed Claims Commission
                                has to the present reached decisions in comparatively small number
                                of cases only, it is not possible to indicate the precise amount of
                                the award. An indefinite statement such as that will leave this
                                Government much freer to insist on percentage it desires than it
                                would be were it to give an estimated figure of its total claim
                                reduced far below the figures on which claims of other Governments
                                to participation will be based.</item>

                        <p>314. (1) Conference has just circulated proposed resolution offered by
                            French delegation calling for a meeting of Financial Ministers of the

                            allocation of payments during first years of the operation of the Dawes

                            1923, a period to which pending Army Costs Agreement is applicable and
                            also include payments under Dawes Plan, the United States is interested

                            paragraph 2 of my 314. The Secretary replied to me to the effect that he
                            entirely approved the communication to the secretary general and saw no
                            objection to an early meeting at Paris to discuss question of

                        <p>339. This morning at a confidential meeting of the Prime Ministers and
                            first delegates, MacDonald asked me if I thought there were any <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0150"/>possibility that United States
                            would be represented at a conference on subject of inter-Allied debts. I
                            said that I thought not; that the subject of Allied debts to the United
                            States was one to be dealt with wholly by Congress, and that Congress
                            has passed a bill placing it in hands of a debt commission and fixing
                            terms and conditions of funding these debts. The Prime Minister said
                            that he quite understood the position, and subject was dropped. Allied
                            countries tentatively agreed that they would carry out program agreed
                            upon between MacDonald and Herriot in Paris to have their Finance
                            Ministers first meet and discuss subject and then have Allied conference
                            on subject later. It was also understood that there would be a
                            conference on subject of division of the German payments between the
                            Allied and Associated Powers, which they thought would be held in Paris
                            in October; an earlier date might, however, be agreed upon. I informed
                            everyone present, as I have before, that the United States would be
                            represented at this conference; no objection was raised. …</p>

                        <p>341. This morning I had a private conference with MacDonald. According to
                            his statements the British Treasury objects to French resolution calling
                            a Finance Ministers’ conference on division of German payments on ground
                            that France was trying to get British Government committed to reopening
                            Spa percentages and cutting down Great Britain’s proportion, or to allow
                            priorities to detriment of latter. MacDonald, unlike Snowden, wishes us
                            to be represented at conference of Finance Ministers. MacDonald did not
                            concede payment of our claims, but did concede our right to negotiate at
                            meeting of that sort. I am satisfied, nevertheless, that payment of our
                            general claims will meet opposition from British Treasury unless we can
                            extend both Army costs and general claims over sufficiently long period
                            to make annual payments attractive to Great Britain. In view of fact
                            that the Government of the United States will be included in the Finance
                            Ministers’ conference, Logan and I have <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0151"/>thought so far that it would be unwise to furnish the
                            Allied Governments with detailed memorandum on our position.<note n="47" xml:id="d39fn47">The memorandum mentioned in telegram no. 328, Aug.

                        <p>Both Logan and I felt that it should be reserved for the negotiation, as

                            after the finance meeting on Thursday. I should like to have the
                            Department’s views on this subject.</p>

                        <p>295. (1) The Department has noted from your recent telegrams that there
                            is some objection to the payment of our claims and that although the
                            Allies appear to be disposed to have this Government invited to the
                            finance meeting, they have not recognized in principle our right to
                            participate in payments under the Dawes Plan. The Department feels that
                            the Allied Governments should be committed to the principle of this
                            Government’s participation before the conclusion of the present
                            conference on the application of the Dawes Plan, but the Department
                            prefers to delay instructions until the Secretary’s return tomorrow
                            evening. If, however, there is likelihood that the conference will
                            conclude final agreement before you receive instructions, you are to
                            endeavor to postpone final conclusion until the Department has the
                            opportunity of instructing you after the Secretary’s return.</p>
                        <p>(2) If you are unable to have final conclusion postponed you may then
                            endeavor to obtain express recognition of the principle of this
                            Government’s participation in payments under the Dawes Plan. If
                            unsuccessful in this, then you should state that this Government would
                            not view with favor utilization by the Allies of German resources and
                            payments in such a manner as to prevent the full payment of American
                            Army costs and other claims.</p>

                        <p>345. (1) I wish to refer Department to previous communications from me
                            informing of MacDonald’s intention to exclude from conference any
                            discussion of division of German payments under Dawes Plan. French note
                            August 2 proposed meeting of Finance Ministers at early date for this
                            purpose and contained suggestions which the British felt to be
                            unacceptable; hence their proposal for an informal meeting to consider
                            the French proposal, the idea being that at this meeting satisfactory
                            terms of reference will be formulated. Our participation in this meeting
                            and in others is accepted.</p>
                        <p>I feel confident that this London Conference will undertake no
                            commitments regarding division of payments, and whole subject will be
                            left open for meeting of Finance Ministers. Of course I shall protest
                            any restriction in terms of reference which would militate against a
                            free discussion of our claims, but on the other hand a commitment in
                            favor of our claims is not probable. I can insist on participation in
                            the finance conference, but not on participation in division of payments
                            unless latter subject comes before me.</p>
                        <p>(2) If necessity should arise, I can make reserve and state that views of
                            my Government will be communicated to Allied Governments as soon as
                            possible. I have already given notification of our position to the
                            conference by my note of August 5 (see my telegram no. 314, the same
                            day) and again in oral statement on August 12. It does not seem to me
                            likely that the conference can be held together on this issue alone if
                            all other matters are finished, but in my opinion it is not likely that
                            business before the conference can be completed before Saturday at the
                                earliest.<note n="48" xml:id="d41fn48">The London Reparation

                        <p>(3) To inject a new and difficult issue at this critical moment might
                            disrupt conference and afford an opportunity to lay blame on the United

                            taking the matter up informally with the French Treasury sometime next
                            week, and hope to be in a position soon to let me know.</p>

                                        with making a preliminary inquiry into points later to be
                                        definitely decided by a financial conference, and with
                                        fixing agenda for such a conference. Sir Eyre Crowe states
                                        that this committee will be convened on October 14 at
                                        Paris.</item>

                                    <item>Crowe’s letter made definite reserve that British
                                        Government did not accept our point of view regarding our
                                        participation in all-inclusive Dawes annuity, as Ambassador
                                        Kellogg had outlined it at London Conference on August 12. I
                                        may here state my own view that it appears to me
                                        questionable whether the British Government is proper party
                                        to extend invitation to us to be present at conference in
                                        Paris, and I am fearful lest the Crowe example of making
                                        reservations be contagious. Following precedents, invitation
                                        should come from France. I do not think, moreover, that we
                                        should risk waiting for an invitation which makes reserves
                                        and to that extent places handicaps on us at the
                                        outset.</item>

                                    <item>My second reason is that, in fact, we have already been
                                        invited to the conference. By referring to minutes of London
                                        Conference for afternoon of August 12<note n="51" xml:id="d44fn51">Great Britain, Cmd. 2270, Miscellaneous
                                            No. 17 (1924), p. 70.</note> you will observe that
                                        French agreed to amend their resolution to include the
                                        “Associated Powers” and that the conference agreed that
                                        resolution should be referred to the “Allied Finance
                                        Ministers and the American representative.” Kellogg was
                                        formally advised of the resolution, and first meeting of the
                                        Finance Ministers and the American representative was
                                        actually called for 11 o’clock, August 14, to meet in the
                                        office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</item>

                                        canceled because of complications which arose in connection
                                        with the general conference, and two days later the whole

                            <item>For these reasons I feel that we have every technical basis for
                                assumption that we have been asked to participate in this conference
                                which is merely continuation of the meeting called in London and the
                                carrying out of the action referred to in London protocol (paragraph
                                E, article 4 of annex III). From point of view of policy I deem it
                                highly undesirable to wait until we receive invitations which <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0155"/>may be so laden with reserves
                                that our hands will be tied in advance and [garbled group]. I urge
                                Department’s prompt action on this recommendation so that we may
                                forestall creation of a position still more difficult than that
                                which is actually facing us. Sir Eyre Crowe’s letter, as I
                                understand it, only reserves British position at the small and
                                relatively unimportant preliminary committee meeting to which we are
                                invited to send an “observer.” I suggest that effect of this letter
                                be circumvented in your cable designating me as representative at
                                the financial conference by a statement that I have been authorized
                                to designate one or more of my assistants to attend meetings of such
                                committees as may be created in connection with work of finance

                        <p>322. L–128, for Logan. Your L–232, October 9, 6 p.m.</p>
                        <p>(1) The Department has notified the Principal Allied Governments that you
                            will represent the Government of the United States at the forthcoming
                            conference, and Ambassadors Kellogg and Herrick have been instructed to
                            give you copies of the communications made pursuant to the Department’s
                            instructions. The Department believes that these communications take
                            account of all the points raised in your helpful telegram.</p>
                        <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0157"/>
                        <p>(2) The Department does not know whether the preliminary meeting will be
                            held on October 14 as suggested by the British Government. In view of
                            the complicated questions which are to be considered in connection with
                            the distribution of annuities, it is Department’s opinion that the
                            preliminary meetings may, perhaps at the outset, not only raise the
                            major issues to be dealt with, but may also become the instrumentality
                            by which some of these measures will be threshed out. Should this happen
                            the Finance Ministers’ meeting, when it takes place, might do little
                            more than to ratify the plans which have been worked out by
                            representatives under instruction from their Governments. It seems to be
                            desirable, therefore, that you should personally attend opening meeting
                            which may conceivably lead to an issue in regard to question of American
                            participation in the proposed payments.</p>
                        <p>(3) Referring to desire expressed paragraph 3 of your L–229<note n="56a" xml:id="d47fn56a">Not printed.</note> that the Department send over
                            to assist you someone who is familiar with these matters, the Department
                            might find it possible to send someone later, in connection with the
                            Finance Ministers’ conference, or, if necessary, in connection with the
                            preliminary meetings, should the situation develop in such a manner as
                            to render action of this sort advisable. Of course, it is obvious that
                            no one could be sent in time for the first meeting, if that is held on
                            October 14.</p>

                            designate one or more of your assistants, the Department does not know
                            what persons you might properly designate to serve as this Government’s
                            representatives at preliminary meetings.</p>
                        <p>(40 The Department would like your comments on the above points as soon

                            following message received from French Government: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The British Government proposed to the interested Governments

                        <p>368. As an Associated Power the United States under article 259 of the
                            Treaty of Versailles and article 210 of the Treaty of St. Germain is
                            entitled to be consulted on disposition to be made of sums of Turkish
                            gold delivered by Austria and Germany under these treaty articles; see
                            Department’s instruction of July 16, 1923.<note n="57" xml:id="d49fn57">Not printed.</note> By article 58 of the Allies’ treaty with

                            reparation claims against Turkey. At the time that the Allies’ treaty
                            was negotiated the American representative at Lausanne made full
                            reservation of the rights of the United States.<note n="59" xml:id="d49fn59">Telegraphic instruction no. 210, June 30, 1923, to
                                mission at Lausanne; not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It is not believed that the United States has any beneficial interest in
                            this gold, but our consent is now asked to its delivery to the Allied
                            assessment commission (your despatch no. 45, January 29, 1924<note n="57" xml:id="d49fn60">Not printed.</note>), to be used in payment
                            Allied claims against Turkey. Department understands that gold amounts
                            to £5,000,000. The Government of the United States fully appreciates
                            fact that it has been consulted by Allied Governments, an inquiry in the
                            matter having been addressed to Mr. Whitehouse, Chargé in France, by the
                            secretariat general of the Conference of Ambassadors on October 20. This
                            fact may be a useful precedent in connection with other and more
                            important matters arising under the Treaty of Versailles. The question
                            is, however, whether the Government of the United States should at once
                            acquiesce in the delivery of the Turkish gold to the Allies in view of
                            Sir Eyre Crowe’s intimation that our right to participate in proceeds of
                            the Dawes Plan may be contested on some technical ground. The question
                            just now is not over any direct <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0159"/>relation between the two matters, but whether this Government should
                            facilitate the Allies in any of their dispositions if they are going to
                            take so inequitable a stand in regard to our claims. The right of the
                            United States to share in the proceeds of the Dawes Plan as provided in
                            the plan itself is believed to be sound legally; it is certainly most
                            equitable, as this Government has precisely the same right to be paid by
                            Germany as has any other of the victors and we are in reality presenting
                            claims for much less than we are entitled to present. If the Allies, as
                            intimated by Sir Eyre Crowe, should see fit to treat us so inequitably
                            as to attempt to contest our sharing on a proper basis in the proceeds
                            of the Dawes Plan, then it is a question whether we should in any way
                            facilitate the Allies in regard to consents for any purpose whatever. It
                            may be well for the British Foreign Office to understand that, should
                            they take such an inequitable position, they may, from now on, reckon
                            with our determined opposition in connection with anything they may
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the situation described above would afford you a
                            favorable opportunity to ascertain the attitude of the Foreign Office in
                            an informal and wholly personal interview, and to intimate what our
                            position will be. I should appreciate your frank opinion on this
                            suggestion. It seems to me that, should this Government in the course of
                            the next few weeks meet with opposition from the Allies, and especially
                            from the British Government, to its sharing in the proceeds of the Dawes
                            Plan, apparently we would have been in fact assisting those who give us
                            scant consideration in return. You will understand that this is not in
                            any way to demand a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for acquiescence
                            by this Government in the disposition of the Turkish gold. No <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> is desired, but merely fair
                            treatment in regard to the matters which are coming up under the Dawes
                            Plan and the Treaty of Versailles. You will remember that we also have
                            unsettled questions in regard to cables and to the British C mandates.
                            Should it become necessary to explain fully our relation to these
                            matters it is desirable that we should not be in a position where
                            apparently we have acquiesced in whatever was asked of us and then have
                            received no justice in connection with our claims. Suggestion made is
                            that you may have an opportunity to ascertain what the British propose
                            to do. It does not appear that we have anything to lose by having it
                            understood that no favors or consents of any kind and no facilitation of
                            any of their proceedings in the future can be expected from us unless
                            they deal fairly with us in regard to our claims.</p>

                        <p>(1) I should like to be advised of Department’s position on the following
                            subject which is likely to come up at financial conference for
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>(2) By article 232 of Treaty of Versailles, Germany assumes Belgium’s war
                            debt to the Allied and Associated Powers. Our pre-armistice claim
                            against Belgium together with accrued interest is understood to be
                            approximately $200,000,000. On June 16, 1919, President Wilson, Premier
                            Clemenceau, and Prime Minister Lloyd George signed a letter agreeing to
                            recommend, each to his own Government, the acceptance of German bonds in
                            satisfaction of Belgium’s obligation.<note n="61" xml:id="d50fn61"><p>Text of the letter printed in S. Doc. 413, 66th Cong., 3d

                                            to make reimbursement of all sums which Belgium has
                                            borrowed from the Allied and Associated Governments up
                                            to November 11, 1918, on account of the violation by
                                            Germany of the Treaty of 1839. As evidence of such an
                                            obligation Germany is to make a special issue of bonds

                        <p>(3) By the Finance Ministers’ Agreement of March 11, 1922,<note n="62" xml:id="d50fn62">See “Agreement between Great Britain, Belgium,
                                France, Italy and Japan respecting the Distribution of German
                                Reparation Payments.—Paris, March 11, 1922,” <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State Papers</hi>, 1922, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">cxvi</hi>, pp. 612 ff.</note> the United
                            States, France and Great Britain by article 10 were to receive a portion
                            of A B C bonds in satisfaction of their claims against <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0161"/>Belgium, the agreement as far as the
                            Government of the United States is concerned being subject to its
                            approval. The Belgians informally advise that they interpret this
                            agreement of March 11, 1922, to mean that Great Britain and France have
                            definitely abandoned any effort to require Germany to pay any sum for
                            Belgian debt in addition to the 132 billion gold marks total reparation
                            payment, accepting a special block of the ABC bonds instead.</p>
                        <p>(4) At the financial conference soon to be held I have been given
                            informally to understand that the Belgians will suggest that there be
                            set aside 5/137 or perhaps 5/132 of each annuity for the service of the
                            Belgian debt. In view of uncertainty of the future action of the United
                            States, it is probable that they will ask that portion that otherwise
                            would go to the United States should be paid to Belgium to be held by
                            that Government either for itself, if it has to pay the United States
                            directly, or as the trustee for the United States should our Government
                            decide to carry out unratified agreement of June 16, 1919.</p>
                        <p>(5) I assume that Department’s position is that Belgium still owes us the
                            debt, that we have not received it, and that we have not accepted
                            Germany’s liability in place of Belgium’s, but that we are not inclined
                            to press the claim at this time. If we were to accept Germany’s
                            liability, it would mean an additional claim against her of 800,000,000
                            gold marks.</p>
                        <p>(6) From, the Belgian point of view it is undesirable that we formally
                            state our position at the conference should question arise, for Belgians
                            fear that should United States say at the outset that payment is
                            expected, Great Britain and France may say in view of changed conditions
                            that Finance Ministers’ Agreement of March 11 is not binding on them
                            either, especially as it has never been ratified by French Parliament.
                            It is desirable from our point of view, of course, to aid the Belgians
                            as much as possible, as we shall need their help in obtaining
                            recognition of our right to participate in the Dawes Plan annuities.
                            Should question arise it seems that it would be better to say that we
                            are studying matter, that we are aware of equities of Belgium’s
                            position, that this Government is not inclined to press for payment
                            while general situation is under consideration, and that in meantime we
                            would prefer that France and Great Britain go ahead as if we had no
                            connection whatever with matter.</p>
                        <p>(7) I shall appreciate Department’s advice if it is not in accord with
                            the foregoing statement of facts and suggestion. Logan.</p>

                        <p>442. Your 368, October 21, 6 p.m. and 369, October 21, 7 p.m.<note n="63" xml:id="d51fn63">Latter not printed.</note> I had a conference with
                            Sir Eyre Crowe and explained in detail our claims for costs of Army of
                            Occupation and reparations and reasons for our participation in German
                            payments under the Dawes Plan. I said, in view of the attitude of Mr.
                            Snowden at the conference and the statement of Crowe made to me in his

                            grounds upon which we based our right to participate, I felt I should
                            have an informal and frank discussion of the whole subject with the
                            Foreign Office. He said he was glad to discuss the matter with me. I
                            think he understood our position perfectly.</p>
                        <p>He said however he understood there were some legal objections that the
                            Treasury had raised; that under the Versailles Treaty the reparations of
                            the Allied and Associated Powers were made a prior charge on Germany;
                            that the Reparation Commission was the sole body empowered to receive
                            reparations; that the Reparation Commission had notified Germany of the
                            total amount of their claims but did not include ours as we did not
                            ratify the treaty or come into the adjustment and that therefore
                            technically we could not make a separate treaty and make our claims
                            preferred claims over those of the Allies or <hi rend="italic">pari
                                passu</hi> with them.</p>
                        <p>I said I did not think his position well taken. In the first place the
                            United States Government as a participant in the war was entitled on
                            equitable grounds to reparations. In the second place if the Allied
                            Governments agreed to present participation Germany could not object. He
                            said of course this was true and if the Governments agreed it could be
                            adjusted. In the third place I told him that Germany and a part of the
                            Allied and Associated Governments could not agree between themselves
                            that their claims should be a prior charge on the revenues of Germany as
                            against the claims of the United States. He did not claim this objection
                            applied to our Army costs as that was provided for by the Armistice
                            Agreement but he thought the whole matter of our claims was a subject
                            for an agreement as there had been an agreement of the Army costs. He
                            did not commit his Government as to what adjustment they would make but
                            said he would talk the matter over with his Treasury and <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0163"/>discuss it further with me. He supposed
                            the experts at Paris would not settle it. It would be settled by the
                            several Governments. He further said that he understood there was a
                            further question about the ships taken from Germany. They were divided
                            among Allies in a certain proportion according to their losses and all
                            ships over a certain amount were paid for by the several Governments to
                            the Reparations Commission; that the United States had not come into
                            this adjustment. He said he was not at all clear about this point. What
                            is your understanding as to this?</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation I mentioned the subject of the Turkish
                            gold, explained the situation and said in that case the Allied
                            Governments had asked our consent for the disposition of the gold to the
                            Allies, thus they had conceded our interest. I did not make this a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> for the adjustment of our
                            reparations claims but told him I could see no reason why we should
                            consent to turn over this property to the Allied Governments if we were
                            not permitted to participate in the German payments. He did not comment
                            upon this but I think he grasped the point.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the Mesopotamian mandates he was not posted but said
                            there was no intention of discriminating against American interests nor
                            that monopolies should be granted. He was inclined to think the
                            resolution referred to in your number 369 (which I did not show him)
                            took the place of the original mandate. Article 11 of the treaty of
                            alliance contains a clause against discrimination. He promised to give
                            me full information on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Will write Logan and keep him fully advised.</p>

                        <p>472. L–243, from Logan.</p>
                        <p>(1) The first meeting of the experts convened Monday, October 27, and
                            additional meetings were held Tuesday and Wednesday. To date questions
                            discussed relate almost exclusively to adjustment Ruhr occupation
                            accounts, a matter which in my opinion it is best for us to keep out of.
                            We have had representatives at these meetings with listening brief
                            exclusively, for purpose of keeping me advised in regard to developments
                            and general attitude. Had I attended these meetings personally the
                            question of our claims would <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0164"/>have
                            been precipitated immediately. It is my opinion that general atmosphere
                            this week is not one of the best for presentation of our position. I
                            shall attend the meetings of the expert committee in the first part of
                            next week and shall then intimate as much of our claims position as may
                            be advisable before the actual meeting of the Finance Ministers.</p>
                        <p>(2) Last week I had a conversation with Herriot and Clémentel<note n="65" xml:id="d52fn65">M. Etienne Clémentel, French Minister of
                                Finance.</note> before whom I set forth the general lines of our
                            claims. Both assured me that French support could be counted on provided
                            that our annual charge on German all-inclusive annuity were kept within
                            reasonable limits. I informed them that annual charge for both American
                            Army costs and claims could probably be brought to a figure not varying
                            greatly from annual charges already provided by Agreement of May 25,
                            1923, for Army costs alone, although necessarily for longer period. They
                            told me that settlement on this basis was substantially all they wanted
                            and that French delegates, therefore, would support our position at the
                            conference. From what Ambassador Kellogg writes me, I expect British
                            opposition which may have to be handled through diplomatic channels. I
                            shall keep in close touch with Kellogg, who will undoubtedly be in a
                            position to aid.</p>
                        <p>The Italian position is not clear, but I do not expect difficulties
                            unless the Italians should line up with the British. It would help if
                            the position of the Italian Finance Minister at the conference were
                            sounded out through the American Embassy in Italy, and if it were
                            ascertained to be unsympathetic a little pressure through diplomatic
                            channels might materially aid our negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(3) It is Clémentel’s opinion that the actual meeting of the Finance
                            Ministers will not be before the latter part of November at
                            earliest.</p>
                        <p>(4) Referring to query in paragraph 3 of Department’s L–128, October 11,
                            6 p.m. When Finance Ministers’ conference does convene I shall need
                            legal assistance. Because of general reorganization of the Reparation
                            Commission I shall be left without legal assistance, and for that reason
                            I request Department to send someone here to act as my assistant,
                            someone, preferably, with legal training, who speaks French and has a
                            knowledge of the Department’s attitude on questions at issue.</p>
                        <p>(5) I have been indisposed for a few days but will be out of doctor’s
                            care tomorrow. Logan.</p>

                            <item>Position of this Government on Belgian debt referred to in article
                                232, Treaty of Versailles, remains unchanged. As this question is a
                                matter of debts and is, therefore, within competency of Debt
                                Commission under existing law, it is quite distinct from the Dawes
                                Plan annuities, and Department does not feel that this question
                                should be brought into the forthcoming conference. As this
                                Government is not a party to the Finance Ministers’ Agreement of
                                March 11, 1922, the question remains one between United States and
                                Belgium. Even statement referring to “equities of Belgium’s
                                position” might be construed by Belgian Government as indicating
                                that Government of the United States is preparing to change its
                                position in matter. A further reason, moreover, for not permitting
                                question to be introduced in discussions is that precedent for
                                linking debt question with our claims for just and moderate
                                participation under Dawes Plan might be thought to be
                                established.</item>

                            <item>The Department possesses information which indicates that Belgium,
                                besides neglecting its obligation to reimburse this Government from
                                reparation receipts, has discriminated against the United States by
                                making large payments to Great Britain on relief indebtedness
                                without making corresponding payments to this Government as is
                                required by existing agreements. You will be given details later. Of
                                course you will not discuss this matter with the Belgians until you
                                are instructed.</item>

                                claims, the possible Belgian suggestion you outline in latter part
                                your paragraph 4 does not appear directly to concern this
                                Government. If American claims are suitably met, the Government of
                                the United States will not be disposed to question arrangements made
                                by Allies for apportionment of Dawes Plan annuities to cover
                                appropriately their own claims against Germany and against one
                                another.</item>

                                forthcoming financial conference in every possible way. Department
                                has no reason to feel, however, that Belgium would not be prepared
                                to take position similar to position French Government is prepared
                                to take (refer your L–243, October 30, 6 p.m.), which is most
                                gratifying to Department. We presume that if you deem it advisable
                                and <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0166"/>have a suitable

                                with the Belgian representatives. They may well follow French in the

                                on article 232 at the conference unless our views are asked. If
                                anything is to be said besides outlining this Government’s position
                                as set forth in paragraph 1 above, the Department will instruct you
                                later in light of Treasury’s views on matter referred to paragraph 2
                                above. On this latter point, Department will advise you further as

                            <item>Referring to suggestion at end paragraph 2 your L–243, regarding
                                Italian position, it might be better not to take any action looking
                                toward raising any question with Italians at this time, as it
                                appears possible that they might in some manner seek to associate
                                question of their support with question of intergovernmental debts.
                                The Department is, however, instructing our Ambassador to report
                                promptly to Department and also to you and Ambassador Kellogg any
                                information which reaches him on Italy’s attitude, but not to make

                        <p>386. L–143, for Logan. The Department has just been consulted by J. P.
                            Morgan and Company on the proposed French $100,000,000 loan which the
                            firm is considering bringing out shortly if the Department sees no
                            objection to it. The bankers’ negotiations, which have been under way
                            for some time, have been awaiting consummation of the German loan. The
                            bankers have also taken the position that they would not bring out the
                            proposed French loan until France had balanced her budget. On the basis
                            of the Herriot government’s budget, which the bankers feel is likely to
                            be accepted, they now appear inclined to proceed.</p>
                        <p>Other questions aside and apart from the position of the Department of
                            Commerce and the Treasury, both of which I am now about to consult, I
                            should certainly oppose flotation of a French loan in the United States
                            were there any doubt of France’s support at the forth-coming <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0167"/>Finance Ministers’ conference, and I
                            have already intimated as much to the bankers confidentially. From your
                            telegram of October 30, L–243, I gather that Herriot and Clémentel are
                            committed to support of the position of the United States. The
                            Department does not desire to raise this question in such a manner as to
                            give needless offense, but it must not take the risk of failing to make
                            good the just claims of this Government. This matter is of such
                            importance that you are authorized to communicate informally on this
                            point with Herriot or Clémentel and to obtain definite assurance of
                            French support of our claim for participation in the Dawes Plan
                            annuities substantially on the basis you outline in your L–243.</p>
                        <p>I am communicating the foregoing to our Ambassador in Great Britain,
                            confidentially, and am suggesting to him that he seek earliest favorable
                            opportunity to ascertain position of Prime Minister or of Austen
                                Chamberlain<note n="66a" xml:id="d54fn66a">British Secretary of
                                State for Foreign Affairs.</note> on payment of American claims.</p>
                        <p>Telegraph reply as well as any comment on the foregoing and related
                            questions as soon as possible, for the bankers will await the
                            Department’s answer.</p>

                            wise to present the matter to Austen Chamberlain first and then say to
                            him that should it be necessary for the Prime Minister to consider it I
                            should like to have the opportunity of presenting it to him. To proceed
                            otherwise might make Chamberlain think that I had gone over his head. I

                            the Dawes report was after careful consideration embodied for the
                            purpose of making every type of claims of the Allied and Associated

                        <p>493. L–247, from Logan. Department’s L–143, November 11, 5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>1. Before I approach Herriot and Clémentel I should like to have
                            Department’s views and instructions on following formula for French
                            position: French Government freely to recognize equitable right of the
                            United States to participate in Dawes annuities; France and the United
                            States were allies in the Great War, both suffered damages and losses
                            and are entitled to settlement from the common enemy; both incurred army
                            costs in the Rhineland. The United States did not ratify the Treaty of
                            Versailles but signed peace treaty with Germany in which the United
                            States reserved and Germany granted same rights and privileges as those
                            to which the United States would have been entitled under the Treaty of
                            Versailles. On reparation account, the United States, unlike the Allied
                            Governments, makes no claims for pensions or family allowances but only
                            for actual damages done to private citizens and property. Dawes
                            annuities represent total of the payment to be made by Germany for war
                            costs for many years to come and unless the United States receives <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0169"/>some payment from these annuities
                            no payment at all will be received; French Government believes that it
                            would be highly inequitable if the United States could not satisfy its
                            just claims and French Government freely agrees to American
                            participation in distribution of the Dawes annuities. Modality of that
                            distribution is matter for consideration by Finance Ministers’
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>Before talking with Herriot and Clémentel it is best, in my judgment, to
                            have some definite approved formula to suggest which can be reduced to
                            writing and signed by either of them and in my possession before our
                            Government’s position on the French loan is announced definitely. I feel
                            that a formula along the lines suggested in paragraph above meets the
                            situation and in all probability would have the support of the French
                            Government. I should be grateful to have approval as soon as possible or
                            receive instructions for modifications.</p>
                        <p>2. I am not expecting any difficulty from Belgium in supporting the
                            formula on the lines proposed, but I expect there will be British
                            opposition and I am not altogether sure of the Italians. I feel,
                            however, that if I get French and Belgian approval to formula,
                            announcement of which in the press this week I can arrange with the
                            French and the Belgians, we can win over the Italians and probably the
                            British. The latter, I think, would hesitate on account of public
                            opinion to oppose a thesis that is so preeminently equitable and that
                            carries with it Belgian and French indorsement. The formula once
                            adopted, the field for our settlement eventually would be cleared.</p>
                        <p>3. Was ill recently but am now attending expert committee, though I have
                            not taken any active part as questions of principle have not yet arisen.
                            I shall soon be forced to take a positive position. Repeating telegram
                            to Brussels and London. Logan.</p>

                        <p>389. L–144, for Logan. Your L–247, November 12, 4 p.m. I agree that it
                            will be highly desirable to procure formula as you have suggested. You
                            should, however, omit the sentence which reads: “The Dawes annuities
                            represent total of the payment to be made by Germany for war costs for
                            many years to come and unless the United States receives some payment
                            from these annuities no payment at all will be received.” It is
                            considered unwise to raise any question whether United States could
                            obtain payment outside of participation <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0170"/>in the Dawes Plan annuities. For the above sentence
                            substitute the following: “Dawes Plan with its comprehensive provisions
                            for payment by Germany of war costs specifically contemplates
                            participation by United States in payments made under the plan.”</p>

                        <p>418. Your no. 467, November 12. I quite concur in your seeing Chamberlain
                            first if you think it preferable to do so, and I see no objection to
                            your leaving memorandum with him along lines you suggest if you deem it
                            advisable. …</p>
                        <p>In regard to Owen Young’s letter it appears to me to be unwise to raise
                            any question as to whether the United States could be paid outside of
                            participation in annuities provided under Dawes Plan, as to do this
                            would bring up questions of alien property, etc. Department does not
                            desire to take position which would support assertion of waiver of
                            eventual claim against German Government or that Germany by agreeing to
                            Dawes Plan has made “suitable provision” referred to in Knox resolution
                            which was incorporated in our treaty with Germany. It is advisable that
                            this Government avoid commitment on these points. Nevertheless, in
                            connection with your conversations, Young’s statement as to intent of
                            section 11 may well be effective. Probably preferable to use portion of
                            letter which alludes to purpose to cover our claims.</p>

                        <p>512. L–255, from Logan.</p>
                        <p>(1) Referring to our technical position at the coming finance conference.
                            While it is obviously advisable to stand on broad equitable ground, do
                            we not also have the legal answer to Allied position on section 11 of
                            the Dawes Plan to the effect that London Conference, which formally
                            accepted plan, thereby altered Treaty of Versailles to that extent and
                            put everyone on a parity, just as the Versailles Treaty was amended in
                            other respects, such as the extension of the period for deliveries of
                            dyestuffs, creation of transfer committee, etc.?</p>
                        <p>The answer to the suggestion that the word “Associated” was inadvertently
                            included in the experts’ report last April is that the London Conference
                            unanimously accepted the text without change on August 16 after our
                            claims position had been notified officially to the conference by
                            Ambassador Kellogg’s note of August 5.<note n="73" xml:id="d60fn73">See
                                telegram no. 314, Aug. 5, from the Ambassador in Great Britain, <ref target="#pg_54">p. 54</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>(2) By the Allies’ own argument our treaty gives us at least a second
                            mortgage on assets of Germany. Under London protocol, can a third party,
                            so to speak, seize principal part of these assets without considering
                            second mortgagee’s rights? The seizure is especially apparent in regard
                            to railway system and assigned agents.</p>
                        <p>(3) While I agree that the broad basis of equity is the strongest, I do
                            not think that we should permit the Allies to take the position that
                            they have all the legal rights and that we have none, so that any
                            concessions which might be made, might, from their point of view, be
                            regarded as something in the nature of a courtesy.</p>
                        <p>(4) Telegram repeated to Embassy in London with request for expression of
                            Kellogg’s views for benefit of this office and the Department.

                        <p>483. Logan’s telegram L–255 to Department, November 17. In general I
                            agree with Mr. Logan’s first proposition in regard to use <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0172"/>of words “Associated Powers.” Besides
                            statement made by Owen Young and very evident purpose [of section 11?],
                            it is fact that London Conference by the protocol accepted it without
                            change and with full knowledge not only of our assertion of right to
                            participate in conference but of our assertion of right to obtain share
                            of payments for satisfaction of both classes of our claims, and the
                            plenary conference recognized it by adoption of first committee’s
                            report.</p>
                        <p>I think that our legal position should be fully stated. The Dawes Plan
                            was not only supplemental to and in application of Treaty of Versailles
                            for collection of reparations, but superseded that treaty in many
                            respects, such as extension of period for delivery of dye-stuffs, the
                            activities of the transfer committee, arbitration in regard to decision
                            of Reparation Commission on default, etc. The Dawes Plan provided for
                            means of payment of reparations not only under Treaty of Versailles but
                            under our treaty of 1921 with Germany which was made and ratified before
                            Dawes report and was fully known both to Dawes committee and London
                            Conference. Only hesitancy I have in calling it an amendment to Treaty
                            of Versailles is feeling it might affect attitude of the French whose
                            representatives in the London Conference were very insistent that they
                            neither would nor could amend that treaty. They did not assert, however,
                            that Dawes report and London protocol were not additional remedies and
                            to some extent changed the powers existing under Treaty of
                            Versailles.</p>

                        <p>484. Yesterday afternoon I set forth fully to Mr. Chamberlain and Sir
                            Eyre Crowe both legal and equitable grounds for position of the
                            Government of the United States on its claims for Army costs and
                            reparations. Mr. Chamberlain stated in reply that the question was one
                            on which by its nature he must consult his colleague the Chancellor of
                            the Exchequer, but that he would like to make a few general remarks.</p>
                        <p>First, Mr. Chamberlain said that there was no question in dispute between
                            the British and the American Governments over justice of American claims
                            for Army costs, but that advancement of reparations claims had come to
                            him as great surprise. He then read extract from your New Haven address,
                            November, 1922,<note n="76" xml:id="d62fn76"><ref target="frus1922v02#pg_199"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1922, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p.
                                    199</ref>.</note> to effect that the American Government had a
                            claim for Army costs but did not ask reparations payments from Germany.
                            I replied that I believed you had in mind general reparations and not
                            compensation for damages to the persons and property of American
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>Second, he referred to my assertion that the members of the Dawes
                            committee intentionally inserted phrase “Allied and Associated Powers”
                            in order that the Government of the United States should be protected in
                            both categories in all claims. He stated as fact that no matter what was
                            intention of the American members of the committee, the British members
                            had no knowledge that the so-called reparations claims of American
                            Government were envisaged by that clause. Had they been aware of that
                            construction, the British experts would certainly have stated to the
                            committee that question of the claims was <hi rend="italic">ultra
                                vires</hi>, and that it was a matter to be referred to British
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I said that at beginning of the London Conference I had fully informed
                            British, Belgian, French, and Italian Governments of our position, and
                            had placed it on record in the conference both in writing and orally;
                            and that the conference had adopted the protocol with full knowledge of
                            our claims.</p>
                        <p>Third, Mr. Chamberlain said that while he did not agree with our
                            contentions put forward on a legal basis, he thought they would receive
                            favorable consideration on an equitable basis and that matter was one
                            for adjustment; that he was prepared to appeal to Chancellor <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0174"/>of the Exchequer on that basis; he would
                            like to be able to say to Mr. Churchill, however, that if claims of the
                            American Government were to be allowed, we would pool in Reparation
                            Commission with Allied Governments the fruits of the common victory;
                            that if the American Government was to receive reparations it should
                            give credit for alien property seized, especially ships, as the Allies
                            had done. I asked Mr. Chamberlain what the Allies had done. Neither he
                            nor Sir Eyre Crowe were able to tell me definitely. But Mr. Chamberlain
                            promised to furnish me with memorandum in reply to memorandum I left
                            with him going into matter in detail; he said he thought that Germany
                            had indemnified German nationals for property taken by Great Britain,
                            and that Great Britain had indemnified British nationals for property
                            taken by Germany. Sums had been offset and balance settled between the
                            two Governments. Crowe said that shipping had been pooled among the
                            Allies and that all tonnage above certain percentage of losses was to be
                            paid for to Reparation Commission by each Government. He was indefinite
                            about details, and of course I declined to make any commitment and said
                            I should report to you what he had said. I pointed out that Germany may
                            have indemnified and paid her nationals for property taken by Great
                            Britain, but that she had not done this with us. He said that there
                            would be no objection to doing this, unless it would require shipment of
                            gold out of Germany, and I suggested that it would. I also pointed out
                            that United States had not put forward class of claims which Allied
                            Governments had presented but Crowe asserted that they did not expect to
                            receive anything on those general claims, beyond compensation for
                            damages to persons and property.</p>
                        <p>I should like to be informed in detail of your attitude and position in
                            regard to ships and alien property.</p>
                        <p>I am to see Chamberlain again this afternoon and shall cable you further
                            tonight. Copy of telegram sent Logan.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Logan informed M. Clémentel that he had come to see him to
                                explain the position of the United States in the matter of their
                                claims against Germany and of their right to participate in the
                                Dawes annuities. Mr. Logan explained that the claims of the United
                                States were of two kinds; (1) the costs of the Armies of Occupation,
                                and (2) the claims for damages to persons and property. He stated
                                that the United States Government believed it had an equitable and
                                legal right to participate in the Dawes annuities, and that it hoped
                                to have the aid of France in this matter at the forthcoming
                                Conference of Finance Ministers. For M. Clémentel’s confidential
                                information, Mr. Logan expressed the opinion that an arrangement
                                could probably be reached for the annual amount payable on these two
                                classes of claims to the United States which would not greatly
                                surpass the annual obligations already stipulated in the Wadsworth
                                agreement on costs of the Army of Occupation, although the annual
                                payments would nevertheless be spread over a longer period.</p>
                            <p>M. Clémentel stated that the French Government was favorable to
                                American participation in the Dawes annuities, but that the legal
                                advisers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were of the opinion that
                                the strictly legal position resulting from the treaties did not
                                constitute a basis for the American claims.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Logan, on the contrary, deemed that the United States had a legal
                                right to participate in the Dawes annuities but that his Government
                                was disposed to avoid if possible technical discussions of law and
                                to stand on the general basis of equity.</p>
                            <p>M. Clémentel replied that although the French Government thought its
                                legal point of view to be well-founded, nevertheless, for general
                                reasons of equity, that Government was favorable to participation
                                    <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0176"/>of the United States in
                                the Dawes annuities with a view to the settlement of the claims
                                formulated. He asked that the American position be explained in
                                detail.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Logan stated that France and the United States had been allied
                                during the war and that both had suffered damages and other losses
                                which ought to be compensated by the common enemy. Both had incurred
                                expenses for the occupation on the Rhine. Although the United States
                                had not signed the Treaty of Versailles, it had signed a treaty in
                                which Germany had accorded it the rights, privileges, and advantages
                                to which the United States would have been entitled by virtue of the
                                Treaty of Versailles. As the Dawes annuities represented the total
                                payments to be effected by Germany it seemed only just and necessary
                                that the United States should participate in them; Mr. Logan
                                observed that the United States was formulating no claim for
                                pensions or allowances to families.</p>
                            <p>M. Clémentel reiterated that on the general principle of equity the
                                French Government was ready to admit the justice and necessity of
                                American participation in the Dawes annuities from the outset of the
                                execution of the plan, and to adopt this point of view. The French
                                Government was not holding to technical points of law raised by its
                                legal advisers (and not admitted by the Government of the United
                                States), thus giving a new proof of the friendship existing between
                                the two Republics. Naturally the importance of the participation and
                                the details of its application are reserved and would be the object
                                of discussion at the Conference of Finance Ministers. After having
                                conferred with M. Herriot, M. Clémentel was able to state that the
                                French Government would support the merits of the American cause set
                                forth by Mr. Logan, with the sole reservation that the French
                                Government believed that the service of this claim, the importance
                                and modalities of which would be fixed by the conference, should not
                                in any event be assured at a more rapid rate than the service of the
                                French claim of the same kind.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Logan thanked M. Clémentel for his friendly attitude and stated
                                that he would communicate the assurance of the French Government to
                                the Secretary of State. For his own part, he was very happy to note
                                that M. Clémentel agreed that the United States should participate
                                in the Dawes annuities from the outset of the execution of the plan.
                                Inasmuch as for the first year of the plan there would not be, in
                                practice, any payment effected outside of Germany, he thought it
                                very probable that his Government would not ask any participation
                                for the first year. The observation formulated by M. Clémentel,
                                namely, that the claims of the United States would be paid at a rate
                                similar to that of French claims of the same kind, seemed a just and
                                reasonable proposition. As M. Clémentel had observed, the importance
                                of the American participation and <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0177"/>the details of its application were a subject for
                                discussion by the Conference of Finance Ministers and Mr. Logan
                                remained convinced that this conference, when it would have to
                                consider the questions of priority and percentages, would doubtless
                                recognize that the costs of the American Army of Occupation,
                                according to the terms of the treaties as well as by virtue of the
                                provisions of the pending Wadsworth Agreement, were entitled to a
                                priority, and would accord moreover some consideration to the fact
                                that the other claims of the United States contained no amount
                                whatever for pensions or for allowances to families—a detail which
                                would reduce materially the total of their claims in comparison with
                                those of the other powers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Clémentel observed that in his opinion these questions were
                                within the competency of the Conference of Finance Ministers.</p>

                            <head><hi rend="italic">Memorandum Sent to Mr. Logan by Mr. Gutt,
                                    November 19, 1924</hi></head>
                            <p>The Belgian Government freely recognizes the equitable right of the
                                United States to participate in the Dawes annuities. Belgium and the
                                United States were allied in the Great War. Both suffered damages
                                and other losses and are entitled to a settlement from the common
                                enemy. Both have incurred expenses of occupation on the Rhine. The
                                United States has not ratified the Treaty of Versailles, but it has
                                signed a treaty of peace with Germany in which it has reserved and
                                Germany has accorded to it the same rights and privileges to which
                                the United States would have been entitled by virtue of the Treaty
                                of Versailles. On reparations account the United States, unlike the
                                Allied Governments, presents no claim for pensions <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0178"/>or for allowances to families, but
                                simply for actual damages to individuals and to property. The Dawes
                                Plan with its concise and definite stipulations for the payment of
                                the costs of the war by Germany looks to the participation of the
                                United States in the payments effected by virtue of this plan.
                                Accordingly, the Belgian Government considers that it would be
                                wholly contrary to equity if the United States were unable to obtain
                                satisfaction for its just claims, and the Belgian Government
                                willingly agrees to American participation in the distribution of
                                the Dawes annuities. The modalities of this distribution are subject
                                to the Conference of Finance Ministers, in which the United States
                                will be represented on an equal footing with the other powers.</p>

                            received Logan’s L–260, contained in Paris Embassy’s No. 523, November
                            22nd, 2 p.m.,<note n="82" xml:id="d64fn82">Not printed.</note> to the

                            submit to the Committee of Experts, and asking my comments. I wired you
                            today, stating that I approved it; that it is substantially the same as
                            the one I presented to Chamberlain (copies of which are enclosed
                            herewith), except that I quoted Section 2 of the Resolution of Congress,
                            and Articles I and II of the Berlin Treaty, so that Chamberlain would
                            have them before him; and except that in my Memorandum, page eight, I
                            said in substance that I did not believe any technical objection could
                            be made on the ground that under the Versailles Treaty the reparations
                            were to be collected solely by and through the Reparations Commission.
                            Sir Eyre Crowe had suggested this as an objection. I said that part of
                            the Allied and Associated Powers could not provide for an exclusive
                            remedy.</p>

                            Logan and asked his views. I have already told him I could see no reason
                            why he should not present it to the Experts Committee with any additions
                            he saw fit. There are some minor changes, but in substance you will see
                            the two memoranda present the same points.</p>

                        <p>In Section XI, Part One, of the Dawes Report, it is provided that

                                    decide must legitimately remain a definitive charge on the

                        <p>These provisions were most carefully considered by the Dawes Committee.
                            They were intended to make all claims of every name and nature of the
                            Allied and Associated Powers against Germany a charge on the funds in
                            the hands of the Agent General. The Dawes Report was accepted by Germany
                            and by all the Allied Governments by the final Protocol of the London
                            Conference, and has been put in force. The Conference was fully aware of
                            the nature of the American claims for Army costs and reparations. On
                            August second, the French Delegation presented to the Conference a
                            Resolution, <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0180"/>calling a meeting of
                            Finance Ministers to meet in Paris immediately after the close of the
                            Conference, for the purpose of allocating the payments made by Germany
                            since January 1, 1923, and also the allocation of German payments as
                            from the date when the Agent General for Reparation Payments takes up
                            his duty and during the first years of the operation of the Dawes Plan.
                            On August fifth, I sent a letter to the Secretary General of the
                            Interallied Conference, setting forth the nature of the American claims
                            and our right as an Associated Power under the Dawes Plan to be
                            represented at said conference and to participate in such distribution.

                        <p>The French Resolution and my letter to the Conference on behalf of the
                            United States came up for consideration on Tuesday, August twelfth,
                            1924, at which time I explained to the Plenary Conference the nature of
                            the American claims and our right to be represented at such a Conference
                            and to have the American claims paid out of the funds to be paid into
                            the Bank by Germany for the benefit of the Allied and Associated Powers.
                            After discussion, it was agreed that the United States should be
                            represented and that notice should be sent out accordingly. (See <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the London Reparations Conference</hi>,
                            Vol. I, page 49).<note n="85" xml:id="d65fn85">See <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 80.</note> Furthermore, the American position is
                            in entire harmony with the Report of the Second Committee approved by
                            the Plenary Conference on July 28, 1924, which provides in Article 4,
                            sub-division <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, that “with the resources thus
                            placed at his disposal, the Agent General for Reparation Payments shall
                            provide for the payments of reparations and other Treaty charges during
                            the transition period in accordance with the decisions as to
                            distribution which will be taken by the Allied and Associated
                            Governments.” This was intended by the Conference to include the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The United States has two classes of claims against Germany: Costs for
                            the maintenance of its Army of Occupation and claims for damages to
                            persons and property.</p>
                        <p>The basis of the claims for Army Costs is America’s participation in the
                            war, the Armistice Agreement, the United States Treaty with Germany, and
                            the Agreement of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers made May 25,
                            1923, for the payment of these sums. In <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0181"/>Article IX of the Armistice Agreement of November 11,
                            1918, signed by Germany and among others by the United States, this
                            provision appears “The maintenance of the troops of occupation in the
                            Rhine-land shall be defrayed by the German Government.”</p>
                        <p>In view of the payments made to the Allies by Germany in the global sums
                            handed over to them, of which no part was paid to the United States for
                            its Army costs, and on the theory of our equitable right in view of
                            services rendered to the Allies by the maintenance of our Army on the
                            Rhine, thereby reducing their own expenditures, there was signed at
                            Paris on May 25, 1923, an Agreement with the Principal Allied Powers for
                            the adjustment and payment of these army costs. This agreement has not
                            yet been ratified by France, nor the ratifications exchanged. Roughly,
                            that Agreement provides that our army costs of 255 million dollars (on
                            which there have been some small credits) would be divided into twelve
                            annual instalments, and should be, during the first four of the twelve
                            years, a first charge on cash payments received from Germany, or for
                            Germany’s account, after the expenses of the Reparation Commission and
                            the current expenses of the Allied armies of occupation have been
                            satisfied, but during the last eight years be an absolute prior charge
                            on all cash payments, except for the costs of the Reparation Commission.
                            Furthermore, the Allies agreed that they would apply the value of
                            deliveries in kind to the discharge of their army costs. No sums have
                            been paid to the United States under this Agreement regarding army costs
                            except that Belgium has deposited in a separate account for the benefit
                            of the United States twenty-five per cent of certain reparation payments
                            amounting to about eleven million dollars.<note n="86" xml:id="d65fn86">See <ref target="#pg_140">pp. 140</ref> ff.</note></p>

                        <p>Aside from the legal right to participate in the payments by Germany to

                            the United States and Germany which I will hereafter consider, I believe
                            the United States is entitled to participate on broad equitable grounds.
                            It was the Associated Power in the war. It contributed very materially
                            to the victory. It incurred large expense by the maintenance of its Army
                            of Occupation which has been recognized by the Allied Governments in the
                            Army Cost Agreement. It has just claims of reparation for damages to
                            persons and property of its citizens, recognized and agreed to by the
                            German Government and ranking <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the
                            claims of the Allied countries engaged in the war. I shall not enlarge
                            upon this point, as all the facts and circumstances are well known to
                            His Majesty’s Government. But I submit that on technical legal grounds
                            the right of the United States is incontestable. It is true the United
                            States did not sign the Versailles Treaty. This can make no difference
                            whatever so far as the costs of the Army of Occupation are concerned, as
                            this is provided for by the Armistice Agreement which was signed by the
                            United States. But beyond this, the failure to ratify the Treaty of
                            Versailles did not take from the United States the right to indemnity
                            from Germany for losses and damages suffered by its citizens, the same
                            class of claims as those which are being collected by the Allies. It
                            will be noticed that by the Berlin Treaty between Germany and the United
                            States, Germany undertakes to accord to the United States, and the
                            United States shall have and enjoy all the rights, privileges,
                            indemnities, reparations or advantages specified in the Joint Resolution
                            of Congress, including all rights and advantages stipulated for the
                            benefit of the United States in the Treaty of Versailles, which the
                            United States shall fully enjoy notwithstanding the fact that such
                            Treaty has not been ratified. With a view of more particularly defining
                            the obligations of Germany, it is further provided that the rights and
                            advantages stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles for the benefit of the
                            United States, which it is intended the United States shall have and
                            enjoy, are those defined in certain sections of the Treaty, including
                            the reparations section heretofore referred to.</p>
                        <p>It has been suggested that technical objections might be raised by some
                            of the Allied Powers. Certainly no suggestion has been made that Germany
                            could object. But it has been said that under the <pb n="90" xml:id="pg_90" facs="0184"/>Versailles Treaty the reparations of the
                            Allied and Associated Powers were provided for and made a prior charge
                            on Germany; that these reparations were to be collected by the
                            Reparations Commission; that the Reparations Commission notified Germany
                            of the total amount of claims which did not include those of the United
                            States; and therefore the United States could not by separate treaty
                            claim the right to share in this preference <hi rend="italic">pari
                                passu</hi> with the Allies. I submit that these claims for
                            reparations arose on account of the war in which the United States
                            participated, and not by virtue of the Treaty of Versailles.
                            Furthermore, I do not believe it lies in the power of Germany and a part
                            of the Allied countries to enter into a Treaty which would exclude the
                            balance of the Allies in the war from collecting reparations or make the
                            reparations of a part of the countries a first charge against Germany,
                            unless the other countries engaged in the war agreed to such a
                            preference. Could France enter into a separate treaty with Germany,
                            making its reparations claims and army costs a prior charge on German
                            revenues, thereby excluding Great Britain and the other Allies? If not,
                            neither could the Allied Powers make such an agreement which would
                            exclude the “Associated Power.” Nor do I believe there can be any
                            technical objection to the participation of the United States because
                            the reparations were to be collected solely by and through the
                            Reparations Commission. Likewise, a part of the Allied and Associated
                            Powers could not provide an exclusive remedy for the collection of
                            reparations by the balance of the Powers engaged in the war. The Dawes
                            Report recognizes this and provides that the payments made by Germany to
                            the Bank shall include all claims of the Allied and Associated Powers
                            and this agreement has been accepted and put in force by the Protocol
                            signed by Germany and all the Allied Powers.</p>
                        <p>The amount of the Army claims has been fixed, although there are some
                            small credits to be made. But on the basis of 255 million dollars, to be
                            paid in twelve annual instalments, it would take about 21 million
                            dollars per year. However, by the agreement unpaid annuities accumulate
                            and if not paid before, must all be paid during the last eight years. In
                            fact unpaid annuities have accumulated, and probably will accumulate
                            during the first two years of the Dawes Plan. Assuming therefore the
                            ratification of the Army Cost Agreement, virtually all of the total sum
                            would have to be paid in the last eight years, namely, 32 million
                            dollars per annum. It is the desire of the United States to facilitate
                            in every way the settlement of the reparations question and therefore it
                            is willing to recast the Army Cost Agreement and to make an extension of
                            the time of payments, <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0185"/>provided a
                            reasonable percentage of the money paid into the Bank for reparations is
                            also allowed on its general claims. The amount of the American claims
                            cannot now be definitely stated. But we are satisfied that an
                            arrangement can be made whereby the total annual payment to the United
                            States for army costs and claims will not much exceed if at all the
                            annual payments necessary to fulfill the present Army Cost Agreement. We
                            believe the American claims for damages to persons and property should
                            rank <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the reparations claims of
                            other countries. The Army costs are of course a prior charge.</p>

                        <p>433. Your 484, November 20, noon. As you said, I had reference in my New
                            Haven speech to general reparations.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s attitude on ships and alien property was set forth at
                            length in its instructions to Logan L–91, paragraph 8, June 28, and
                            L–99, July 7.<note n="89" xml:id="d66fn89">Latter not printed.</note>
                            Instructions are being sent to Logan to furnish you copies of these
                            instructions. Briefly they are that each of the Allied Governments was,
                            under the Treaty of Versailles, given option of retaining or releasing
                            enemy property. Some of the Allies if not all have released a part at
                            least while retaining the balance. The Government of the United States
                            must be fully as free to exercise its option to release or to retain as
                            any of the others. If the German property seized in the United States or
                            the proceeds are finally retained, due credit will be given of course
                            against our claims against Germany.</p>
                        <p>It appears probable from every indication including statements made in
                            reports of Congressional committees on alien property that Congress
                            would not be disposed to approve final retention of such property. This
                            Government ought to have complete liberty to retain or to release this
                            property in view of the elimination of categories for pensions,
                            allowances, etc., and of our willingness to extend payments from the
                            proceeds of the Dawes Plan over a long series of years with consequent
                            relatively small annual participation.</p>

                            <item>At experts’ meeting this morning I made the simple oral statement
                                that the Government of the United States had two general claims
                                against Germany, namely, claims for damages to persons and property,
                                and pre-war debts; that it anticipated the concurrence of the
                                interested Governments in securing satisfaction to these claims
                                through the Dawes Plan annuities. I emphasized the belief that our
                                right to this participation in the Dawes annuities was so obviously
                                sound from the points of view of both law and equity that I did not
                                anticipate any denial of such recognition from the interested
                                Governments. I added that a detailed statement of the ground on
                                which we based our claims would seem unnecessary at this
                                time.</item>

                            <item>The French and Belgian representatives then stated that regardless
                                of the legal bases of our claim on which they reserved their
                                Governments’ [position, they?] were prepared to fully support our
                                position on the grounds of equity.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The Italian representative stated that he personally supported our
                                position on equitable grounds, but that he had no instructions from
                                his Government. [Paraphrase.] He told me privately yesterday that he
                                had been informed from Rome that the Italian Government could not
                                support our position on legal grounds and that he was without
                                instructions in regard to support from point of view of equity. He
                                acknowledged his personal support after I had summarized our
                                position, and he said he would communicate to his Government the
                                broad grounds of our position with recommendation that they be
                                considered favorably.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Japanese delegate remarked that though personally he supported our
                                position he also was without instructions from Japanese Government.
                                After the meeting I told him privately I should be glad to give him
                                orally expose of broad grounds of American position. I shall do this
                                this afternoon. He had promised to ask his Government for immediate
                                instructions. [End paraphrase.]</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>British representative remarked that he had no information to
                                support our position either from an equitable or a legal basis but
                                he felt before the British Government would give its approval the
                                committee of experts should be fully informed of the figure and
                                details of our claims. I replied that before giving any figures or
                                details <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0187"/>whatever it seemed to
                                me that the question of principle should be settled, that until such
                                [was] established it would be futile to discuss details. I proposed
                                therefore that the committee adjourn until the British
                                representative could be instructed by his Government, since no
                                useful purpose [could be?] served by the committee until the British
                                attitude in this respect [were] known. The British representative
                                replied that he regretted this proposal since it would involve a
                                delay. I replied that any delay would be due to the failure of the
                                British Government to reach a decision. He agreed to my proposal and
                                the committee adjourned.</item>

                                I am not wholly satisfied with Italian stand and am hoping
                                Department will be able to find some means of strengthening

                            <item>On the whole I am pleased with today’s developments. Because of
                                firm and unequivocal support of both the French and the Belgians I
                                feel almost certain the British will ultimately come into line. The
                                press in both France and Belgium is beginning to show interest in
                                the proceedings of the committee and to comment favorably on our
                                position. Undoubtedly there will be some leakage of the proceedings
                                of this morning’s committee meeting which I feel may be helpful in
                                getting our position recognized by British.</item>

                        <p>The Department has noted with surprise the statement regarding Italian
                            representative’s position, in view of statement of Secretary General of
                            Italian Foreign Office reported by you.</p>
                        <p>You will take first opportunity that offers to see Secretary General and
                            intimate importance this Government attaches to recognition of its just
                            claims. Refer to his earlier conversation on this subject; state that
                            you understand that question is now under consideration in Paris and
                            express hope that appropriate instructions <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0188"/>have been sent Italian representative at Paris to
                            support American position. It might be helpful, in this connection, to
                            remark that French and Belgian Governments are giving us their firm and
                            unequivocal support.</p>

                        <p>424. L–158, for Logan. Your L–255, November 17. My feeling is that your
                            first suggestion in regard to alteration of Treaty of Versailles by the
                            London protocol contains elements of danger. This Government did not
                            sign protocol and to that extent is not in same position as Allies.
                            Legal position of this Government is based on provisions of the
                            Armistice, Treaty of Versailles, resolutions of Congress approved July
                            2, 1921, ending state of war with Germany, and Treaty of Berlin, August
                            25, 1921. Although we offer no objections to the modification of the
                            Treaty of Versailles not deemed incompatible with our interests, we can
                            not admit that any rights acquired by this Government by treaty or
                            otherwise can in any way be diminished or altered by an agreement
                            between the Allies and Germany to which the Government of the United
                            States is not a party and to terms of which it has not consented.</p>
                        <p>The points you make on significance of the word “Associated” are well
                            taken and should answer conclusively any allegation of its inadvertent
                            inclusion. You will recall in this connection Department’s telegram
                            L–50, February 23,<note n="92" xml:id="d69fn92"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_1">p. 1</ref>.</note> and your
                            L–112, of March 22.<note n="93" xml:id="d69fn93"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_10">p. 10</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Legal position of this Government is sound, and I am unwilling even to
                            imply that our rights are only those of second mortgagee. From
                            Ambassador Kellogg’s telegram of November 20,<note n="94" xml:id="d69fn94"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_77">p. 77</ref>.</note> which he repeated to you, I note that he
                            shares my views on this point.</p>
                        <p>I am in agreement with you that we should stress our legal rights
                            wherever possible and avoid appearance of resting our case wholly on
                            equitable grounds, although we should of course always maintain the
                            latter with due prominence.</p>

                                    explanation of the views of the United States Government
                                    regarding their participation in the payments to be made by
                                    Germany under the Dawes Plan.</p>
                                <p>2. In that memorandum Your Excellency explains the reasons which,
                                    in the opinion of your Government, justify this demand. They
                                    divide their claims against Germany into two classes: (1) costs
                                    for the maintenance of the American Army of Occupation; (2)
                                    claims for damages to persons and property.</p>

                                    repeated to you the assurance already given to you verbally on
                                    the 27th October by Sir E. Crowe<note n="99" xml:id="d72fn99">See telegram no. 442, Oct. 28, 5 p.m., from the Ambassador

                                    that, so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, the

                                    has already been disposed of. An agreement regulating that
                                    question was signed on the 25th of May 1923,<note n="1" xml:id="d72fn1"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_180"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 180</ref>.</note> as
                                    Your Excellency records in your memorandum under reply, between
                                    the United States and the Principal Allied Powers. That
                                    agreement has since been ratified, and the principle at stake
                                    has thus been finally settled so far as this country is
                                    concerned. His Majesty’s Government consequently do not
                                    anticipate any difficulties as regards that matter.</p>
                                <p>4. As to the second claim advanced by Your Excellency—that for
                                    damages to persons and property—His Majesty’s Government
                                    understand from your memorandum that it is based not only on
                                    treaty rights, but also upon a passage in the Dawes report and
                                    upon grounds of common equity. It is with sincere regret that,
                                    as regards the legal position which Your Excellency seeks to
                                    establish, His Majesty’s Government are unable to see eye to eye
                                    with the American Government.</p>
                                <p>5. It is due to the United States Government that I should state
                                    the view taken by His Majesty’s Government of the legal
                                    position. They are unable to agree that Germany had it in her
                                    power by her later treaty with the United States of America to
                                    alter or vary the obligations that by the earlier Treaty of
                                    Versailles she had already contracted towards the powers which
                                    ratified that treaty. The contention, <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0191"/>as I understand it, is that Germany, by the
                                    separate treaty with the United States of America, has
                                    undertaken to accord to the United States all the rights and
                                    advantages stipulated for the benefit of the United States in
                                    the Treaty of Versailles (including the reparation section of
                                    that treaty) notwithstanding the fact that such treaty has not
                                    been ratified by the United States.</p>
                                <p>His Majesty’s Government are, however, advised that this
                                    stipulation covers undertakings which Germany had not the power
                                    to give in view of previous obligations which she had incurred
                                    under the Treaty of Versailles. By article 248 of that treaty
                                    Germany constituted the reparation obligations a first charge
                                    upon all her assets, and she therefore was not in a legal
                                    position to incur any fresh obligations towards another power
                                    which had not ratified the treaty, if the effect would be to
                                    diminish the resources available for reparation to the Allied
                                    Powers which had ratified.</p>
                                <p>6. His Majesty’s Government are unable to agree that the report
                                    of the Dawes committee could alter this legal position. The
                                    Dawes committee was appointed by the Reparation Commission
                                    (which derives its authority with regard to Germany from the
                                    Treaty of Versailles alone) to ‘consider the means of balancing
                                    the (German) budget and the measures to be taken to stabilize
                                    the currency.’ Any question as to the states which were to share
                                    in the reparation payments, or as to the proportions of the
                                    share of each, was clearly outside the scope of the committee’s
                                    functions.</p>
                                <p>7. I need not repeat to Your Excellency that I do not for one
                                    moment dispute the explanation which you were good enough to
                                    give me of the intentions which caused your Government to
                                    instruct the American member of the Dawes committee to introduce
                                    the words ‘and Associated Powers’ into the committee’s report.
                                    Your Excellency must, however, allow me to say on my part that,
                                    if the United States Government understood the passage to have
                                    been inserted for the express purpose of placing on record a
                                    formal recognition of their claim to a share of the Dawes
                                    annuities, this was certainly not so understood by the British
                                    members of the Dawes committee. Indeed, I am informed that the
                                    matter was never discussed in this sense either in the full
                                    committee or in the drafting committee when the text of the
                                    report was under preparation, nor during the proceedings of the
                                    second committee of the recent London Conference, to whose
                                    report reference is made on the third page of Your Excellency’s
                                    note.</p>
                                <p>8. I should add that, under the terms of the Treaty of
                                    Versailles, the amount of the damage for which compensation was
                                    to be made by Germany was left to be determined by the
                                    Reparation Commission. For the purpose of carrying out their
                                    task in this respect, the commission had to take into account
                                    the various claims put forward by the several Allied
                                    Governments. At no time, so far as His Majesty’s Government are
                                    aware, did the American Government during the discussions that
                                    then took place, either within the commission or outside it,
                                    make any intimation that they wished to put forward a claim for
                                    inclusion in the total to be demanded from Germany. Nor does any
                                    reservation appear to have been made by any American
                                    representative, official or unofficial, of any possible future
                                    right of America to make such claim. The American Government
                                    were represented at the conferences held at Spa in 1920 with the
                                    object of <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0192"/>arriving at an
                                    agreement concerning the proportion in which the amount of
                                    reparations, when received, should be divided between the states
                                    entitled to share in the reparations. There is no record of any
                                    attempt having been made on the part of the American
                                    representatives, either on that occasion or since, to claim a
                                    percentage in the allotment then being laid down amongst
                                    themselves by the Allies for the distribution of German
                                    reparation payments when received. Nor did this create any
                                    surprise among the Allied Governments, since it had become
                                    generally understood that the United States Government made a
                                    special point of not demanding reparations from the powers
                                    defeated in the war. In that belief His Majesty’s Government
                                    were strongly confirmed when, in a speech at New Haven on the
                                    29th of December, 1922, of which the American Secretary of State
                                    caused the text most courteously, though informally, to be
                                    communicated to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington, the
                                    American Secretary of State used the following words: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘The crux of the European situation lies in the
                                            settlement of reparations. There will be no adjustment
                                            of other needs, however pressing, until a definite and
                                            accepted basis for the discharge of reparation claims
                                            has been fixed. It is futile to attempt to erect any
                                            economic structure in Europe until the foundation is
                                            laid.</p>
                                        <p>How can the United States help in this matter? We are not
                                            seeking reparations. We are, indeed, asking for the
                                            reimbursements of the costs of our Army of Occupation;
                                            and with good reason, for we have maintained our Army in
                                            Europe at the request of the Allies and of Germany, and
                                            under an agreement that its costs, with like Army costs,
                                            should be a first charge upon the amounts paid by
                                            Germany. Others have been paid and we have not been
                                            paid.</p>
                                        <p>But we are not seeking general reparations. We are
                                            bearing our own burden and, through our loans, a large
                                            part of Europe’s burden in addition. No demands of ours
                                            stand in the way of a proper settlement of the
                                            reparation question.’</p>
                                    </quote></p>
                                <p>It was in these circumstances, as I had the honour verbally to
                                    explain to Your Excellency, that, not having hitherto doubted
                                    that these words still correctly describe the policy of the
                                    American Government, the intimation that they now claimed a
                                    share in the Dawes annuities in respect of reparations, and
                                    apart from the cost of the Army of Occupation, came upon His
                                    Majesty’s Government as a complete surprise.</p>
                                <p>9. I have felt it to be due to Your Excellency and to the
                                    Government of the United States of America that I should explain
                                    thus fully the grounds on which His Majesty’s Government are
                                    unable to admit the legal arguments brought forward in Your
                                    Excellency’s memorandum. There remains the question of equity
                                    raised in Your Excellency’s memorandum. His Majesty’s Government
                                    understand that the United States Government has under its
                                    control very large sums arising from German property in the
                                    United States analogous to the property which, under the terms
                                    of the Versailles Treaty, has been used in Allied countries to
                                    meet private claims arising out of the war. Under the treaty any
                                    credit balance in favour of Germany resulting from dealing with
                                    German property is reckoned as a credit to Germany in the
                                    reparation account. Further, there are certain sums in respect
                                    of ships, retained by the United States in excess of their
                                    tonnage losses which should be accountable to the pool. His
                                    Majesty’s Government have no definite information as to the
                                    amount of these sums, but they have always understood that they
                                    are likely <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0193"/>to be equal or
                                    nearly equal, to the amounts awarded by the Mixed
                                    Commission.</p>
                                <p>10. His Majesty’s Government are naturally anxious to give the
                                    fullest and most friendly consideration to any claim put forward
                                    by the United States Government. Though, therefore, for the
                                    reasons given above, they find it difficult to see how the
                                    present claim could be sustained, they would be quite willing to
                                    examine the whole matter in connection with the forthcoming
                                    meeting of Finance Ministers in Paris if the United States
                                    Government would supply them with a statement of any further
                                    grounds on which it appears to them that the claim can be
                                    maintained and would inform them what the amount of the claim
                                    actually is, and whether, in the event of the claim being
                                    conceded, the United States Government is prepared to agree to
                                    set off against it, as other powers have done under the Treaty
                                    of Versailles, any credit balance arising from dealing with
                                    German assets which have come into their hands, and to have the
                                    net claim fixed as under the treaty by the Reparation Commission
                                    and made subject to the same reductions, owing to the
                                    reductions, past or prospective, of German payments, as applied
                                    to countries claiming under the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
                                <p>11. The United States Government will no doubt recognize the
                                    fairness of their undertaking the same obligations under this
                                    head as are binding on the Allies. If the matter is to be
                                    considered from the general point of view of equity, the
                                    propriety of such equality of benefit from, and of corresponding
                                    contribution to, the common fund can hardly be questioned. It
                                    would accordingly be of real advantage in forming a judgment on
                                    the practical issue raised by the American claim, if approximate
                                    figures as to the net amount involved could be furnished. If in
                                    return Your Excellency desires an exact statement of the
                                    obligations of the Allies in this matter, I shall be happy to
                                    obtain it for you from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or it
                                    may be explained to the American representatives at the meeting
                                    of Finance Ministers at Paris.</p>
                                <p>12. The actual details of any arrangement that may ultimately
                                    prove possible must necessarily stand over until the forthcoming
                                    meeting of the Finance Ministers in Paris. This, as Your
                                    Excellency is probably aware, can no longer take place at the
                                    beginning of December, as His Majesty’s Government had hoped.
                                    But, irksome though this delay may be in some respects, it has
                                    at least this advantage—that it will give longer time to
                                    consider, in all their aspects, the questions Your Excellency
                                    has raised. I should mention that the Dominions’ interest in
                                    reparations! would, in any case, require us to consult them,
                                    through such representatives as they may appoint, before
                                    arriving at any new decisions.</p>
                                <p>13. In closing this communication I feel it is unnecessary to
                                    assure Your Excellency that nothing is further from my thoughts,
                                    and that nothing would be more distasteful to His Majesty’s
                                    Government than to engage in a fruitless controversy over a
                                    matter of this kind with the United States Government, of whose
                                    services to the common cause, both during and since the war, the
                                    British people are, and always will be, fully appreciative. At
                                    the same time, His Majesty’s Government would be guilty of a
                                    breach of trust were they not also to safeguard to the best of
                                    their ability the legitimate <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0194"/>interests of the British taxpayers, who are
                                    already bearing so large a share of the burdens inherited from
                                    the war, burdens which they have loyally shouldered and never by
                                    word or deed sought to evade, as Your Excellency will be the
                                    first to admit. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government
                                    hesitates so readily to accept the suggestions now put forward
                                    by the United States Government as others, less heavily
                                    burdened, may already have done, it will not, I feel convinced,
                                    be imputed to any ill-will on their part.</p>
                                <p>I have the honor to be with the highest consideration Your
                                    Excellency’s obedient servant. Signed Austen Chamberlain.”</p>

                        <p>Chamberlain gone to Rome. Will not return until December 14th. From copy
                            of memorandum I left with him and mailed to you<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_85">p.
                                    85</ref>.</note> you will see many of his points were answered
                            in advance, but I think further answer should be made.</p>
                        <p>Chamberlain’s point 5. The position that Germany had no power to make a
                            treaty with the United States to pay damages to American nationals is
                            trivial. There is no obligation, express or implied, in the Versailles
                            Treaty that incapacitated Germany to pay the United States the separate
                            damages to her nationals accruing on account of the war; and no power in
                            the Allied Governments and Germany to make their reparations a first
                            charge. The damages to nationals of the different powers were not joint
                            but separate and arose out of the war, not out of the Versailles
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Point 6. While the Dawes committee was appointed by the Reparations
                            Commission, its report went beyond the Versailles Treaty; was not only
                            in aid of that treaty for the purpose of collecting reparations, but in
                            many respects superseded it, notably in the extension of period for the
                            delivery of dyestuffs, activities of the transfer committee,
                            arbitration, stabilization of currency, organization of bank and many
                            other things. It was adopted by a treaty signed by all the Allied
                            Governments and is as binding as the Versailles Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Point 7. Owen Young states there is no reason for [this statement?]. We
                            might get another letter from him leaving out the statement that if
                            Germany made the payments to the bank, she was discharged from all
                            claims of the Allied and Associated Powers. (See my 467, November 12, 4
                            p.m.) Furthermore before the Dawes report was approved by the London
                            protocol I notified Great Britain and the other nations individually and
                            also the plenary conference as a whole of the position of the United
                            States. The protocol was signed with full knowledge of this.</p>
                        <p>Point 8. Manifestly the Allies and Germany had no power to agree that the
                            separate claims for damages by American nationals should be fixed by the
                            Reparations Commission. There is no reason <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0195"/>why the American Government should have notified the
                            British Government or the Reparations Commission or the Spa Conference
                            of its claims because it was left free to deal with Germany as it saw
                            fit and not until the Dawes report was adopted with its provisions for
                            all-inclusive payments was there any reason for the United States
                            Government to notify the Allied Governments that we expect to share in
                            the payments to the Agent General. I have already explained to
                            Chamberlain but it would be well to put in writing that in your New
                            Haven speech you referred to general reparations and not damages to
                            persons and property which were then in process of being adjusted with
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>Points 9 to 13. In reply to Chamberlain’s statement that we have very
                            large sums arising from German property analogous [to] the property
                            which under the Versailles Treaty has been used in Allied countries to
                            meet private claims arising out of the war it might be suggested that
                            Germany indemnified her nationals but has not done so in our case.
                            Furthermore, Chamberlain’s statement that any credit balance in favor of
                            Germany resulting from dealing with German property is reckoned as a
                            credit to Germany in the reparations account is not accurate. The Treaty
                            of Versailles, article 297, allows each Government perfect freedom in
                            dealing with alien property and ships. Each Government may take the
                            property and may apply the value of the same on German obligations or it
                            may not. In other words each power is left free to dispose of such
                            property in accordance with its laws and regulations. Only in the event
                            that the Allied Government retains the property is the value thereof
                            dealt with under article 243. I think it should be suggested to the
                            British Government again that we are not presenting the same class of
                            claims as the Allied Governments. Logan says that well over 50 percent
                            of the British claims are based on pensions, allowances, etc., and that
                            if our claims were increased accordingly they would run into billions
                            instead of millions. If we should agree to any set-off as suggested by
                            Chamberlain we would be doing more than the Allies have done as we have
                            presented no such claims or participated in the division of the overseas
                            possessions. I have no knowledge of the pool to which Chamberlain refers
                            but I assume he would be willing to furnish us exact data as to this.
                            Our position, however, as to ships and alien property ought perhaps to
                            be restated.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] The foregoing are partial suggestions for Department’s
                            consideration in answering British note, which I think should be done
                            both in writing and orally. If Department wishes me to prepare an answer
                            along lines indicated, I suggest that Logan and I confer in order to
                            ensure harmonious action. Chamberlain said to me yesterday before I had
                            any knowledge of contents of his note that he thought matter could be
                            worked out with Churchill <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0196"/>(Chancellor of the Exchequer) and I believe note is sent for trading
                            purposes. Chamberlain suggested it might be advisable in future
                            discussions to bring in Chancellor of the Exchequer, so I infer that
                            door is not definitely closed to further discussion. [End
                            paraphrase.]</p>

                                    the United States in the payments to be made by Germany under
                                    the Dawes plan and I am instructed by my Government to make the
                                    following reply:</p>
                                <p>(1)—My Government is gratified to receive confirmation of the
                                    assurance verbally given by Sir E. Crowe that so far as His
                                    Majesty’s Government are concerned there is no question
                                    regarding the costs of the American Army of Occupation, as the
                                    principle at stake is deemed to have been finally settled by the
                                    agreement of May 25, 1923, between the United States and the
                                    Principal Allied Powers, but my Government must express its
                                    surprise at the attitude taken by His Majesty’s Government in
                                    relation to the other American claims which were the subject of
                                    my memorandum of November 15th.<note n="4" xml:id="d73fn4"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_85">p.
                                            85</ref>.</note> My Government has seen fit voluntarily
                                    to limit its claims against Germany to categories of damages for
                                    injuries to persons and property and debts, and it has not been
                                    thought that His Majesty’s Government would be disposed to
                                    question the right of the United States to participate <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the Allied Powers in the
                                    payments to be made by Germany.</p>
                                <p>(2) My Government regrets that His Majesty’s Government find
                                    difficulty with the legal position taken in the memorandum which
                                    I presented and my Government is unable to concur in the views
                                    which Your Excellency has expressed upon this point.</p>
                                <p>The suggestion that the other Powers (under Article 248 of the
                                    Treaty of Versailles or otherwise) could assert a charge upon
                                    all the assets of Germany to the exclusion of the United States
                                    from recovery upon its just claims would be, in the judgment of
                                    my Government, not only repugnant to equity but also
                                    inadmissible from a legal standpoint. The United States
                                    effectively participated in the war and contributed to the
                                    common victory. As one of the Allied and <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0197"/>Associated Powers, it was
                                    equally entitled with its co-belligerents to enforce its just
                                    claims against Germany. The Armistice agreement provided for
                                    reparation for damage done, with the reservation that any
                                    subsequent concessions and claims by the Allies and the United
                                    States remained unaffected. The contention of His Majesty’s
                                    Government would appear to come to this,—that one or more of the
                                    Allied and Associated Powers could properly make a separate
                                    agreement with Germany by which that Power or Powers would be
                                    entitled, not simply to recover upon its own claims, but to
                                    provide for the deprivation of co-belligerent States of
                                    satisfaction or remedy. The Treaty of Versailles provided that
                                    it should come into force between the ratifying parties when
                                    ratified by Germany and by three of the Principal Allied and
                                    Associated Powers. But my Government is unable to conceive that,
                                    if that Treaty had contained provisions which made it
                                    unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government and had come into force
                                    without ratification by the British Empire, His Majesty’s
                                    Government would have taken the view that France, Italy and
                                    Belgium, for example, would have had the right to demand the
                                    appropriation of all the available property of Germany and leave
                                    Great Britain without recourse for her claims. If such action
                                    were admissible, it could conceivably have been taken, as
                                    suggested above, by any one Power which had been able to enter
                                    into a separate engagement with Germany of like purport.</p>
                                <p>The general principle that a later treaty may not be permitted to
                                    alter or vary the obligations assumed by one of the Contracting
                                    Parties in favor of other Powers does not, as it seems to my
                                    Government, warrant the conclusion that other Powers by an
                                    earlier treaty may lawfully deprive third States of their
                                    rights. The position of the Powers ratifying the Treaty of
                                    Versailles is stated in Article 231 of that Treaty as follows:
                                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany
                                            accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for
                                            causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and
                                            Associated Governments and their nationals have been
                                            subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them
                                            by the aggression of Germany and her allies.’</p>
                                    </quote></p>
                                <p>Thus the Powers ratifying that Treaty explicitly affirmed the
                                    responsibility of Germany to each of the Allied and Associated
                                    Governments for the loss and damage each had sustained. The
                                    claims which are urged by the United States against Germany for
                                    injuries to persons and property arose out of these injuries,
                                    and not out of the Treaty of Versailles, and the United States
                                    lost none of its rights by not ratifying that Treaty. By its
                                    Treaty with Germany the United States has not sought to enforce
                                    any claims at the expense of its co-belligerents; Germany was
                                    under responsibility to the United States no less than to its
                                    co-belligerents and Germany accordingly has recognized the just
                                    claims of the United States; and it is the view of my Government
                                    that the Allied Powers have not been, and are not, in a position
                                    to deny these claims or to deprive them of effect by insisting
                                    upon absorbing all the assets of Germany for their own
                                    purposes.</p>
                                <p>I have noted Your Excellency’s reference to the Separation
                                    Commission, but I do not suppose that it would be contended that
                                    the competency of the Powers in their relation to the just
                                    claims of their <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0198"/>co-belligerents could be enlarged by any attempt to create an
                                    exclusive collecting agency.</p>
                                <p>(3) It may be added that the Treaty of Versailles does not appear
                                    by its terms to have intended such a result as the deprivation
                                    of the United States of recourse for its claims, for that Treaty
                                    apparently contemplated provision for the payment of all the
                                    claims for which the responsibility of Germany was affirmed.
                                    There is found no obligation, expressed or implied, in the
                                    Versailles Treaty that can be regarded as intended to
                                    incapacitate Germany to provide for the payment to the United
                                    States of the separate claims of the United States and its
                                    nationals. Subsequently, it became necessary to devise some plan
                                    which would enable the currency of Germany to be stabilized and
                                    her budget to be balanced by arranging a practicable scheme of
                                    payments and with this purpose the Dawes plan was formulated. In
                                    Section XI, Part I of the Dawes report it is said that the
                                    Committee desires to make it ‘quite clear’ that the sums to be
                                    paid ‘comprise all amounts for which Germany may be liable to
                                    the Allied and Associated Powers for the costs arising out of
                                    the war, including reparation, restitution, all costs of all
                                    armies of occupation’ et cetera. It was added that wherever in
                                    any part of the report reference was made to Treaty payments it
                                    was intended ‘to include all charges payable by Germany to the
                                    Allied and Associated Powers for these war costs’. It is thus
                                    evident that whatever may have been the purpose of the Treaty of
                                    Versailles, and my Government does not believe that it was the
                                    intent or could have been the effect of that Treaty to exclude
                                    the United States from recovery of its just claims, it is the
                                    intent of the Dawes plan to provide comprehensively for all the
                                    payments that Germany can make.</p>
                                <p>(4) With reference to Your Excellency’s observations concerning
                                    the insertion in the Dawes report of the words ‘Associated
                                    Powers, I may point out that there is no question of an
                                    instruction to the American members of the Dawes Committee as
                                    they were not representatives of the Government of the United
                                    States. When, however, it came to the notice of my Government
                                    that there was likelihood of consideration being given to
                                    inclusive payments by Germany that might utilize her full
                                    capacity of payment, my Government did take occasion to cause
                                    attention to be drawn to the claims of the United States in
                                    order that there should be no question of their exclusion. My
                                    Government does not assume to raise a question as to the
                                    personal understanding of the British member of the Dawes
                                    Committee, but I must beg leave to point out the clear import of
                                    the language used.</p>
                                <p>But if there could have been earlier misapprehension it certainly
                                    was dispelled at the London Conference which took action to make
                                    the Dawes report effective. As I have already stated in my
                                    memorandum, to which Your Excellency’s note refers, that
                                    Conference was fully aware of the comprehensive scope of the
                                    Dawes report and the nature of the American claims. I notified
                                    the representatives of Great Britain and the other Powers
                                    participating in that Conference individually and also the
                                    plenary Conference as a whole of the position of the United
                                    States. Permit me to repeat that on August 5, 1924, I sent a
                                    letter to the Secretary General of the Conference directing
                                    attention to the scope of the Dawes report and stating the
                                    interest of the United States in the distribution of the
                                    payments <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0199"/>under the
                                    Dawes plan. Accordingly I insisted oil behalf of my Government
                                    that it should have the right to participate in the proposed
                                    Conference of Finance Ministers which was to meet for the
                                    purpose of discussing the allocation of the payments to be made
                                    by Germany. (<hi rend="italic">Proceeding of the London

                                <p>On August 12, 1924, I further explained in the plenary session of

                                    Conference acted on the Dawes plan with full knowledge of the

                                    report.</p>
                                <p>My Government does not consider it open to question that the
                                    Dawes report contemplated that the funds in the hands of the
                                    Agent General should be charged with all the claims against
                                    Germany, including the claims of the United States. This report
                                    was accepted by Germany and by all the Allied Governments by the
                                    final Protocol of the London Conference. It seems hardly
                                    necessary to discuss the functions of the Dawes Committee as
                                    their report was thus acted upon by the Powers directly and,
                                    having been adopted by a protocol signed by the Allied Powers,
                                    must be deemed to be as binding as the Treaty of Versailles
                                    itself. If any question had been open under the Treaty of
                                    Versailles with respect to the participation of the United
                                    States in payments made by Germany, and it is the opinion of my
                                    Government that there was not, it was competent for the Powers
                                    to provide for that participation; and this provision was
                                    made.</p>
                                <p>(5) In view of the facts that I have stated, my Government is
                                    unable to understand the expression of surprise in Your
                                    Excellency’s note at the claim of the, United States to share in
                                    the payments under the Dawes plan. Nor does my Government find
                                    itself to be debarred, by any action it has taken, from the
                                    right of such participation <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>
                                    with the other interested Powers.</p>
                                <p>I observe Your Excellency’s reference to the Conference at Spa in
                                    1920. My Government did not participate in that Conference and
                                    it may again be remarked that it was not competent for the
                                    Allied Powers to affect the just claims of the United States
                                    without its consent. This, it is believed, was clearly
                                    understood. On August 5, 1920, Mr. Boy den caused to be inserted
                                    in the minutes of the Reparation Commission a statement
                                    referring to the Spa arrangements that ‘these decisions to which
                                    the United States is not a party, do not affect the position of
                                    the United States’. At the meeting on September 10, 1920, the
                                    Reparation Commission in referring to the Spa agreement adopted
                                    a resolution which was intended to express the view that that
                                    agreement was not regarded as being in force with respect to
                                    those Powers which were not signatories.</p>
                                <p>(6) The Treaty between the United States and Germany came into
                                    force in November, 1921. Germany accepted responsibility for the
                                    same categories of claims of the United States as those which
                                    were recognized in the case of the Powers ratifying the Treaty
                                    of Versailles. In August, 1922, an agreement was made between
                                    the United States and Germany for the establishment of an
                                    arbitral commission which should pass upon the claims of the
                                    United States. <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0200"/>In
                                    negotiating that agreement my Government notified Germany that
                                    it would not present claims of the sort described in
                                    subdivisions 5, 6, and 7 of Annex I of Part VIII of the Treaty
                                    of Versailles, including pensions, assistance to prisoners of
                                    war, their families and dependents, and allowances to families
                                    and dependents of mobilized persons, et cetera. My Government is
                                    informed that the claims of these last mentioned categories
                                    submitted by the Allied Powers amounted to very large sums. Had
                                    my Government pressed claims of these categories its total
                                    claims would have been vastly increased.</p>
                                <p>While my Government did not urge these claims for general
                                    reparations which were described in the Treaty of Versailles as
                                    ‘damage caused to the peoples of the Allied and Associated
                                    Powers’, my Government did arrange in the agreement with
                                    Germany, to which I have referred, for the determination of its
                                    just claims for actual injuries to persons and property and
                                    debts. And these claims my Government has had no intention of
                                    relinquishing. In the speech of the Secretary of State of the
                                    United States at New Haven in December, 1922, to which Your
                                    Excellency alludes, the Secretary of State did not intend to
                                    forego, and did not forego, the right of the United States to
                                    enforce such claims against Germany. The reference in that
                                    speech, as its language shows, was to ‘general reparations’, the
                                    claims for which as already stated my Government was not
                                    pressing, and not to the classes of claims which were then in
                                    process of adjudication under the agreement which the Secretary
                                    of State had already negotiated. The United States was not
                                    proceeding to the adjudication of its claims under this
                                    agreement as a mere matter of form, and when the Dawes plan was
                                    developed to provide for all the payments within the capacity of
                                    Germany, my Government appropriately directed attention to its
                                    claims and asserted its right of participation.</p>
                                <p>(7) I have dwelt upon the legal questions raised by Your
                                    Excellency’s note, but in doing so I have no desire to lessen
                                    the emphasis upon the clear equity involved, as my Government
                                    does not understand that this equity is disputed. By reason of
                                    its relation to the war the United States, certainly as a matter
                                    of justice, is entitled to receive payment of its claims <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the other Powers
                                    associated in the common victory. By its voluntary action in not
                                    pressing large categories of claims for general reparations, my
                                    Government has greatly limited, to the benefit of the Allied
                                    Powers, the extent of its participation in Germany’s payments.
                                    My Government is unable to conceive that there would be any
                                    disposition on the part of His Majesty’s Government to contest
                                    the equity of its participation in such payments to cover the
                                    limited classes of claims for which the United States seeks
                                    recovery.</p>
                                <p>(8) The amount of my Government’s claim for the costs of the
                                    American army of occupation has already been stated with very
                                    close approximation. As the claims against Germany for injuries
                                    to persons and property and debts are in course of adjudication,
                                    it is impossible at this time to give a final statement of their
                                    amount, but it is estimated that they will be in the
                                    neighborhood of $350,000,000.</p>
                                <p>With respect to Your Excellency’s suggestion as to the reduction
                                    of claims ‘by reduction past or prospective of German payments’
                                    I may say that my Government has already reduced its claims by
                                        <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0201"/>eliminating
                                    pensions, allowances, et cetera, as I have already stated, and
                                    there is not perceived to be any occasion for a reduction in
                                    respect to the limited classes of claims for which the United
                                    States seeks participation.</p>
                                <p>I have noted Your Excellency’s inquiry as to German assets which
                                    have come into the hands of my Government and in this relation I
                                    must call attention to the provisions of Article 297 of the
                                    Treaty of Versailles which give to each Government perfect
                                    freedom in dealing with such property. Each Government may take
                                    the property and apply the same on Germany’s obligations or it
                                    may not; in other words each Power is left free to dispose of
                                    such property in accordance with its laws and regulations. It is
                                    understood that some, if not all, of the Allied Powers have
                                    released at least a part of such property. Only in the event of
                                    the retention of such property or its proceeds by the Allied or
                                    Associated Powers is the amount of the proceeds or the value of
                                    such property to be credited against its claims. My Government
                                    is entitled to the same freedom of choice in its disposition of
                                    German property as that enjoyed by the Allied Powers. The
                                    disposition of the property in question is subject to the
                                    control of the Congress of the United States but my Government
                                    of course intends with respect to such property or proceeds as
                                    may be finally retained to give appropriate credit upon its
                                    claims.</p>
                                <p>(9) My Government has not failed to observe with gratification
                                    the expression of the desire of His Majesty’s Government to give
                                    full and friendly consideration to its position in this matter
                                    and has instructed me to assure Your Excellency that while it
                                    must insist upon its legal and equitable right to participate in
                                    the payments by Germany under the Dawes plan, it has no wish to
                                    be oppressive. As it has already indicated, the Government of
                                    the United States is ready to make a fair arrangement as to the
                                    annual extent of its participation. And my Government will be
                                    glad to enter into a discussion of the details of such an
                                    arrangement.</p>
                                <p>Accept, Excellency, et cetera.”</p>

                        <p>209. Department informed by Logan, who will represent the United States
                            at Paris Financial Conference meeting January 6, that Japanese Delegate
                            to preliminary Expert Committee in Paris has confidentially advised him
                            under instructions from Tokyo that <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0202"/>following cursory examination of the subject Japanese
                            Government sees no reason why American position regarding participation
                            in Dawes Plan annuities should not be supported. The delegate requested
                            that this support be considered tentative and confidential for the time
                            being, since the question is still being studied by his Government from
                            the legal viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>The following summary of the Department’s views and of the general
                            situation is furnished you for discreet use in case a favorable
                            opportunity offers for the discussion of the question with the Japanese
                            Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>United States believes that it is legally and equitably entitled to
                            participation in the Dawes Plan annuities for the satisfaction not only
                            of its army cost claim but also of the awards of the Mixed Claims
                            Commission on account of American claims against Germany. The Belgian,
                            French, and Italian Governments have indicated that they will support
                            the American position on equitable grounds, and it now is hoped that the
                            Japanese Government may also give its support.</p>

                        <p>585. [Paraphrase.] L–285, from Logan. As the Finance Ministers’
                            conference approaches I need the Department’s definite instructions on
                            certain questions. I realize that the trend of the negotiations may
                            result in the shifting of our position on some points and that many
                            details may have to be adjusted by exchange of cables as the conference
                            progresses, but I do not want to be placed in position of delaying
                            conference unduly and of not being able to announce our position on
                            questions of fundamental principles at time when it is opportune to
                            declare it. I believe that I am aware of Department’s general position,
                            as it has been stated from time to time, but nevertheless in order to be
                            sure that new developments have not altered that position I put the
                            following questions:</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0203"/>
                        <p>1. Is the Department ready to waive all payments for Army costs or other
                            claims during first two years, providing that a satisfactory arrangement
                            is made for future years?</p>
                        <p>[Suggested] answer: Yes, if necessary, but it is desirable to obtain
                            percentage on account of Army costs on any cash which might be
                            transferred during second year. Percentage might be fixed at 20 percent
                            of cash transferred with understanding that the United States would
                            demand at most not more than 30 million gold marks.</p>
                        <p>2. What percentages for Army costs or for other claims, or both, would
                            Department seek in any capital sums that may be realized in addition to
                            annuities because of sale of industrial or railway bonds? Would
                            percentages be on sliding scale in accordance with proportion between
                            amount of bonds sold in the United States and those sold elsewhere?</p>
                        <p>Suggested answer: Out of a capital payment on account of Army costs and
                            other claims, the United States will ask for each claim a sum which is
                            proportionate to amount to which it would be entitled if these capital
                            receipts were annuities instead of being capital receipts; and in
                            addition, to satisfy claims besides Army costs, United States will
                            desire 10 percent extra if one-half bond issue were floated in the
                            United States with sliding scale of 1 percent additional for each 5
                            percent over one-half floated in the United States. Concretely, if the
                            loan were $100,000,000 and the percentage of the United States on its
                            reparation claims were 5 percent and $70,000,000 of the loan were placed
                            in the United States we should ask: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) 50–60
                            million gold marks for Army costs; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) $4,000,000
                            (5 percent on an assumed balance, after priorities, of $80,000,000); and
                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) $14,000,000 as a recognition of our
                            special contribution to loan. Will the Department be good enough to
                            indicate its views on this general suggestion? In forthcoming
                            arrangements we must be ready to formulate our claims against capital
                            receipts, as it is very probable some of the bonds will be floated in
                            next two or three years.</p>
                        <p>3. Is the Department agreeable to the suggestion that we should ask for
                            annual lump sum of 50 or 60 million gold marks for our Army costs to be
                            paid by priority from cash transferred? Will figure be 50 or 60?</p>
                        <p>4. As part of the foregoing proposal there is coupled with it question
                            whether Department is willing as far as its other claims are concerned
                            to accept fixed percentage which will be operative on net balance
                            remaining after all priorities have been deducted from annuities, and
                            from which United States will be paid <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>
                            with Allies. [End paraphrase.]</p>
                        <p>Concretely it appears that we shall require around 4 to 5 percent of sums
                            remaining after priorities are deducted in order to secure <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0204"/>a sum which added to a flat annuity of
                            50 million for Army costs would bring a grand total of 125,000,000 gold
                            marks per annum in standard year. In answering this question I request
                            Department particularly to consider the effect of expression <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>. It means that we would merely have a
                            credit in reichsmarks in the hands of Agent General and that it would
                            then be up to us as it is to the other Allies to find ways and means of
                            getting these funds out of Germany. Is Department willing to accept such
                            a reichsmarks credit? Although it is perhaps unnecessary to decide
                            finally now how we would use such a credit nevertheless likely that
                            Allies will make general inquiries because of repercussion of our system
                            on their own modes of utilizing their funds which are now being worked
                            out. Two suggestions are the following:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Congress might authorize proceeds of enemy
                            property in the United States to be paid in dollars to recipients of
                            Mixed Claims awards, German Government in turn issuing bonds in marks.
                            These bonds to be given German owners of the German property so
                            liquidated. The United States then assigning to the Germans for the
                            service of these bonds the reichsmarks accruing to its account with the
                            Agent General.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] On this solution Hill is hesitant. Owen Young and Gilbert
                            have favored this arrangement and my own view inclines overwhelmingly to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The reichsmarks might be allowed to remain on
                            deposit in Berlin, and by some arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank
                            the Government could perhaps sell them to American merchants or bankers
                            who have obligations to meet in Germany or elsewhere in reichsmarks. The
                            merchants and bankers have to buy reichsmarks from someone and they
                            might as well buy indirectly from the United States. This is a matter of
                            banking machinery, but would in large measure assimilate our position to
                            that of deliveries in kind.</p>
                        <p>The Department probably has additional solutions to offer, and I should
                            like to have an expression of its views.</p>
                        <p>5. The British and the French in their adjustment of the Belgian debt
                            question under article 232 of the Treaty of Versailles and Germany’s
                            liability for this debt are proceeding on theory that the right of the
                            United States can be disregarded, probably on ground that we have not
                            waived our claim against Belgium and accepted Germany’s liability for
                            it. There are two possible positions: The first is for us to insist on
                            receiving a percentage of the annuity for satisfaction of the Belgian
                            debt just as the British and the French proposed to do (with Belgium’s
                            agreement) and that that percentage be proportionate to amount of our
                            debt and the amount of British and French debts, and that that
                            proportion be separate from and in addition to other claims against the
                            annuities. I am aware that this <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0205"/>may have the objection of linking our debt claims with the reparation
                            problem, but it seems to me that appropriate reservations could at least
                            safeguard our position. The other solution is for us to insist that
                            Belgium receive the amount which we would receive if we were to claim
                            it. Reason for this would be that Belgium owes us money, and that if
                            Belgium instead of Germany is going to pay us, as was the real intent of
                            the treaty, then Belgium ought to receive compensation from the German
                            annuities. I should like to be informed which of these alternatives the
                            Department wishes me to take, or if neither, what other suggestion the
                            Department has to offer. This question of the Belgian debt will be among
                            the questions early discussed and it is indispensable that I receive
                            instructions without delay.</p>
                        <p>6. Am I to understand clearly that the United States is willing to
                            abrogate the agreement of May 25, 1923, entirely and to incorporate new
                            mode of payment of Army costs in any new instrument which may be drawn
                            up by the Finance Ministers’ conference, or is it our Government’s
                            position that the agreement of May 25 is merely to be held in abeyance?
                            It is my opinion that the Allies will insist on agreement’s definitive
                            abrogation and on the acceptance of a new scheme.</p>
                        <p>7. Is my understanding correct that if we accept a flat annuity and
                            percentage it will not be necessary to state formally in any instrument
                            that will be drawn up that we assert claim to interest on either Army
                            costs or other claims? In my view it is preferable not to speak of
                            interest, and if interest must be covered to try to cover it by
                            increasing our percentage demands.</p>
                        <p>8. If the United States does ultimately give credit to Germany for ships
                            or other property, how, in practice, would the credit be given; i. e.,
                            against current annuities or on capital claims, with result that the
                            number of annuities would be reduced? I suggest that latter position be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The Department will aid me greatly by giving specific answers promptly to
                            these eight questions. Logan. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>342. Referring to your telegram 209, December 14, 4 p.m. In a
                            conversation with Foreign Minister last evening he said their
                            representatives at Paris had been instructed to approve in principle the
                            American claim if all the other powers agree; that since my former
                            conversation he had heard from London that British were willing to
                            consent to our claim for occupation expenses and were willing to discuss
                            our claim for damages on three conditions: (1) amount of our claim
                            should be stated, (2) our claim should be reduced in the proportion in
                            which the signatories of Versailles Treaty reduced their claims, (3) the
                            value of German property in our custody should be credited on our claim.
                            I answered that the question related only to our claims for damages and
                            that your position as originally stated was that the alien property fund
                            was to be deducted from that claim. That the British proposal was hardly
                            reasonable, that we should give to the other powers the benefit of our
                            alien property fund as a condition to our sharing in the reparations and
                            our Government certainly would not consider it. If, however, our claim
                            for the balance left after crediting the alien property fund were
                            allowed by all the other powers our Government would be willing to stand
                            any fair reduction proportionately to reductions made by the other
                            powers on their similar claims. I said further that I understood Japan
                            agreed with all the other powers except Great Britain, that on equitable
                                <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0207"/>grounds there was no reason
                            to question our claim. The Minister answered: “Yes, I am only desirous
                            of considering the legal basis of your claim and when I receive the
                            lawyers opinion I will let you know.”</p>

                        <p>480. L–175, for Logan. Your L–285, December 19, 7 p.m. Your questions are
                            answered <hi rend="italic">seriatim</hi> as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) Yes, if necessary; but it is desirable, as you suggest, to obtain
                            participation in cash payments. The provisions of the Dawes Plan in
                            regard to expending most of annuities the first two years in Germany are
                            not strictly in accord, it is true, with the procedure looked to at time
                            of agreement of May 25, 1923, and of course you appreciate desirability
                            of not making further concessions in matter than are absolutely
                            necessary, especially as terms of the agreement are on a basis most
                            generous to the Allies. In regard to suggested figure of 20 percent, the
                            Department points out that paragraphs V and VIII of article 2 of
                            agreement of May 25 provide for limitation in certain circumstances to
                            25 percent and 50 percent, respectively, Should a proposal be made by
                            Allied representatives to introduce a figure of 20 percent or a
                            limitation of 30 million gold marks, the Department would, however,
                            consider matter if you believed a concession on this point to be
                            desirable.</p>
                        <p>If the Allied Governments receive external payments during the first two
                            years, there does not seem to be any good reason why the United States
                            should not also receive external payments in respect to Army costs and
                            other claims. You will bear in mind, in this connection, that it may
                            also be possible, as indicated in (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) under your
                            question 4, to arrange to utilize enemy property, compensating the
                            owners in German currency; see Department’s telegram L–80, June 14,
                                1924,<note n="8" xml:id="d78fn8"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_18">p. 18</ref>.</note> paragraph (9). You may be
                            able to find formula broad enough to cover this point.</p>
                        <p>You will also bear in mind, of course, that the funds already turned over
                            by Belgium should be retained. As these and any other similar payments
                            correspond to period 1923–1924 before Dawes Plan became operative, they
                            should not be thought of as first payment in respect to installments
                            covering period since September 1, 1924.</p>
                        <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0208"/>
                        <p>2. The Department agrees that in principle the percentage of capital
                            payments should be same as if these receipts were annuities; it also
                            agrees that arrangements along lines you suggest, for increased
                            participation in event of flotation of a certain proportion of issues in
                            the United States, would be highly advantageous. The percentages might
                            be applied to gross proceeds realized from these loans rather than to
                            amounts offered, as these might not be fully subscribed.</p>
                        <p>3. The Department believes it to be highly advantageous to ask for 60
                            million gold marks, but you may accept 50 million, if absolutely
                            necessary, which would liquidate the Army costs claim in 20 years. In
                            regard to priorities, the Army costs should rank after the service of
                            the 1924 German loan and may rank after the costs of the Reparation
                            Commission and other agencies of control. Up to 1927 they may rank after
                            the cash applied to Allied current Army costs as looked to in the
                            agreement of May 25, 1923, if you can not now make a more favorable
                            arrangement. Please refer, in this connection, to your L–278 and
                                279,<note n="9" xml:id="d78fn9">Neither printed.</note> which
                            indicate that French and Belgians have proposed extensive schemes of
                            priorities. These priorities (except for exceptions just stated) should
                            not outrank American Army costs, and when framing of drafts takes place,
                            it would be advantageous to have priority provision for our Army costs
                            included. As for our other claims, the Department also sees no reason
                            why such items as restitution and clearing payments or the Belgian war
                            debt should rank ahead of rather than <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi>
                            with these other American claims.</p>
                        <p>4. The answer is “yes”, but as stated above it will be necessary
                            carefully to examine the priorities desired by other Governments. The
                            priorities will, of course, have significance only in event that full
                            payments looked to should not be deposited by Germany or not be
                            transferred. Principle governing priorities has been stated above and in
                            previous instructions. Should it turn out that certain sums deposited in
                            Germany should not be deemed transferable, the Department would not, of
                            course, seek any privileged position with respect to transfer, except
                            that for Army costs, which have a recognized priority under agreement of
                            May 25, priority of transfer should be accorded if necessary. The
                            suggested figure of 125,000,000 gold marks would be quite satisfactory,
                            as this would, presumably, pay off both the Army costs and other claims
                            within about 20 years.</p>
                        <p>You will be instructed later on your alternative suggestions (a) and
                            (b).</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>5. The Department will send separate cable in regard to the Belgian
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>6. The Department is prepared to abrogate the agreement of May 25, 1923,
                            provided a satisfactory new agreement is concluded, and you may so
                            state. Obviously the Department’s position would be strengthened were
                            France to ratify the agreement.</p>
                        <p>7. The Department believes it preferable not to refer to interest.</p>
                        <p>8. Credit for enemy property including ships, if finally retained, should
                            be given on the capital claim for damages, that is to say, not for Army
                            costs.</p>
                        <p>Give Ambassador Kellogg a copy of your L–285 and of this telegram.</p>

                        <p>482. Should the British continue to maintain their present unexpectedly
                            hostile attitude toward our participation in the Dawes Plan annuities in
                            respect to American claims except Army costs and should matter
                            accordingly have to be threshed out at Paris Conference, it may be
                            desirable for you to go to Paris at commencement of conference and be
                            there during a part, at least, of its sessions, both because of your
                            services at the London Conference and your special familiarity with the
                            legal questions involved, and because of your having already discussed
                            matter with the British. As you are aware, the President and I attach
                            greatest importance to these negotiations and to having American rights
                            suitably recognized. I am sure that Ambassador Herrick and Mr. Logan
                            would under these circumstances fully appreciate situation and would
                            understand that your going to Paris did not in any way reflect upon

                        <p>483. Telegram received today from Ambassador Bancroft indicating that he,
                            not having understood our position in regard to <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0210"/>alien property, has inadvertently made
                            incorrect statements to Japanese Foreign Office in carrying out
                            Department’s instructions to him of December 14 to enlist Japanese
                            support for our position on claims. It appears that impression may have
                            been given Japanese Government that Government of the United States is
                            prepared to apply alien property fund against our claims, and some
                            statement has also been made regarding reduction in American claims.</p>
                        <p>I am cabling our position fully to the Ambassador and am instructing him
                            to correct at once any misapprehension that may have been created. He
                            has also been instructed to ascertain whether Foreign Office has
                            telegraphed his statements to Japanese Missions in Europe and, if it
                            has, to endeavor to correct any misunderstanding at once. I have pointed
                            out serious embarrassment which might arise in London or Paris were our
                            position on these points to be misunderstood.</p>
                        <p>I do not see that you need take any action unless it appears that our
                            position has been incorrectly communicated to Japanese Missions in
                            Europe or to other Governments, or unless you think it advisable, should
                            you have suitable opportunity, to make plain in informal way our
                            position to your Japanese colleague, but not referring to situation just
                            described. Repeat to Logan as Department’s L–176.</p>

                            advised by his Government of the full text of the “Memorandum dealing
                            with the question of American participation in the payments to be made
                            by Germany under the Dawes Plan”, dated November 15, which Kellogg
                            handed Chamberlain,<note n="10" xml:id="d82fn10"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_85">p. 85</ref>.</note> and
                            particularly he had not been formally advised of any willingness on our
                            part to reduce the Wadsworth Agreement annuities provided our other
                            claims position was recognized. Therefore on December 22 I wrote him a
                            letter wherein I simply referred to our conversation [omission?] “For
                            your convenience therefore I quote the following excerpt from the
                            memorandum handed Mr. Chamberlain by Mr. Kellogg on November 15 [<hi rend="italic">19</hi>] last.”</p>
                        <p>My quotation from the November 15 memorandum was an extract of about half
                            the last paragraph of that memorandum starting with the words “It is the
                            desire of the United States to facilitate in every way the settlement of
                            the reparation question, etc.” and finishing with the words “The Army
                            costs are of course a prior charge.” I concluded my letter with the
                            statement that “I trust that in accordance with your statement that the
                            foregoing will be of assistance in reaching an early solution of the
                            question at issue.”</p>
                        <p>2. Under date of December 23 I received the following letter from
                            Leith-Ross: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have to thank you for your letter of the 22nd instant calling
                                    attention to the passage in the memorandum left with Mr.
                                    Chamberlain by the United States Ambassador on the 15th November
                                    last in which it is stated that ‘The United States are willing
                                    to recast the Army Costs Agreement and to make an extension of
                                    time of payment provided a reasonable percentage of the money
                                    paid into the bank for reparations is also allowed on its
                                    general claims’.</p>

                                    is to claim that: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the United States
                                    Army costs arrears should be met by an annuity spread over 24
                                    years from the 1st January 1923, which would be a prior claim
                                    charge on future cash receipts and which would amount <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0212"/>to from 45 to 50
                                    million gold marks per annum; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the
                                    other claim would be met by an annuity not exceeding 40 to 50
                                    million gold marks per annum expressed at a percentage of the
                                    Dawes annuity, i. e. as the annual payments in the normal year
                                    are fixed at 2½ milliards the percentage required would not
                                    exceed 2 percent. These payments would not be entitled to any
                                    priority and would be transferred <hi rend="italic">pari
                                        passu</hi> with the reparation shares of the Allied

                                <p>“The most careful consideration has been given by His Majesty’s
                                    Government to the additional arguments contained in the note
                                    which Your Excellency was so good as to address to me on the
                                    10th December, relative to the claim of the United States
                                    Government to participate in respect of claims for damages to
                                    persons and property in the payments to be made by Germany under
                                    the Dawes Plan.</p>
                                <p>2. The United States Government believe their claim to be well
                                    founded in law. His Majesty’s Government to their regret are
                                    unable to find in Your Excellency’s note under reference any
                                    arguments in support of this contention more convincing to them
                                    than those previously advanced, and are unable, with the best
                                    will in the world, to modify their previous opinion.</p>
                                <p>3. As His Majesty’s Government understand it, the United States
                                    Government base their claim on the treaty of August 25th, 1921,
                                    between the United States and Germany, the wording of section XI
                                    of the Dawes report and the acceptance of that report by the
                                    London Conference.</p>
                                <p>4. With regard to the treaty of August 25th, 1921, the view of
                                    His Majesty’s Government is expressed in my note of 3rd
                                    December. The arguments advanced by Your Excellency seem
                                    designed not so much to contest the legal soundness of the view
                                    taken by His Majesty’s Government as to demonstrate the inequity
                                    of a strict application of that view, having regard to the
                                    wording of the Armistice Agreement of November 11th 1918, and of
                                    article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles. I venture to think that
                                    this part of Your Excellency’s note is based on a
                                    misapprehension which I feel it is my duty to correct. The
                                    British contention is not ‘that one or more of the Allied and
                                    Associated Powers could properly make a separate agreement by
                                    which that power or powers would be entitled not simply to
                                    recover upon its own claims but to provide for the deprivation
                                    of cobelligerent states of satisfaction or remedy,’ nor that it
                                    is open to powers who negotiated an earlier treaty lawfully to
                                    deprive third parties of their rights. When more powers than one
                                    have claims against the same state it would no doubt be
                                    contrary, if not to established rules of international law, at
                                    any rate to the commonly accepted understanding of international
                                    intercourse, for a creditor power to conclude without the assent
                                    of other powers similarly situated, or without giving those
                                    powers an opportunity of equal advantage, a treaty with a debtor
                                    state which would have the effect of depriving the debtor of the
                                    capacity of making similar provision for the claims of the other
                                    creditors; though on the other hand, it must not be <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0214"/>forgotten that it has been
                                    recognized that powers which take active steps in accordance
                                    with international law for recovery of a debt may obtain a
                                    preference over other creditors—‘vigilantibus non dormientibus
                                    subvenit aequitas’. But the Treaty of Versailles was not a
                                    separate treaty made by one power with the aim or effect of
                                    getting an exclusive advantage. That treaty was negotiated on
                                    behalf of the United States and 26 other Allied and Associated
                                    Powers, all of whom, except China, signed it. The treaty gave to
                                    the powers who accepted it certain rights and imposed certain
                                    burdens on them. And powers which signed but did not ratify the
                                    treaty clearly forewent those rights and escaped those burdens
                                    of their own voluntary choice.</p>
                                <p>5. I readily admit that it would have been inequitable for the
                                    European Allies to have concluded a treaty with Germany
                                    reserving to themselves an exclusive charge on German assets
                                    without giving to their American copartners in victory an
                                    opportunity to be a party to that treaty, and to share in the
                                    payments to be made by Germany thereunder. But that is the very
                                    opposite of the actual position. The European Allies were, as is
                                    well-known, exceedingly desirous that the United States
                                    Government should be a party to the treaty and not only was the
                                    treaty framed in a form which explicitly included the United
                                    States, but it was actually signed by their representative,
                                    though to the regret of the European Allies, the United States
                                    Government did not subsequently proceed to ratification. The
                                    standpoint of His Majesty’s Government is then merely this, that
                                    all the belligerents who opposed Germany having concluded a
                                    treaty with her in common, one of their number cannot, on
                                    refusal to ratify the treaty, legally claim its benefits; that
                                    they cannot in equity claim to share those benefits without
                                    sharing in the obligations imposed by that instrument; and that
                                    Germany having by that treaty made certain hypothecations or
                                    assignments of her assets to meet the claims of the belligerents
                                    with whom she was contracting, had no power except in agreement
                                    with the latter subsequently to give to a state which decided
                                    not to ratify that treaty, any charge in contradiction with her
                                    previous undertaking.</p>
                                <p>6. The view of His Majesty’s Government regarding the effect of
                                    the wording of the Dawes report has already been stated in my
                                    note of December 3rd. Without wishing to enter into any
                                    controversy concerning the interpretation of section XI of the
                                    Dawes report, His Majesty’s Government remain of opinion that
                                    the Dawes committee had no power or competence to pronounce on
                                    or prejudge the question of the allocation of the annuities
                                    prescribed in their report; and that they did not in fact make
                                    any such pronouncement. Further, if the Dawes committee intended
                                    by their report to express an opinion upon this matter which was
                                    totally alien to their terms of reference, the decision of the
                                    Allied Powers at the London Conference to adopt the Dawes Plan
                                    would not, without further and fuller provision, have involved
                                    the indorsement by the Allies of any incidental opinion so
                                    expressed. So emphatic a change in international treaty rights
                                    could not have been made <hi rend="italic">sub silentio</hi> and
                                    without a formal and specific provision to that effect.</p>
                                <p>7. Your Excellency states that your Government did take occasion
                                    to cause attention to be drawn to the claims of the United
                                    States. His <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0215"/>Majesty’s
                                    Government assume that this is a reference to Your Excellency’s
                                    letter of August 5th, 1924, to the London Conference. They have
                                    been unable to trace any earlier communication from your
                                    Government on the subject to the Governments concerned, and
                                    having regard to the testimony given by General Dawes in the
                                    introduction to his report to the complete independence of the
                                    members of the Dawes committee, it would seem clear that no
                                    formal intimation could have been made to them. As regards the
                                    London Conference the allocation of the annuities was in fact a
                                    matter with which the conference not only did not concern itself
                                    but which it expressly reserved for consideration by a later
                                    meeting of Finance Ministers, the British delegation making it
                                    perfectly clear at the time that, by so referring the matter,
                                    they were not committing themselves to acceptance of the United
                                    States claim. I may remind Your Excellency that at the plenary
                                    session of the 12th August to which you refer Mr. Snowden, then
                                    Chancellor of the Exchequer and a delegate of Great Britain,
                                    said on this very matter ‘It must be distinctly understood from
                                    the British point of view that we do not accept the
                                    interpretation that the United States Ambassador has put upon
                                    the report’ and he added that the United States Government had
                                    ‘made a treaty of their own with Germany. Therefore the United
                                    States cannot be regarded as being in the same position as the
                                    Allied Powers in regard to the disposal of the reparation
                                    payments under the Dawes agreement’.<note n="15" xml:id="d84fn15">Great Britain, Cmd. 2270, Miscellaneous No.
                                        17 (1924), p. 78.</note> It would therefore be incorrect to
                                    say that the United States claim was admitted at the London
                                    Conference or that ‘provision was made’ for it.</p>
                                <p>8. If I have dwelt for a moment on that part of Your Excellency’s
                                    note which deals with the past intentions of the United States
                                    Government to make claims against Germany, it is only in order
                                    to avoid future misunderstandings and to show that those
                                    intentions were unknown to or not understood by His Majesty’s
                                    Government. No doubt the Spa Conference of 1920 could not
                                    deprive the United States Government of any existing rights. But
                                    the inference to be drawn from Mr. Boyden’s declaration to the
                                    Reparation Commission on August 5th, 1920, clearly is that the
                                    United States intended to claim the reimbursement costs of
                                    occupation rather than to make a claim for reparation. This
                                    point will be evident if the whole of the declaration made by
                                    Mr. Boyden is read, and a copy is therefore attached to this
                                    note for convenience of reference.<note n="16" xml:id="d84fn16">The text of Mr. Boyden’s statement as transmitted in

                                        Unofficial Delegate makes no protest or reserve, merely
                                        pointing out that the [<hi rend="italic">these</hi>]
                                        decisions to which the United States is not a party do not
                                        [affect] the position of the United States. With respect to
                                        the course [<hi rend="italic">costs</hi>] of the United
                                        States army of occupation he adds that the United States
                                        obviously understands and expects that it will be reimbursed
                                        in cash for the actual cost and that it will be notified at
                                        once if its army is not wanted on these terms. In this
                                        connection he refers to the letter from the American

                                    the concluding words of which are understood to refer to
                                    Germany, Jugoslavia, Roumania and Greece, and not to the United
                                    States. It is to be observed that Mr. Boyden’s statement was
                                    made, and the Reparation Commission resolution passed, after the
                                    United States Senate had refused in March 1920 to ratify the
                                    Treaty of Versailles. The declaration on the 5th August in
                                    effect was that the United States unofficial delegate made no
                                    protest or reservation in view of the arrangement between the
                                    powers concerned as to the priority to be afforded to the
                                    advances which, under the terms of the Spa protocol, they were
                                    to make to Germany in order to facilitate the delivery of coal.
                                    Mr. Boyden pointed out ‘that these decisions’ (that is the
                                    decisions as to the priority of coal advances) ‘to which the
                                    United States is not a party do not affect the position of the
                                    United States,’ and he added a statement as to the understanding
                                    of the United States that it would be reimbursed for the costs
                                    of the United States Army of Occupation—an understanding which
                                    the British Government has never sought in any way to put in
                                    doubt. In any case ‘these decisions’ had nothing to do with any
                                    share in reparation percentages.</p>

                                    Army costs; that note had reference to those costs and nothing
                                    but those costs. Similarly, it would appear from the minutes of
                                    the Reparation Commission of September 10th, 1920, that the
                                    resolution of the commission of that date to which allusion is
                                    made in the American note, had reference to the reservation of
                                    ‘the rights and interests of other powers signatory to the
                                    respective treaties which were not parties’ to the Spa Agreement
                                    of July 16th, 1920. The debate in the commission had reference
                                    solely to the rights of Germany and those of the minor powers
                                    (Greece, Roumania, Jugoslavia) which had not at that time
                                    accepted the Spa Agreement. The resolution of the commission,
                                    when it speaks of ‘other powers signatory to the respective
                                    treaties’ certainly did not refer to the United States. As the
                                    United States Senate had at that date rejected the treaty the
                                    signature of the President of the United States to that <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0217"/>treaty could not be
                                    considered to be any longer effective and the United States
                                    could no longer properly be termed a ‘signatory’ power.</p>
                                <p>9. I have felt it necessary to state once more in some detail the
                                    legal position as it appears to His Majesty’s Government only
                                    because the United States Government have themselves given
                                    prominence to the legal aspect of the matter. His Majesty’s
                                    Government do not however desire to take their stand merely on
                                    legal points, and I therefore turn to the consideration of
                                    equity.</p>
                                <p>10. Your Excellency was good enough in your note of the 10th,
                                    December to give an estimate of the United States claims at
                                    $350,000,000. It is known that these claims included not merely
                                    (1) claims for damages while the United States was actually at
                                    war with Germany, but also (2) claims in respect of pre-war
                                    debts, and (3) claims in respect of damages suffered by United
                                    States citizens before the United States was a belligerent. Your
                                    Excellency does not state in what proportion the total of
                                    $350,000,000 is divisible between these three heads. It appears
                                    however to His Majesty’s Government to be of the first
                                    importance to know this proportion. The United States, they
                                    understand, desire to be treated <hi rend="italic">pari
                                        passu</hi> with the Allies enjoying rights under the Treaty
                                    of Versailles. Under that treaty, however, claims under heads
                                    (2) and (3) are not recoverable as part of the Dawes annuities.
                                    Under the specific provisions of part X of the treaty, claims
                                    for payment of debts unpaid owing to the war and claims growing
                                    out of acts committed by the German Government or any German
                                    authority between July 31st, 1914, and the moment when the
                                    particular power concerned entered the war against Germany, are
                                    chargeable and only chargeable against German property
                                    sequestrated in the country of which the claimant is a national.
                                    His Majesty’s Government assume that the United States
                                    Government do not propose that these claims should not be
                                    treated by the United States Government in like manner as all
                                    similar claims under the treaty, and that they will be met from
                                    German property in the United States hands. Any other method
                                    would result in giving the United States a privileged position
                                    over other claimants on Germany, a position which His Majesty’s
                                    Government are loath to believe that the United States
                                    Government desire to claim. That the United States Government
                                    themselves recognize the bearing of this consideration upon
                                    their contention is shown by the assurance given at the end of
                                    the 8th paragraph of Your Excellency’s note, that they of course
                                    intend, with respect to such (German) property or proceeds as
                                    may be finally retained, to give appropriate credit upon their
                                    claims.</p>
                                <p>11. Reparation claims comprise damage to civilians and their
                                    property done by military action in a wide sense. Claims which
                                    are permissible under this head are described in detail in annex
                                    I to part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
                                <p>12. According to the Treaty of Versailles the assessment of the
                                    reparation claims of the Allies is the exclusive business of the
                                    Reparation Commission which is not merely an ‘exclusive
                                    collecting agency’ as the United States Government appear to
                                    suppose, but on the contrary is a general controlling agency set
                                    up by the treaty with jurisdiction over all the reparation
                                    claims of the powers contracting with Germany so as to ensure
                                    fairness and impartiality. If therefore the United States
                                    Government are to be admitted to a <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0218"/>share in the Dawes annuities, they will
                                    doubtless accept the view that such of their claims as may fall
                                    within annex I to part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles should,
                                    in equity, be fixed by the Reparation Commission in accordance
                                    with the rules on which all other reparation claims have been
                                    assessed. His Majesty’s Government do not suppose that the
                                    United States Government wish to claim the benefit of the Treaty
                                    of Versailles without its obligations, or to deprive the Allied
                                    Powers of a guarantee that the American reparation claims
                                    against Germany possess the same measure of validity and have
                                    been adjusted on the same principles as the Allied claims
                                    already admitted or to be admitted.</p>
                                <p>13. The view of the United States Government seems to be that
                                    there is no occasion for a reduction in respect to the limited
                                    classes of claims for which the United States seeks
                                    participation in the Dawes annuities. Even if limited to claims
                                    which would in the case of a party to the Versailles Treaty be
                                    admissible as reparations this view appears to His Majesty’s
                                    Government to be based upon a complete misapprehension, and on
                                    the hypothesis that the payments made under the Dawes Plan will
                                    suffice to satisfy in full the claims of the Allies for material
                                    damage. But this is not the case. The Dawes annuities, added to
                                    the sums already paid by Germany, will in fact not suffice to
                                    meet one-third of the assessed claims of the Allies, viz. 132
                                    milliard gold marks. The United States Government refer in this
                                    connection to the attitude they have taken in not claiming
                                    payment for war pensions and separation allowances. It is
                                    certainly true that the action of the United States Government
                                    in this matter, had they remained parties to the treaty, would
                                    have had the effect of increasing the share of the other
                                    signatory powers just as the action of the British Government in
                                    accepting the French scale of pensions and separation allowances
                                    greatly increased the shares of the other Allies. But such
                                    decisions when once formally taken are not subject to revocation
                                    and His Majesty’s Government cannot conceive that the United
                                    States Government, having granted this concession to Germany,
                                    now desire to withdraw it as against the Allies.</p>
                                <p>14. In fact, however, the claim submitted by the United States
                                    Government goes considerably beyond a mere request that their
                                    claim for damages should be met in like manner as the similar
                                    claims of the Allies. Future German payments will be
                                    insufficient by a wide margin to meet the Allied claims, so that
                                    the United States Government, if their claim were to be met in
                                    full, would be obtaining a substantially higher share of German
                                    payments than would have been due to them had they ratified the
                                    Treaty of Versailles. Even were the American general contention
                                    on the score of equity to be admitted, the most that the United
                                    States could ask for would be a percentage of the annuities
                                    based on a comparison of their total claim for reparations, when
                                    assessed, with the claims of the Allies.</p>
                                <p>15. Further it would be only equitable that the United States
                                    should account in the same way as Great Britain has accounted
                                    for the German ships detained by her. It will be recalled that
                                    the late President Wilson, while reserving the assent of
                                    Congress, accepted in May 1919 the agreement under which the
                                    excess value of ships so retained would be paid over to the
                                    Reparation Commission for the <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0219"/>credit of Germany.<note n="19" xml:id="d84fn19"><ref target="frus1920v02#pg_512"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1920, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 512</ref>.</note> This
                                    agreement expressly stated that the United States did not claim
                                    to take over these ships without payment. And yet the actual
                                    situation is that whilst Great Britain under the ton-for-ton
                                    agreement retained 30 percent of her war losses in tonnage, the
                                    United States has received 164 percent of her tonnage
                                    losses.</p>
                                <p>16. His Majesty’s Government in all these circumstances find it
                                    difficult to regard the United States Government’s claim as at
                                    present formulated as good in equity, any more than they are
                                    prepared to recognize it as just in law, and they sincerely
                                    regret that no specific proposal has been made by the United
                                    States Government for an amicable settlement of the matter in
                                    dispute.</p>
                                <p>17. Although the problem with which this note attempts to deal is
                                    difficult and complicated, I feel convinced that with the good
                                    will on both sides which I am sure exists, it ought to be
                                    possible to come to a fair arrangement satisfactory to both our
                                    Governments. It seems hardly possible, however, that the Allied
                                    Finance Ministers will be able to deal adequately with the
                                    question in Paris in the limited time at their disposal having
                                    regard to the urgency of decisions on general questions of
                                    distribution necessary for the success of the Dawes Plan. His
                                    Majesty’s Government therefore suggest that the best and most
                                    expeditious method of reaching a solution would be to submit the
                                    whole question to some body of impartial and independent persons
                                    mutually acceptable, such as a joint commission of three neutral
                                    persons to be nominated by the President of the Permanent Court
                                    at The Hague, which could review all the circumstances from the
                                    broadest points of view and come to equitable decisions on the
                                    various questions of fact and principle involved. If this
                                    suggestion were to commend itself to the United States
                                    Government His Majesty’s Government would lose no time in
                                    seeking the concurrence of their allies so that the actual
                                    constitution and terms of reference of such a commission might
                                    be determined”.</p></quote></p>

                        <p>495. I shall answer the British note as soon as possible.<note n="20" xml:id="d85fn20">See telegram no. 546, Dec. 31, from the Ambassador

                            and we should meet the British at Paris and show our readiness <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0220"/>for full discussion and
                            insistence on our rights. To do this can hardly fail to strengthen our
                            position while to acquiesce in delay would seem to aid British plan of
                            shelving discussion. We should make opposition of the British as
                            inconvenient for them as possible—being ready, at the same time, to
                            reach an amicable adjustment on a reasonable basis. To accomplish
                            results desired your presence in Paris seems to be absolutely necessary.

                        <p>11. L–301, from Logan. I doubt whether Bradbury<note n="22" xml:id="d87fn22">Sir John Bradbury, British representative on the

                            nature as the context indicates that it was drafted largely by
                            Leith-Ross and Fisher Williams of Bradbury’s staff. Bradbury’s comment,
                            expressed somewhat cynically, was (1) that the Army Costs Agreement of
                            May 25, 1923, was extremely difficult for the Allies in that it would
                            absorb all the foreign exchange that transfer committee would probably
                            be able to accumulate in the next 10 years, a longer time, in his
                            opinion, “than Dawes Plan would last”; (2) that our willingness to
                            extend period of the Army Costs Agreement and thereby to reduce the
                            annual cash priority in exchange for recognition <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0221"/>of our claims position carrying with it
                            only reichmark [payment?] was too good a business arrangement to be
                            ignored, and that this was the only basis of his support and the reason
                            why the British Treasury officials had taken more kindly to our
                            importunities.</p>

                            from the fact that we had not previously presented some definite scheme

                        <p>9. Please make the following reply to note contained in your No. 546,
                            December 31, 4 p.m.: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“My Government has instructed me to make reply to Your
                                    Excellency’s note of December 29, 1924, in relation to the
                                    participation of the United States in the payments to be made by
                                    Germany under the Dawes Plan.</p>
                                <p>My Government must express its disappointment at the tenor of
                                    Your Excellency’s communication, which is the more surprising in
                                    the light of the American contribution to insure the
                                    establishment of the Dawes Plan and thus to afford a basis for
                                    recoveries from Germany instead of a hopeless strife, and of the
                                    readiness of my Government, which I have heretofore stated, to
                                    make an arrangement whereby the total annual payments to the
                                    United States tor army costs and claims will not much exceed if
                                    at all the annual payments necessary to fulfill the present Army
                                    Cost Agreement. I may also observe, in relation to the matter of
                                    army costs, that while the American Army of Occupation was
                                    maintained at the request of the Allied Powers and with the
                                    clear right on the part of the United States to reimbursement
                                    under the Armistice Agreement, to say nothing of the provisions
                                    of the Treaty of Versailles, it was not until May, 1923, and
                                    after a prolonged negotiation that the United States was able to
                                    obtain an arrangement for its reimbursement. And then, in
                                    deference to the exigencies of the Allied Powers, my Government
                                    extended the time for the payment of these costs over a period
                                    of twelve years, without interest except with respect to arrears
                                    after 1927 of the promised annual installments. Notwithstanding
                                    the right of the United States to be paid its army costs on the
                                    same footing as the Allied Powers, the latter, including His
                                    Majesty’s Government, took for themselves the funds available
                                    for this purpose. Thus, by the arrangement of 1922 between the
                                    Allied Powers, Great <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0222"/>Britain received 500 million gold marks in cash to apply on
                                    her army costs which had accrued prior to May 1, 1921. And, as I
                                    have said, this was taken with definite notice of the claim of
                                    my Government which, however, for all practical purposes, was
                                    ignored. I have no desire to review the course of the later
                                    negotiations which were due to the insistence of the United
                                    States that its right and equity should be respected or to the
                                    difficulties raised by His Majesty’s Government in the course of
                                    the negotiations which finally resulted in the Army Cost
                                    Agreement of May 25, 1923, but I think it but fair that the
                                    forbearance of the United States in this matter and the fact
                                    that its appropriate reimbursement was withheld and finally
                                    extended by agreement over a period of years should receive
                                    appropriate consideration in determining its general equity.</p>
                                <p>I find no question raised in Your Excellency’s communication as
                                    to the all-embracing character of the payments contemplated by
                                    the Dawes Plan, which by its terms are to ‘comprise all amounts
                                    for which Germany may be liable to the Allied and Associated
                                    Powers for the costs arising out of the war, including
                                    reparation, restitution, all costs of all armies of occupation’,
                                    et cetera. I have not failed to note that Your Excellency
                                    insists that the Dawes committee had no power or competence to
                                    deal with the allocation of the annuities prescribed. It was not
                                    my purpose to contend that this committee had the power of
                                    allocation, but they certainly had the authority, and it was
                                    appropriate for them, in making the recommendation as to the
                                    extent of the payments to be made by Germany, to state that they
                                    made their calculations on the basis that these payments would
                                    include all the amounts for which Germany may be liable to the
                                    Allied and Associated Powers, obviously including the United
                                    States. The question raised by Your Excellency as to the
                                    allocation of the Dawes annuities would thus appear to mean
                                    nothing else than that the United States should be denied a
                                    share in the contemplated payments by Germany to apply upon the
                                    just claims of the United States, although these payments are
                                    all that Germany will be able to make. In the view of my
                                    Government, the allocation of the payments is a matter of plain
                                    justice when it appears that the determination of the amount of
                                    the payments has been thus based.</p>
                                <p>My Government believes that important progress has been made in
                                    reaching a basis of agreement when it is found, as Your
                                    Excellency states, that it is not the British contention ‘that
                                    one or more of the Allied and Associated Powers could properly
                                    make a separate agreement by which that Power or Powers would be
                                    entitled not simply to recover upon its own claims but to
                                    provide for the deprivation of co-belligerent states of
                                    satisfaction or remedy, nor that it is open to Powers who
                                    negotiated an earlier treaty lawfully to deprive third parties
                                    of their rights’. Yet it could hardly be denied that this would
                                    be the effect, if the Allied Powers under the Treaty of
                                    Versailles were to obtain a first and exclusive lien in their
                                    favor upon all the assets and revenues of Germany and thus leave
                                    the United States without any recourse to such assets for the
                                    satisfaction of its claims. My Government is unable to perceive
                                    the cogency of the reasoning by which it is admitted that it was
                                    not open to Powers who negotiate an earlier treaty lawfully to
                                    deprive third parties of their rights and yet it is attempted to
                                    assert that effect for the Treaty of Versailles. The argument
                                    appears to <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0223"/>be that the
                                    United States was compelled to ratify the Treaty of Versailles
                                    in order to retain its rights; or that the Allied Powers could
                                    accomplish the result of securing all the assets of Germany for
                                    their exclusive benefit by inviting the United States to join in
                                    a treaty containing unacceptable terms. The question is not one
                                    of assuming obligations under a treaty relative to the benefits
                                    it confers. It is safe to assume that the Allied Powers would
                                    not have made any treaty which failed to recognize the
                                    obligations of Germany for just claims of the classes put
                                    forward by the United States. Germany’s responsibility for these
                                    claims antedated the Treaty and the Allied Powers were not in a
                                    position, as my Government views it, to attempt to secure an
                                    exclusive charge upon all the assets of Germany for such claims
                                    by insisting that the United States should join in obligations
                                    or commitments not necessary to the enforcement of such claims
                                    separately considered but assumed for other purposes. If the
                                    Allied Powers were not in a position to make a treaty with
                                    Germany to deprive the United States of its rights, these Powers
                                    could not demand that the United States in order to safeguard
                                    these rights should join in a treaty upon terms satisfactory to
                                    them but not satisfactory to the United States.</p>
                                <p>It is unnecessary to consider the fact that the Treaty of
                                    Versailles was signed by representatives of the United States,
                                    for that Treaty by its terms was subject to ratification, and
                                    the Allied Powers were bound, in the case of the United States,
                                    to take note of the constitutional conditions of ratification.
                                    The Treaty itself contemplated the failure of ratification by
                                    the Powers whose representatives had signed it and it provided
                                    that it should become effective, as between the ratifying
                                    Powers, when it had been ratified by Germany and three of the
                                    Principal Allied and Associated Powers.</p>
                                <p>I must repeat that my Government is unable to reach any other
                                    conclusion than that the Allied Powers have no right in law or
                                    equity to take for their own benefit all the payments that
                                    Germany can make and deny participation to the United States for
                                    its proper claims. In this view, it is hardly necessary to
                                    consider the question of the effect of the various reservations
                                    heretofore made as to the rights of the United States. It cannot
                                    be said that the United States has released its rights. The
                                    question is not as to payments heretofore made but as to
                                    participation in payments to be made in the future under the
                                    Dawes Plan. It was my purpose in my previous communication to
                                    point out that the Dawes Plan contemplated payments which
                                    comprised all the amounts for which Germany may be liable to the
                                    United States as well as to the Allied Powers and that the
                                    Allied Powers adopted the plan at the London Conference with
                                    knowledge of this explicit provision and with full notice of the
                                    claims of the United States. I do not find in Your Excellency’s
                                    note anything in contravention of that statement.</p>
                                <p>It is noted that Your Excellency admits that ‘the Spa Conference
                                    of 1920 could not deprive the United States Government of any
                                    existing rights’. This being so, the question of reservations
                                    made in behalf of the United States with respect to the
                                    arrangements made at that Conference is not important. But my
                                    Government is unable to take the limited view of these
                                    reservations that Your Excellency suggests. Mr. Boyden’s
                                    statement to the Reparation <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0224"/>Commission on August 5, 1920,<note n="25" xml:id="d88fn25">See footnote 16, <ref target="#pg_121">p.
                                            121</ref>.</note> was specifically that the decisions at
                                    Spa to which the United States was not a party did ‘not affect
                                    the position of the United States.’ This was plainly as much so
                                    in one particular as in another. And it is not deemed to be open
                                    to argument that if these decisions did not affect the position
                                    of the United States as to army costs they would affect it in
                                    other respects. The sufficient answer is that they did not
                                    affect the rights of the United States at all, and Mr. Boyden so
                                    stated. With respect to the resolution of the Reparation
                                    Commission of September 10, 1920,<note n="26" xml:id="d88fn26">See footnote 17, <ref target="#pg_122">p. 122</ref>.</note>
                                    it appears from the minutes to which Your Excellency directs
                                    attention that Sir John Bradbury, in discussing the resolution
                                    drafted by him, made the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘The intention of the formula was in fact to indicate

                                            Powers which had signed it as regarded their relations
                                            with each other, but would have no force with regard to
                                            those Powers which were not signatories.’</p>
                                    </quote></p>
                                <p>And the Chairman of the Commission stated that</p>

                                        of the clauses of the Spa Arrangement was calculated to
                                        injure the rights and interests of the Powers which had not
                                        signed the Arrangement, this clause would not be carried
                                        out.’</p>
                                </quote>
                                <p>My Government concludes that not only was it beyond the
                                    competency of the Powers in their arrangements at Spa to affect
                                    the rights of the United States, but it was clearly stated in
                                    the meetings of the Commission that this was well understood by
                                    the Powers and had not been their intention.</p>
                                <p>Apart from the question of the legal rights of the United States,
                                    my Government does not believe that its equity with respect to
                                    all the classes of its claims under consideration can
                                    successfully be contested. With respect to the method of
                                    adjudication which has been adopted in relation to these claims,
                                    it may be said that my Government does not recognize the
                                    competency of the Allied Powers to constitute the Reparation
                                    Commission as an exclusive adjudicating agency. The comparison
                                    in equity, as it appears to my Government, should be with
                                    respect to the substantial justice of the method adopted. The
                                    claims of the United States are in process of determination by a
                                    Mixed Claims Commission constituted by agreement with Germany
                                    and in which Germany is represented. These claims have been
                                    subjected to a rigorous examination, to which the awards
                                    abundantly testify, and the United States does not shrink from a
                                    comparison of this method of adjudication with that adopted by
                                    the Reparation Commission in fixing the total of 132 milliards
                                    of gold marks as the amount to be paid by way of reparation to
                                    the Allied Powers.</p>
                                <p>In relation to particular categories of claims presented by the
                                    United States, it may be said that the item of pre-war debts is
                                    a relatively small one, embracing, it is believed, not more than
                                    10 percent of the total amount of the claims of the United
                                    States in question, that is, irrespective of army costs. In this
                                    connection it may be observed that under the Treaty of
                                    Versailles an optional <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0225"/>provision was made for what are called ‘clearing house’
                                    payments by which balances of debts owing by German nationals to
                                    nationals of the Allied Powers have been discharged. It is
                                    understood that about 600 million gold marks have been paid
                                    through this method to nationals of the Allied Powers of which
                                    Great Britain has received for its nationals considerably more
                                    than one-half.</p>
                                <p>This method, however, as I have said, was optional under the
                                    Treaty and those Powers who did not avail themselves of it could
                                    resort to an arbitral tribunal. A tribunal for this purpose has
                                    been set up under agreement between the United States and
                                    Germany and in asking appropriate allowance for the debts thus
                                    adjudicated my Government is unable to see that it is seeking to
                                    take any improper advantage of the Allied Powers.</p>
                                <p>As to the category of claims for damages to persons and property
                                    sustained before the United States was at war with Germany,
                                    there can hardly be a question that these constitute claims
                                    which the United States is entitled to enforce against Germany
                                    and that the Allied Powers by their Treaty with Germany are not
                                    entitled to deprive the United States of its rights of recourse.
                                    The Treaty of Versailles in permitting the resort to sequestered
                                    private property for the payment of such claims did not provide
                                    an exclusive remedy and it may be repeated that in the view of
                                    my Government it was not competent for the Allied Powers to
                                    insist upon recourse by the United States to such property. In
                                    its Treaty with Germany the United States has not forgone its
                                    claims of this category and it is believed that their justice is
                                    not open to dispute. I have pointed out in my previous note that
                                    with respect to sequestered private property the Treaty of
                                    Versailles gave an option to retain or to release it, as the
                                    Allied and Associated Powers might respectively determine, and I
                                    may add, by way of example, that I am advised that the Union of
                                    South Africa to a very considerable extent did release or
                                    otherwise made provision for the reimbursement to the owners of
                                    such property. Referring to your Excellency’s observation as to
                                    the German ships taken by the United States, I may repeat what I
                                    said in my communication of December 10, 1924,<note n="27" xml:id="d88fn27">See telegram no. 457, Dec. 9, to the

                                    as may be finally retained.</p>
                                <p>I have not failed to observe Your Excellency’s statement that the
                                    Dawes annuities added to the sums already paid by Germany would
                                    not suffice to meet one-third of the assessed claims of the
                                    Allies, that is 132 milliards gold marks. I may say, however,
                                    that if the United States had embraced in its claims the
                                    categories of pensions, allowances, et cetera, described in
                                    paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of Annex I of Part 8 of the Treaty of
                                    Versailles, its claims would have been much more than three
                                    times the amount of the American claims in question.</p>
                                <p>My Government has at all times been ready to consider an
                                    arrangement which would be relatively fair and reasonable. I may
                                    repeat what I said in my memorandum under date of November 15th,
                                        1924,<note n="28" xml:id="d88fn28"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_85">p. 85</ref>.</note>
                                    that it is the desire of the United States to facilitate in
                                    every way the settlement of the reparation question and
                                    therefore <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0226"/>that it is
                                    willing to recast the Army Cost Agreement and to make an
                                    extension of the time of payments provided a reasonable
                                    allowance is made upon its other claims. Thus it would appear to
                                    my Government to be practicable, and it would be willing, to
                                    make an arrangement (For possible insert here see end of [this]
                                    message) by which through a recasting of the Army Cost Agreement
                                    for an extended period with appropriate provision for priority
                                    as to the reduced annual payments the total amount of the annual
                                    payment to be made to the United States for army costs and on
                                    account of the claims in question would be substantially
                                    equivalent to the annual payment likely to be required under the
                                    present Army Cost Agreement. My Government is hopeful that, with
                                    good will on both sides, as Your Excellency suggests, a
                                    satisfactory arrangement can be reached on these lines.</p>
                                <p>It is not perceived that it would be necessary or appropriate to
                                    resort to arbitration. My Government would be unwilling to
                                    overlook the equities involved and notwithstanding its
                                    confidence in its legal position would be unwilling to limit
                                    itself to a discussion of merely legal questions appropriate to
                                    arbitral determination. An equitable arrangement mutually
                                    satisfactory should be more readily reached as between two
                                    Governments enjoying such friendly relations as happily exist
                                    between the United States and Great Britain. My Government
                                    believes that a resort to arbitral procedure would simply invite
                                    unnecessary delay, and my Government sees no reason why the
                                    matter cannot be dealt with adequately at the coming
                                    conference.”</p>

                                    1923, which would be a prior charge on future cash receipts and
                                    which would amount to from 45 to 50 million gold Marks per

                        <p>We are prepared to recast the Wadsworth Agreement, provided the Finance
                            Ministers Conference agrees to accord our Army Costs claims an absolute
                            foreign exchange cash priority annuity of 65 million gold Marks over a
                            period of approximately 19 years from September 1, 1924, the date of the
                            commencement of the first Dawes annuity. The balances which have already
                            accrued to our Army Cost account through payments falling due before the
                            going into effect of the Dawes Report are not to be considered as
                            Annuities, but are to be credited to the capital amount of our Army Cost
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing proposition is advanced solely on the condition that
                            satisfaction is given with respect to other American claims.</p>
                        <p>As already admitted by all concerned, our Army Cost annuities have a
                            priority immediately after the cash priorities incident to the service
                            of the recent 800 million gold Marks loan and after such limited amounts
                            of foreign exchange as may be necessary to meet the cost of the
                            Reparation Commission including the Dawes organizations, the
                            Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission and the Military Control
                            Commissions, and immediately before any other priorities. This priority
                            and the provision that any arrears after 1927 shall bear interest will,
                            of course, be maintained. As the amount of foreign exchange available
                            during the first one or two years of the operation of the Dawes Plan
                            will in all probability be limited, which might possibly mean that the
                            United States would not receive in these two years the full annuities in
                            respect of the American Army Costs, it is felt that the figure of 65
                            million is fair and reasonable.</p>

                            American claims, the following statement in your letter is noted: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) “The other claims would be met by an

                                    expressed as a percentage of the Dawes annuity, i. e., as the
                                    annual payments in the normal year are fixed at 2½ milliards,
                                    the percentage required would not exceed 2%. These payments
                                    would not be entitled to any priority and would be transferred
                                        <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> with the reparation shares
                                    of the Allied Powers.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>You are quite correct in your statement that we do not ask any priority
                            in payment of these claims over the so-called “Reparation” <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0228"/>claims of the Allies. We do, however,
                            expect to participate in the annuities on as favorable a basis as that
                            accorded the Allied Powers.</p>
                        <p>Our claims, other than Army Costs, are, as you know, in the neighborhood
                            of 350 million dollars. In respect of these claims, it is intended that
                            they should be met by an annual payment of about 60 million gold Marks
                            per annum, expressed as a percentage of the net Dawes Annuities after
                            allowing for priorities. The exact percentages cannot, of course, be
                            determined at this time, in view of the unsettled position of the
                            various priorities. It naturally follows that any decision reached
                            relating to priorities must be in agreement with the United States, and,
                            in addition, we must be in a position similarly to consider any foreign
                            exchange priorities that may be accorded.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Belgian War debt:</hi> We are naturally interested
                            in any arrangement made for payments on account of the Belgian War Debt.
                            In the absence of definite instructions from Washington, this point must
                            be reserved for later.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Remarks:</hi> The fact must not be overlooked that
                            under the Wadsworth Agreement we are entitled to the benefit of 21
                            million dollars (i. e., approximately 88 million gold marks) per annum
                            during a period of 12 years from January 1, 1923. Attention is also
                            invited to the fact that any arrears in the payments during the first
                            four years of the currency of the Wadsworth Agreement, must be made good
                            in the last 8 years. As such arrears have actually occurred and as they
                            probably will reoccur in the next one or two years, we would be entitled
                            from January 1, 1927, to a total annual amount in respect of Army Costs
                            of between 30 and 32 million dollars (i. e., between 126 and 134 million
                            gold marks). In view of this latter situation it will be noted that the
                            amount requisite for payment of all our claims under the Dawes
                            Annuities, as outlined above, would be less annually than the amounts
                            provided for under the Wadsworth Agreement for our Army Costs alone,
                            although extended over a longer period of time. Furthermore, (so far as
                            the Dawes Annuities are concerned), we would not claim an absolute
                            priority for the total of these annuities as is the case of the
                            annuities payable under the Wadsworth Agreement, but only a priority for
                            the portion received in respect of Army Costs. Therefore, in its
                            entirety, and <hi rend="italic">vis a vis</hi> the payments which we
                            would otherwise be entitled to under the Wadsworth Agreement, we
                            consider the foregoing entirely fair and in fact a liberal concession in
                            deference to the Allies.</p>

                            <item>In a confidential conversation on the set-up of the personnel of
                                controls provided for in the experts’ report, Bradbury<note n="34" xml:id="d90fn34">Sir John Bradbury, British representative on
                                    the Reparation Commission.</note> stated that the present
                                British attitude is that the Agent General is to be an American; he
                                intimated that the city of London is pushing Dwight Morrow. At risk
                                of being misunderstood I venture nevertheless to suggest that an
                                eminent banker, especially from Wall Street, is not the best choice
                                for the post, if present political psychology in Europe with strong
                                socialist and anti-capitalist trend be taken into consideration.
                                There is already a not inconsiderable attack, only partly veiled, on
                                the experts’ plan on general ground that it represents capitalistic
                                dictation of Wall Street and city of London. This criticism would be
                                crystallized and confirmed by banker’s appointment from Great
                                Britain or the United States. Poincare has been particularly
                                outspoken about such influences. I fully appreciate Morrow’s special
                                and undoubted equipment for the job, and the effect that his
                                appointment might have on the flotation of a loan in the United
                                States.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>It is, however, a question whether even these advantages are not
                            counterbalanced by risk of future trouble not merely in Germany but also
                            in the Allied countries where socialistic tendencies are quick to attack
                            anything which has a semblance of capitalistic domination. The plan will
                            be difficult enough to work out without any handicaps of this nature. I
                            feel confident that the Department will appreciate that I am endeavoring
                            to express a wholly impersonal view, that Morrow is a personal friend
                            and that the objects of my remarks are best interests of the plan and of
                            American unofficial participation therein as I see them. …</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>From what I gather from talking with Bradbury, the designation of the
                            Agent General would practically be arranged in London within the coming
                            week and the other appointments would follow shortly thereafter.

                            office this morning. Stated purpose of meeting was to discuss choice of

                            contemplated by Dawes report. It developed during meeting that there was
                            unanimous desire, with Governments also agreeing, for appointment of an
                            American as Agent General. Barthou predicated French agreement to

                            by “appointment by a majority vote of the foreign members of the board
                            of directors” of the railways. Barthou said the French Government does
                            not want any other of the principal positions under plan for its
                            nationals but that before accepting other nationals to offices within
                            gift of commission would require assurances of other Governments through

                            Leverve would be the French nominee. The Italian and Belgian delegates
                            intimated that their Governments were ready to support Leverve and that
                            the necessary assurances for such appointment would be forthcoming at an

                        <p>213. L–94, for Logan. Your L–185, July 2, 7 p.m. Morrow finds it
                            impossible, for personal reasons, to consider appointment, and his name
                            will be withdrawn from consideration. The present prospect is that Owen
                            Young will be willing to accept appointment, under certain conditions,
                            for a definite time. Question of appointment should be held in abeyance
                            until London Conference, when whole situation will be discussed. Owen
                            Young sails July 5 on the <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>. During the

                        <p>302. Following has been received from the President: “I would prefer
                            Young but entirely satisfied with Gilbert.” Of course it is understood
                            that suggestion should come in the proper way from Governments
                            represented on Reparation Commission and should have approval of
                            Germany.</p>

                        <p>354. I think Young should accept position of Agent General even if he has
                            to retire within a few months. There is no opposition from any
                            Government to him, and he will be of the greatest use in starting the
                            plan. I believe he will be satisfactory to all the financial
                            interests.</p>

                        <p>359. Young canceled his sailing reservations for tomorrow. He will go to
                            Paris and work out plan of reparations as Agent General. I think that it
                            will be arranged to carry out your original program for his temporary
                            appointment to start the Dawes Plan in operation. He hopes that
                            arrangement as to permanent Agent General may be reached as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                                <item>The sum of approximately 100,000,000 gold marks is on deposit

                                    jointly by Belgium and France. France is agreeable to handing
                                    this sum over to Belgium directly for application on Belgian
                                    priority, deeming it to be reparation money.</item>

                                <item>To avoid at this important juncture raising difficult
                                    questions of the legality of the Ruhr occupation and Belgian

                                    prefer not to put this money through the Reparation Commission

                                            carry its suggestion into effect by causing the Banque
                                            Nationale de Belgique to open a special account in the
                                            Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be known as the

                        <p>171. L–76, for Logan. Your L–161, May 13, 3 p.m. The Department has noted
                            your statement that British member of Reparation Commission does not
                            object to proposed disposition of funds in question which you state will
                            constitute a cash reparation payment by Germany. The Department assumes
                            that the Belgian Government has already obtained or will obtain assent
                            of the other Governments concerned to the special agreement, that is, to
                            the payment of this money directly to Belgium to apply on Belgian
                            priority, and that, furthermore, those Governments having an interest
                            have consented or will consent to the Belgian proposal to set aside 25
                            percent of the amount in a blocked account for American Army costs to
                            await ratification of the Army Costs Agreement. Of course you will
                            realize that the Government of the United States would not desire to be
                            thought of as expressing any opinion either in regard to the special
                            agreement proposed or to the funds in question.</p>
                        <p>On the understandings set forth above, the Government of the United
                            States would have no objection were the Belgian Government, in view of
                            Bemelmans’ letter of November 22, 1923,<note n="50" xml:id="d101fn50">Not printed.</note> to set up a special account in favor of
                            American Army costs. You may state this orally to your Belgian colleague
                            in reply to his oral inquiry and you may confirm your statement in
                            writing within the foregoing limits in answering any written proposal by
                            him along lines of his statement to you reported in your telegram of May
                            13, 3 p.m. Before you make any reply, telegraph text of any
                            communication you receive from him and text of reply you propose to
                            make.</p>

                        <p>1. Reference to Department’s telegram L–76, May 28, 6 p.m. I am in
                            receipt of the following letter from Gutt, the Belgian assistant
                            delegate on the Reparation Commission, dated June 14, 1924:<note n="52" xml:id="d102fn52">Quoted letter not paraphrased.</note>

                                    course should be deposited with the Reparation Commission.</p>
                                <p>In order that this deposit may not give rise to discussions which
                                    everyone agrees are superfluous at this time and inasmuch as it
                                    appears certain that the Reparation Commission itself would
                                    allocate these sums to the Belgian priority under reserve of
                                    such rights as may accrue to the United States under the
                                    agreement of May 25, 1923, it has been decided that the sums in
                                    question shall be turned over directly to Belgium, Belgium
                                    remaining accountable for them to the Reparation Commission and
                                    eventually to the United States for the portion which may be

                                    deposit in a special blocked account 25 per cent of the cash
                                    above referred to.</p>

                        <p>2. Unless I shall receive instructions to the contrary, I shall reply
                            using language reported in my L–161, May 13, 3 p.m., paragraph 6, except
                            that it now seems likely that the first paragraph will be eliminated
                            entirely and the second paragraph will contain the following

                                <p>“In acknowledging your courteous letter of June 14, 1924,

                        <p>3. The Department will observe that Belgian letter states that Belgium
                            will in any event be accountable to Reparation Commission for the funds.
                            Taking into consideration this assurance as well as <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0238"/>the individual informal approval of the
                            delegates to present procedure and also the further fact that under the
                            existing agreements it seems clear that the Belgians are entitled to
                            priority on this payment, I do not see how our Government can be
                            prejudiced by acquiescing in opening of this account. The suggestion
                            made in Department’s telegram L–76, May 28, 6 p.m., that the Belgians be
                            requested to obtain advance consent of all interested Governments in
                            opening this special account, is not practicable, for to obtain this
                            formal consent would of necessity bring up very discussion which both
                            Belgians and individual delegates wish wholly to avoid, that is,
                            question of source of the funds. If, as is virtually certain, the
                            Belgians are entitled to this money, it is somewhat anomalous, moreover,
                            for them to ask permission of the other powers to dispose of their own
                            funds in legitimate ways as they deem proper. Furthermore, the French
                            Parliament not yet having ratified the Army Costs Agreement, the new
                            French Government might hesitate to commit itself so definitely before
                            obtaining legislative opinion. For these reasons I suggest that the
                            Department waive this proposed step.</p>
                        <p>4. If the experts’ plan is put into execution, as appears more probable
                            daily, I feel reasonably confident that the Ruhr episode will give rise
                            to no further discussion by the Allies among themselves and that past
                            differences will not be reawakened. The only effect will be that in
                            rearrangement of financial payments for the future, naturally some
                            weight will be given to fact that Belgium has received some proceeds
                            from this source. In the state of feeling here at present, I think that
                            no one would object to allocation of portion of this sum to American
                            Army costs, particularly as this would be helpful to all the Allies by
                            reducing the amount due to us. If we do not accept the Belgian offer or
                            if we bring forward conditions and qualifications to put off acceptance,
                            it is my opinion that we would merely be throwing away the first
                            excellent opportunity we have had to obtain real money. Logan.</p>

                            to the Belgian letter: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I beg to acknowledge your courteous letter of June 14 relative
                                    to certain sums on deposit with La Comptabilité des Gages which
                                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0239"/>you state should,

                                    at this time and inasmuch as it appears certain that the
                                    Reparation Commission itself would allocate these sums to the
                                    Belgian priority under reserve of such rights as may accrue to
                                    the United States under the agreement of May 25, 1923, it has
                                    been decided that the sums in question shall be turned over
                                    directly to Belgium, Belgium remaining accountable for them to
                                    the Reparation Commission and eventually to the United States
                                    for the portion which may be payable to it’. You add that in
                                    conformity with the letter which Mr. Bemelmans addressed to me
                                    on November 22, 1923, the Belgian Government is ready to deposit
                                    in a special blocked account 25 percent of the cash above
                                    referred to, and you request to be informed of the desires of my
                                    Government in the matter.</p>
                                <p>My Government, understanding from your letter that the Allied
                                    Governments signatories of the Army Cost Agreement are agreeable
                                    to the proposed disposition of the funds in question, is
                                    prepared to accept the suggestion which you have made concerning
                                    the amount which it is proposed to set aside for payment in due
                                    course to the credit of the American Army Cost account. My
                                    Government will be pleased should the Belgian Government see fit
                                    to carry its suggestion into effect by causing a special account
                                    to be opened in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be known
                                    as the ‘American Army Costs Account’ in which shall be deposited
                                    in dollars the proper proportion of the sums in question and
                                    withdrawals from which shall be made upon the order of the

                            <item>Belgian letter states, however, that it considers that the
                                exchange rate should be computed as of the day currencies were
                                received by Belgium and credited at the same value as they were
                                debited to Belgium. The sums above referred to were received on May
                                25, June 16 and June 26, three-fourths of the total on the first
                                date and approximately one-eighth on each succeeding date. There was
                                debited to Belgium on May 25, 91,000,000 gold marks, on June 16,
                                16,000,000 gold marks, on June 29, 20,000,000 gold marks. Total
                                debited 127,000,000 gold marks. Belgium wishes to debit our
                                contingent Army costs account 31,750,000 gold marks in return for
                                the deposit in the special account of all the foreign moneys listed
                                above. Belgian letter points out that they have long been ready to
                                deposit these sums and that therefore they should not suffer any
                                loss because of falling exchange. Also understand that foreign
                                treasuries would like to avoid the extensive effect on exchange of
                                the immediate conversion of the sums mentioned above.</item>

                            <item>First request has some plausibility in view of the fact that had
                                we previously accepted Belgian offer sums would have been deposited
                                as received. Perhaps situation could be somewhat reconciled by
                                crediting Belgium as requested but crediting Germany only with
                                dollar values actually received. The request concerning delaying
                                conversion is somewhat inconsistent but suggest that this subject be
                                referred to the Treasury to determine whether there is not some
                                method of exchanging the funds with minimum effect on market.</item>

                        <p>225. For Logan: L–100. Your L–188.<note n="56" xml:id="d105fn56"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note></p>
                        <p>1. Department had understood from paragraph 7th your L–161, May 13, and
                            from your draft reply in paragraph 6 that money was being set aside in
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>2. Department is not aware of any means whereby there could properly be
                            credited against American army cost claim amounts in <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0241"/>excess of the sums actually received in
                            dollars or their equivalent. It appears that question of amounts to be
                            debited to Belgium does not directly concern the United States.
                            Nevertheless, if certain sums are actually set aside for conditional
                            payment to the United States this Government is interested as are Allied
                            Governments in maintaining their dollar value intact, and to this end it
                            is desirable that sums in paper currencies should forthwith be converted
                            to avoid possible loss by depreciation. It is noted, however, that
                            foreign treasuries are understood to wish to avoid immediate conversion
                            because of possible effect on exchange. As a practical means of
                            effecting conversion, Federal Reserve Bank of New York would be prepared
                            to accept blocked account to its credit in local currencies with state
                            banks of various countries, with right to convert to dollars when deemed
                            advisable by it protecting exchange so far as possible. Amount involved
                            should not create much difficulty in exchange, and our interest would be
                            to convert without undue loss. Belgium presumably could be credited with
                            sums set aside at their value when received by Belgium, and when sums
                            ultimately received by our Treasury American Army cost account will be
                            credited with dollar value of currencies at time credited to Federal
                            Reserve Bank. If right to convert to dollars at option Federal Reserve
                            Bank not accorded, credit on American Army cost account can only be
                            given at value of foreign currencies in dollars when received by our
                            Treasury.</p>
                        <p>If sums credited to Federal Reserve Bank, it should be authorized to
                            invest funds abroad pending conversion, or here after conversion, at
                            risk of United States, awaiting final disposition and interest earned to
                            follow funds.</p>
                        <p>3. Please repeat figures your first paragraph since figures as received
                            are equivalent at present exchange to about 51,500,000 gold marks, not
                            31,750,000.</p>

                        <p>1. Answering Department’s L–103.<note n="58" xml:id="d107fn58"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> Action of Belgian National
                            [Bank] is consequence of Department’s L–100, July 8th, substance of
                            which communicated through Belgian assistant delegate.</p>
                        <p>2. Due absence from Paris have just received assistant delegate’s reply,
                            dated July 12th, which accepts our conditions concerning conversion and
                            investment of funds and states in pertinent part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I note that the United States is agreed that Belgium will be
                                    credited with the amount that she will transfer the value to be
                                    taken at the time of its receipt by Belgium. I note also the
                                    desire of the American Government to be debited on the account
                                    of the Armies of Occupation with the value of this currency at
                                    the time of its conversion into dollars. My Government is quite
                                    disposed to back up this request as far as it is in its
                                    power”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>3. In my letter to Belgian assistant delegate paraphrasing your L–100 I
                            copied verbatim so much of your cable as read, “Belgium presumably could
                            be credited with sums set aside at their value when received by Belgium;
                            and when sums ultimately received by our Treasury, American Army costs
                            account will be credited with dollar value of currency at time credited
                            to Federal Reserve Bank”.</p>
                        <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0243"/>
                        <p>4. Understand that Belgium is accepting all our conditions and that
                            purport of remark about “backing up request” is that she feels that
                            alone is not competent in view of co-interest of the Allies to give a
                            final declaration binding on all concerned as to the amount which should
                            be debited on our Army costs.</p>
                        <p>5. Under all the circumstances believe money should be accepted in
                            special account and procedure of your L–100 followed with reference to
                            conversion. Logan.</p>

                                suggested deposits to the credit of Federal Reserve Bank, New York,
                                which would hold as third person until agreement effective or until
                                withdrawn prior thereto in accord with Commission or governments,
                                but from cables received it is apparent deposits have been made to
                                the credit of Treasury of the United States. Treasury can hold this
                                as special deposit account but should have the authority to invest
                                and convert into dollars which Department’s L–100 suggested for
                                Federal Reserve Bank.</item>

                                Bank. Your quotation from reply of Belgian Assistant Delegate
                                mentions value at time of conversion into dollars which would
                                necessarily be later. The latter more favorable to the United States
                                if fully understood by all parties.</item>

                            <item>Department does not understand from your third paragraph L–197 to
                                what extent you informed Belgians of statements contained paragraph
                                2 Department’s L–100, particularly since Belgian reply states “that
                                the United States is agreed that Belgium will be credited with the
                                amount that she will transfer the value to be taken at the time of
                                its receipt by Belgium.” As stated paragraph 2 Department’s L–100
                                question of amounts to be debited to Belgium does not directly
                                concern the United States. Subsequent statement that “Belgium could
                                presumably be credited with sums set aside at their value when
                                received by Belgium” was not intended and should <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0244"/>not be taken to modify previous
                                proposition that this does not directly concern the United States.
                                Please make clear to Belgians our position. We are not concerned
                                with amounts to be credited to Belgium, but with actual amount to be
                                paid into blocked account for which Treasury will be accountable.
                                Our complete proposition which you should make clear to Belgians is
                                this: The Treasury will accept special blocked account to be held
                                until Army cost agreement effective or until withdrawn prior thereto
                                for the United States in accord with Commission or governments. If
                                funds go to the United States, Treasury will credit to army cost
                                account funds so deposited to its credit in New York and in national
                                banks of various countries at the present dollar value of the
                                currencies at the date of such deposits to its credit; Treasury to
                                have the right to convert foreign currencies into dollars at its
                                option and to invest funds abroad or here; interest earned to follow
                                final disposition of funds. If funds do not go to United States,
                                Treasury would be relieved by payment of funds in currencies
                                originally credited to it or by payment of dollars for all or part
                                of the funds which may have been converted into dollars plus
                                interest earned, if any.</item>

                        <p>1. Just received following letter from assistant Belgian delegate: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I acknowledge your further letter July 29. I observe with
                                    pleasure that one of the possible difficulties is adjusted
                                    inasmuch as the Treasury of the United States agrees to credit
                                    on account of the costs of Armies of Occupation the gold value
                                    of the currencies which we turned over to it, such gold value to
                                    be calculated at the time of our deposit. I am in accord with
                                    you also as to the use which the United States Treasury may make
                                    of these funds.</p>
                                <p>There remains the question of the difference in exchange upon the
                                    first sums which we received, a difference which arose between
                                    the time when we received and put these funds at your
                                    disposition and the time when you accepted the deposit. You do
                                    not put any objection to the suggestion that we should not
                                    suffer any loss in <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0245"/>exchange upon these deposits. This is especially logical
                                    because in reality we have acted for and on behalf of the
                                    Reparation Commission which in ordinary course would have
                                    received the total amount of German payments and would have
                                    turned over to you 25 percent thereof so that Belgium on this
                                    head would not have suffered any loss or any profit.</p>
                                <p>The current exchange movements make us hope that no question of
                                    loss will in fact arise but we anticipate should there be any
                                    loss that the United States will support the Belgian point of
                                    view before the Reparation Commission to the effect that the
                                    common pool should bear such loss instead of the Belgian
                                    Government which is wholly without fault in the matter. On the
                                    other hand should the Reparation Commission for any reason
                                    consider that the United States should be debited with 25
                                    percent of the funds as of their value when received by Belgium,
                                    Belgium would equally support the point of view that the United
                                    States should be debited only with what it received and that the
                                    common pool should bear the differential.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. My letter of July 29 called attention to the fact that we were
                            awaiting answer. Hope it will be possible to act on present Belgian
                            letter. Consider last paragraph principally for home use. Should
                            Reparation Commission at any time endeavor to charge us with more than
                            we receive we can always deny its jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>298. For Logan. L–112. Your L–203, August 8, 4 p.m. Please inform Belgian
                            Assistant Delegate that the Treasury understands that Belgium has
                            accepted proposition submitted in paragraph 3 of Dept’s telegram of July
                            15 and that the Treasury is acting in accordance with this
                            understanding. In case you feel that a further statement is necessary
                            you may add that the Government of the United States notes that Belgium
                            is in accord with the view that the Government of the United States
                            should be debited only with what it may actually receive, and you may
                            state further that the Government of the United States, as previously
                            indicated, is not directly concerned with the question of amounts to be
                            debited to Belgium by the Reparation Commission, but that this
                            Government sees no objection to the suggestion that Belgium should not
                            suffer any loss by exchange upon these deposits.</p>

                                be applied to reparation. It follows that in any event Department
                                must take definite position on asserting right to participation for
                                our Army costs in Bulgarian payments which are applied to

                            <item>I fear that though the Bulgarian payment is at present in a
                                blocked account, the blockade might be lifted suddenly, and the

                                we would be faced with a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi>, which
                                would provide the Allies with a strong tactical position. Past
                                experience demonstrates amply that once cash has been distributed it
                                is almost impossible <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0247"/>to
                                recover it, but if I have clear instructions ahead of time on
                                Department’s attitude, I shall be able to take appropriate
                                conservatory-action when the blockade on the payment is lifted, or
                                at any other time that seems most opportune so that our claim will
                                be given full consideration.</item>

                            <item>I do not think the Reparation Commission is competent to interpret
                                the Army Costs Agreement without a mandate from the powers and the
                                United States. The powers might tacitly assent to the action of
                                their delegates. If the delegates oppose claim of our Government, I
                                would reserve all rights. The Department should be prepared on the
                                next step to take, that is, either reference for arbitration to some
                                personage or body, or diplomatic parleys with the Allied Powers. The
                                latter course would, however, doubtless make for delay.

                        <p>48. L–47, for Logan. Your L–86, February 1, 5 p.m. If, as appears to be
                            the fact, the amount of reparation assessed against Germany also
                            includes the amount for damages caused by her allies, then obviously any
                            payments made by the latter on their reparation accounts should be set
                            down as credits against Germany’s obligations. This principle is
                            implicit in article 1 (c), Schedule of Payments, and in paragraph 11,
                            Finance Ministers’ Agreement. The Department believes, therefore, that
                            unless Bulgarian payments are used to cover Army of Occupation costs in
                            Bulgaria, or costs of commission of control, or possibly the service of
                            the external Ottoman debt referred to in the Treaty of Neuilly, article
                            135, they should be credited to the reparation account of Germany; and
                            if these payments are credited in this way then the charge created in
                            favor of the Government of the United States by paragraph 3 under
                            article 2 of the Army Costs Agreement would apply when the agreement
                            goes into effect.</p>
                        <p>If Bulgarian payments are credited to the reparation account of Germany
                            and should the question of American participation therein arise, the
                            Department desires, in accordance with the facts set forth in the above
                            paragraph, that you support our right to participation before the
                            commission in such manner as to indicate that this Government has taken
                            it for granted that the Army Costs Agreement would be held to apply, and
                            that a share of the Bulgarian payments <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0248"/>would be set aside for payment to the United States
                            when the Army Costs Agreement is finally ratified.</p>
                        <p>The Department agrees with you that the Reparation Commission is not
                            competent to settle any disputed question of interpretation of the Army
                            Costs Agreement without a specific mandate from the signatory powers,
                            and should the commission oppose our participation under that agreement
                            in Bulgarian reparation payments credited to Germany, you should, as you
                            stated, reserve all rights for the United States.</p>
                        <p>If an attempt should in the meantime be made to release the blocked
                            Bulgarian account, you may take appropriate steps to prevent this, and
                            advise Department promptly.</p>

                                28th, 1924, between the Bulgarian Government and the representatives
                                of Great Britain, Italy and France, subject to ratification of all
                                four Governments, it has been stipulated that the cost of the Armies
                                of Occupation in, Bulgaria shall be fixed at an all inclusive sum of
                                25 million gold francs and that payment therefor shall be spread
                                over a period of 10 years commencing on September 30, 1924, with a
                                payment of 1,250,000 gold francs. The Bulgarian Government assigns
                                the revenues of the customs to discharge of these costs.</item>

                                in adjustment of her reparation obligations “unless and until claims

                            <item>If the agreement is ratified, it seems almost certain that
                                Bulgaria’s other payments will be wholly free for application to
                                reparations and consequently, as hitherto outlined, this will
                                involve a credit on Germany’s reparation account by reduction of C
                                bonds. Finance Service of commission is now working on question of

                                money. Seems likely that United States can only claim participation
                                in sums received by those countries who were signatories to or

                            question to their respective Governments. In view of your L–47 and
                            relation to question to [<hi rend="italic">of</hi>] army costs I made
                            following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The report of the Finance Service now under consideration states
                                    that it has not taken into account the possibility of any claim
                                    being made by the United States Government against the Bulgarian
                                    payments since the agreement of May 25, 1923 has not yet been
                                    ratified.</p>
                                <p>I permit myself to call the attention of the commission to
                                    decision number 2751 of December 16, 1923 by which the
                                    commission took conservative measures and created a special
                                    blocked account into which was to be deposited that proportion
                                    of all accruing cash payments which are available for the
                                    reimbursement of the American Army costs.</p>
                                <p>Pursuant to the terms of that decision, therefore, it would
                                    appear that even though the American Army Cost[s] Agreement has
                                    not yet been ratified, the proper proportion of all accruing
                                    cash payments applicable to those costs under the terms of the
                                    agreement should be placed in this account.</p>
                                <p>Upon the instructions of my Government I desire to say that the
                                    Bulgarian payments are considered by it as applicable to the
                                    American Army costs pursuant to the ratification of the pending
                                    Army Cost[s] Agreement, particularly paragraph 3 of article 2
                                    thereon. If credited to Bulgaria’s reparation account as now
                                    contemplated it would seem that they must simultaneously and
                                    automatically be applied to the reparation account of Germany
                                    and as such fall within the scope of Army Cost[s] Agreement.</p>

                                <p>I desire to make the position of the United States a formal
                                    matter of record and to state that the Bulgarian cash payments
                                    if credited on Germany’s reparation account should in the proper
                                    proportion be placed in the special account created by decision
                                    2751 when they are released from the account where they now
                                    are.</p>
                                <p>I note the decision just taken by Reparation Commission and I
                                    will be obliged if the delegates in referring this matter to
                                    their respective governments would at the same time call the
                                    attention of these governments to the remarks which I have just
                                    made. Furthermore I would appreciate it were the decision of the
                                    commission to be so worded as to contain an invitation to the
                                    delegates to follow the course I have just suggested.”</p>

                        <p>1. While Department agrees that stockholders have no legal title to the
                            assets of a corporation, it is entirely unable to concur in intimated
                            decision of Tribunal that stockholders have no equitable or beneficial
                            interest in corporation’s assets. Not only have text writers and the
                            courts repeatedly recognized the beneficial interest of shareholders in
                            corporation’s assets, but governments have repeatedly lent diplomatic
                            assistance to support such beneficial interest. As to the position of
                            governments in this respect, see cases cited in Section 20, pages 58 to
                            74 of first brief filed with Tribunal by Standard Oil. See quotations in
                            Section 19 from Morawetz and German Text Writers. See also German and
                            American cases cited in that section, and particularly the opinion of
                            the Supreme Court in <hi rend="italic">Bacon</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Robinson</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Robertson</hi>], page 46, wherein
                            the court in part stated that it was the tendency of the courts of the
                            United States and Great Britain: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“to concede the existence of a distinct and positive right of

                                    management and control of the corporation itself; but that cases
                                    may arise where the <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0251"/>corporators may assert not only their own rights but the

                        <p>Attention is also called to the following American decisions: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    which the laws provide for their management.” <hi rend="italic">Doherty and Company</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Rice</hi> 186
                                    Fed. Rep. 212.</p>
                                <p>“It is true that a corporation holds the legal title of, and the
                                    right to manage, control, and convey, its property, and that a
                                    stockholder is without that title and right. But, after all, the
                                    corporation is nothing but the hand or tool of the stockholders,
                                    in which they hold its property for their benefit. They are the
                                    equitable and beneficial owners of all its property, and it is
                                    the mere holder and manager of it for them. The benefit of every
                                    increase in the value of its property is their benefit, and the
                                    injury or every decrease of the value of its property is their
                                    injury. They may, by appropriate action [at] any time require
                                    and compel it to sell all its property and to distribute its
                                    proceeds among them. … So in reality, as against its
                                    stockholders, a corporation has no, and they have all the
                                    beneficial interest in its property.” <hi rend="italic">Lynch</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Turrish</hi>, 236 Fed. Rep.

                        <p>These decisions establish very clearly that stockholders are the

                        <p>2. The intimated decision of the Tribunal is diametrically opposed to the
                            action taken by the French and British Governments subsequent to the
                            outbreak of the war with respect to tankers belonging to the D. A. P. G.
                            As indicated in the Department’s L–20,<note n="71" xml:id="d115fn71"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_213"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>,
                                    p. 213</ref>.</note> these Governments, in view of the
                            recognized beneficial ownership of the Standard Oil, permitted the
                            tankers to be transferred to the American flag. In fact, in the case of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Leda</hi> the bond required by the British
                            Government expressly recited that application had been made on the

                            had agreed to release the ship to the Standard Oil Company.</p>
                        <p>3. In view of the position taken by courts and governments as above
                            indicated, Department does not perceive how the Tribunal could decide as
                            intimated. Furthermore, such a decision would be precluded by the
                            recognition by the British and French Governments, with respect to this
                            very company, of the principle of beneficial ownership in the
                            stockholders.</p>

                            never in any way questioned, although it is true Bradbury<note n="72" xml:id="d115fn72">Sir John Bradbury, British representative on the

                            considered beneficial ownership. This objection it seems was largely
                            based on the fear of such a definition creating a precedent which might
                            embarrass the Reparation Commission in other cases, while the tanker
                            case was considered to be a special one. The fact that the wording of
                            the Agreement was modified from time to time in no way indicated a
                            change in the views of the United States. These were consistently
                            maintained. See Boyden’s B–56, April 29, 1920,<note n="74" xml:id="d115fn74">Not printed.</note> paragraphs fifth to twelfth.
                            Note particularly that, notwithstanding Bradbury’s statement of his
                            understanding in paragraph eighth, Boyden reiterated that the
                            understanding of the United States was that tankers were to be
                            surrendered in proportion to ownership of securities. Note also
                            paragraph ninth, and Bradbury’s view in paragraphs tenth and eleventh.

                                    512</ref>.</note> Indeed this Government has previously pointed
                            out that both paragraphs were adopted in contemplation of tanker
                            situation. Note in this respect Department’s 3532, October 22,
                                1919,<note n="79" xml:id="d115fn79"><ref target="frus1920v02#pg_554"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 554</ref>.</note> to
                            American Mission. It is clear from a review of the tanker discussion
                            that neither United States nor other negotiators considered that
                            paragraph 20 had limited meaning apparently given it by Reparation
                            Commission. Neither the United States nor the Tribunal in any way bound
                            by Commission’s interpretation. In fact, the Commission expressly
                            recognized its decision without prejudice to tanker case. It was because
                            this Government was not represented on the Commission and therefore had
                            no voice in its decisions that the tanker case was submitted to a
                            special tribunal. The Tribunal may have a tendency to lose track of
                            these facts and to follow too closely the decisions of the
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>6. Aside from the question of beneficial ownership: paragraph G of the
                            Agreement, as stated in Department’s L–20, contains ample <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0253"/>provision for award of tankers to
                            Standard Oil Company to extent of its proved interest in German company,
                            with any necessary accounting to the Reparation Commission for any
                            amounts that may have been received by the latter company from the
                            German Government. It must be borne in mind that not only does the
                            Agreement contemplate compensation to the Standard Oil Company for any
                            loss that it might sustain by reason of the transfer of the tankers, but
                            that such compensation shall be made in tankers rather than money. This
                            was insisted upon by the United States in view of the fact that the
                            tankers are necessary to the conduct of the business. It is
                            inconceivable that Tribunal would ignore clear meaning of the Agreement
                            and render a decision which would have the effect of causing financial
                            loss to the American corporation.</p>

                            <item>Referring to Standard Oil tanker arbitration, am confidentially
                                advised that Lyon and Bayne<note n="81" xml:id="d116fn81">Jacques
                                    Lyon and Col. Hugh A. Bayne, members of the independent tribunal
                                    for the Reparation Commission.</note> disagree. Lyon takes the
                                view as to paragraph F of the agreement that a shareholder in a
                                corporation is not the beneficial owner of the corporation’s assets.
                                He supports his view by many precedents, particularly in French
                                jurisprudence, under which the corporation itself was considered the
                                only legal, the only equitable, and the only beneficial owner of its
                                own assets. He emphasizes “beneficial ownership” as distinguished
                                from beneficial interest. Bayne, on the other hand, considering the
                                history of making of the arbitration agreement, holds that the
                                agreement, though expressed obscurely, was endeavoring to convey the
                                idea that if the Standard Oil Company owned all or practically all
                                of the shares in its German subsidiary, then for the purpose of the
                                agreement it was to be considered beneficial owner of the tank
                                steamers. Lyon and Bayne concur that paragraph G of the agreement
                                virtually incorporates by reference the provisions of paragraph 20
                                of annex 2, part VIII of Treaty of Versailles which states that
                                Separation Commission “shall have due regard for any legal or
                                equitable interests of the Allied or Associated Powers.”<note n="82" xml:id="d116fn82">Quotation not paraphrased.</note> They <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0254"/>consider that the
                                commission has shown due regard for these interests by asking
                                Germany to offer compensation therefor so that the ships could be
                                delivered clear and free; and inasmuch as Germany treated the
                                Standard’s German subsidiary exactly the same way as all other
                                German ship companies without regard to nationality of their
                                shareholders and accorded compensation in no way discriminatory but
                                precisely the same as that accorded corporations in which French and
                                English nationals were stockholders, therefore “due regard” does not
                                necessitate an exception and the rendition of tankers themselves in
                                this particular case.</item>

                            <item>The situation resulting from the disagreement of Bayne and Lyon
                                may be handled in one of two ways. First, Dr. Sjoeborg, a Swedish
                                lawyer now in Stockholm, the third arbitrator, can be called in.
                                This of course means additional expense and delay. Secondly, the
                                Standard Oil Company might be willing to suggest as a compromise
                                that it retain half of the tonnage but turn over to or buy from the
                                Reparation Commission the other half. If it retains half and
                                delivers the balance, the company might ask to select its own
                                tonnage.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Personally, I strongly believe that a compromise is advisable
                                because I am afraid that if the case goes to the third arbitrator
                                for decision on its merits, the Standard Oil Company, because of
                                obscure and technical wording of the arbitration agreement, will
                                suffer an [adverse] decision which means that it will have no
                                tonnage. Am confidentially advised that Lyon would be willing to
                                join Bayne in recommending to the Reparation Commission a compromise
                                and the division of the tonnage on half and half basis, and also
                                that Bayne thinks that the third arbitrator, if the case goes to him
                                for opinion, will agree with Lyon that the company is not in law the
                                beneficial owner. I have arranged for sufficient delay to enable the
                                Department to consult Standard Oil Company and decide on suggested
                                compromise before the third arbitrator is called upon. Because of
                                his distance from Paris, he may decline the task which would involve
                                the selection of a new arbitrator. Logan.</item>

                                views, and arguments thereon, during hearings conducted in Paris at
                                which the Standard Oil Company was represented by Mr. Montagu
                                Piesse, its London Solicitor, and the Reparation Commission by Mr.

                            <p>After thorough consideration of the complicated questions of fact and
                                the involved issues of international law raised by the arbitration,
                                the arbitrators regret to report to the Separation Commission that
                                they have failed to agree upon a decision. Pursuant to the literal
                                terms of the action of the Separation Commission just quoted above,
                                it would appear that Dr. S. Sjoeborg, the disinterested person named
                                by the undersigned to serve as a member of the independent Tribunal
                                in the event of such disagreement, who at the time of his
                                designation and acceptance was President of a Section of the Mixed
                                Arbitral Tribunal sitting in Paris, should become a member of the
                                Tribunal and that the decision of the majority of the Tribunal so
                                constituted should be final. Dr. Sjoeborg, however, has terminated
                                his connection with the Mixed Arbitral Tribunal and is now in
                                Stockholm and whether it is still possible for him to serve, or
                                whether another member must be named—with the consequent delay and
                                expense in either event—has not yet been ascertained, and before
                                ascertaining, the present arbitrators desire to present certain
                                observations to the Reparation Commission.</p>
                            <p>During the course of their deliberations they have been impressed by
                                the fact that the close issues of the present arbitration between
                                the parties were such as eminently lent themselves to compromise and
                                friendly adjustment and that such a step, indeed, would perhaps
                                result in a more equitable solution of the problem than an attempt
                                to apply strict, and often conflicting, rules of law to an involved
                                international situation.</p>
                            <p>In this spirit, therefore, without proceeding further with the formal
                                arbitration which for various reasons has already been unduly
                                prolonged, the undersigned desire to suggest that the parties arrive
                                if possible at a compromise, and they suggest that this compromise

                                        These vessels were originally included in the Arbitral
                                        Agreement for disposition in kind but their sale was
                                        authorised by Reparation Commission decision No. 946, as
                                        amended by decision No. 960 (Annex 653), and the net

                                        fund, but should the final approved accounting indicate a
                                        deficit, such deficit would, of course, be a charge against
                                        the value of the eight tank steamers.</item>

                            <p>The division upon an equal basis of the subject matter described in
                                subparagraphs (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) above presents no difficulties, but the equal division
                                of the five tank steamers presents certain complications because of
                                the varying displacement of the individual steamers and because of
                                the fact that it is understood that the value per ton is not
                                uniform. To avoid this involved adjustment, and to arrive at a
                                result which would appear equitable to both parties, the Tribunal
                                ventures to suggest the following procedure which seems to be in
                                conformity with the spirit of the provisions of paragraph [<hi rend="italic">article</hi>] 6 of the Spa Agreement of July 16th,

                            <p>If the United States of America, acting in behalf of its national, is
                                in accord, the Reparation Commission might direct the sale by
                                auction—either upon the British or American market—of the five
                                tankers, it being expressly provided that any of the Allied
                                Governments, or their nationals, or the Reparation Commission might
                                bid for the vessels. It should also be provided that the Deutsche
                                Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft (but no other German national)
                                should be permitted to bid for the tankers.</p>
                            <p>The net proceeds of the sale, after deduction of a deficit in the
                                operating fund (should there be any), might be divided into two
                                parts, one of which would be allocated to the Deutsche Amerikanische
                                Petroleum Gesellschaft providing the German Government was willing
                                to agree that it would claim credit on reparation account for only
                                one-half of the total value of the tankers. The other half of the
                                proceeds of the sale should be retained by the Reparation Commission
                                for the credit of the Power, or Powers, entitled to the tank
                                steamers themselves were they to be allocated in kind. Germany
                                should be credited as of the date of delivery for the then value of
                                one-half the tankers and the Reparation Commission should decide <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0259"/>what value should be
                                debited against the Power, or Powers, receiving one-half of the
                                proceeds above described. The net receipts of the sale of the
                                vessels <hi rend="italic">Mannheim, Helios</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sirius</hi> should be handled both as to debit and
                                credit in a manner similar to that already outlined for the proceeds
                                of the proposed auction. The net operating proceeds, if any, of the
                                five tank vessels hitherto unsold should be allocated in the same
                                way as the proceeds of the sale of those vessels, except that in
                                this instance there would be no question of a credit to Germany for
                                any earnings during the period after their transfer.</p>
                            <p>The undersigned, therefore, before taking further action in the
                                matter of calling upon a third arbitrator, recommend that the
                                Reparation Commission take a decision upon the compromise above
                                outlined, and, should that decision be favourable to the
                                recommendation of the present members of the independent Tribunal,
                                it is further recommended that the decision and this recommendation
                                be communicated to the Unofficial Delegate of the United States of
                                America for transmission to the Standard Oil Company for its
                                acceptance. Should the Standard Oil concur in the recommendation,
                                the details of execution, particularly as regards the adjustment of
                                the operating account, will be a matter for administrative
                                arrangement between the claimant and the Reparation Commission.</p>
                            <p>The present members of the arbitral tribunal hold themselves ready to
                                assist in arranging such details or endeavouring to reconcile any
                                difficulties which may arise in carrying out the compromise
                                settlement which they jointly and earnestly recommend.</p>

                            <item>Since July 8 when the case of the Standard Oil tankers and
                                arbitrators’ report was withdrawn from the agenda of the Reparation
                                Commission upon British delegate’s request, I have at appropriate
                                opportunities sounded out Bradbury on possibility of accepting
                                arbitrators’ recommendation of equal division but he has been
                                reluctant to accede. He keeps stating that he considers arbitration
                                should be proceeded with and that in their recommendation the two
                                    <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0260"/>arbitrators exceeded
                                their functions. He is now awaiting his Government’s instructions.
                                The Department may desire to consider exercising pressure in
                                London.</item>

                            <item>The other delegates seem somewhat indifferent to the subject
                                because the real loser would be Great Britain who would, it is
                                understood, receive the tankers under existing arrangements. The
                                French arbitrator, Lyon, states that he has advised Barthou to vote
                                for compromise. If the issue were forced I do not know how delegates
                                would vote. Please instruct as to whether to accede to continuation
                                of arbitration or to endeavor to force a vote. The outcome of the
                                latter is now uncertain. Logan.</item>

                                there be exercised some sort of pressure in London where the key of
                                the solution of the tanker compromise lies, Wellman suggests that
                                Ambassador Kellogg be advised of his coming and be requested to make
                                a <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> at the appropriate Ministry or at
                                the Foreign Office in the endeavor to get the British Government to
                                instruct Bradbury to vote in the Reparation Commission for the
                                proposed compromise. If he would do so it is almost certain that the
                                compromise would be accepted. I have several times expressed grave
                                doubts lest the Standard Oil receive nothing, if the compromise is
                                not accepted. At least two features should appeal to the British
                                Government from the practical and diplomatic point of view: First,
                                this dispute has been dragging for almost five years and it is not
                                desirable to continue it further, particularly since it is said that
                                the value of the vessels is continually deteriorating. Second,
                                whatever may be the strict law of the case the fact is that American
                                capital was invested in the German corporation and that every ton of
                                the tankers was built directly with funds which Standard Oil Company
                                contributed and for which it [received] bonds of the German
                                corporation. Therefore from the point of view of the business world
                                the <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0261"/>tankers represented
                                [American] money whether or not they flew the German flag. It seems
                                highly inequitable that to pay German reparations an ally should
                                seize what really represents American capital.</item>

                        <p>360. It is probable that Wellman of the Standard Oil Company of New
                            Jersey will call this week to discuss the D. A. P. G. tanker case. These
                            tankers belonged to German subsidiary of which practically all the
                            securities and stock were owned by the Standard Oil Company. In February
                            1917, shortly before the United States entered the war, the company, to
                            prevent seizure of tankers by Germany, endeavored to transfer voting
                            shares valued at 9,000,000 marks to Germans. The American Alien Property
                            Custodian held that the transfer was illegal. The Standard Oil Company
                            retained, however, nonvoting shares valued at 21,000,000 marks and
                            31,000,000 marks of debentures, and even if the transfer of voting stock
                            were legal, Standard’s financial interest in the German company was
                            vastly preponderant. Because of this preponderant interest, the United
                            States, under an agreement of June 7, 1920, with interested Allied
                            Governments and Separation Commission, obtained temporary allocation of
                            tankers pending decision as to their final disposition by a tribunal
                            created under the agreement. Hugh Bayne, American member of the
                            tribunal, and Jacques Lyon, the member appointed by Reparation
                            Commission, have not been able to agree that the stockholders as
                            beneficial owners are entitled to property of a corporation. They have
                            agreed, however, to a compromise which they submitted to the Reparation
                            Commission on June 28, last. The Standard Oil Company has informally
                            accepted this compromise which the members of the tribunal considered
                            would perhaps result in a more equitable solution of the problem than an
                            attempt to apply strict, and often conflicting, rules of law to an
                            involved international situation. Briefly, it envisages a 50–50 division
                            between the company and the Reparation Commission of the proceeds of the
                            sale of the tankers and their earnings. Logan advised that Bradbury was
                            disposed to raise technical objections against approval of the proposed
                            compromise by the Reparation <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0262"/>Commission and had consulted his Government. He now reports receipt of
                            a letter of October 9 from the British delegation stating that they have
                            decided not to accept the compromise and that they believe that the
                            referee should be called in as originally arranged. The Department
                            considers that while possibly technically the two members of the
                            tribunal had no authorization to make such a recommendation and the case
                            should have been referred to the umpire for determination in the event
                            of a disagreement between them, nevertheless a settlement of the nature
                            they indicate appears clearly to come within the scope of the Tanker
                            Agreement, and particularly within the spirit of paragraph G, which
                            contemplates that the Standard Oil be paid compensation, even if it did
                            not establish beneficial ownership, and even if, as is the case, Germany
                            had paid some compensation to the German subsidiary. Logan has been
                            instructed to send you a brief statement of the status of the case, also
                            copies of documents mentioned above and Department’s L–20 of December
                                12<note n="88" xml:id="d121fn88"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_213"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 213</ref>.</note> and L–39 of
                            January 12, last. After consulting these documents and after
                            consultation with Wellman, you may, at his request, urge that the
                            British Government reconsider, with a view to instructing its delegation
                            on the Reparation Commission to approve the proposed compromise. In view
                            of the obvious equities in the case and the undisputed preponderant
                            financial interest of Standard Oil Company in the tankers, Department
                            considers that Reparation Commission would be warranted in accepting the
                            compromise proposed, thereby obviating necessity of referring case to
                            the umpire for decision.</p>

                        <p>432. Referring to Department’s 360, October 14, have studied documents
                            supplied by Logan and have consulted Wellman. Because of absence of
                            Prime Minister and indisposition of Sir Eyre Crowe, the Foreign Office
                            suggested that I consult Niemeyer in the Treasury. I presented the case
                            fully to him and stated that both my Government and Standard Oil Company
                            would accept the compromise suggested by arbitrators.</p>
                        <p>He stated his firm belief that as a matter of principle the agreed
                            arbitration ought to be completed. Although there was further <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0263"/>discussion, there was no change
                            of position. He agreed finally to discuss the case within the next few
                            days with Sir John Bradbury, but I incline to the belief that both have
                            their minds made up. Have informed Logan.</p>

                        <p>398. Your telegram 432, October 21. The Department did not expect
                            favorable action from Bradbury as it understands he is inclined to raise
                            technical objections. You may consider it advisable to bring the matter
                            to the attention of the Foreign Office shortly after the new government
                            is formed.</p>
                        <p>Even if the attempted transfer of voting stock in the D.A.P.G. by the
                            Standard Oil Company could be considered valid, it still owned
                            securities of the subsidiary totaling nearly five times the value of the
                            voting shares. Included in the securities it held were share warrants to
                            over twice the number and value of the voting shares which were of
                            exactly the same nature as the latter, except that they carried no
                            voting right. Obviously, this voting right has no bearing upon the
                            equitable or beneficial interest of the stockholder. The Department
                            considers that the compromise suggested by the arbitrators is more than
                            fair to the Reparation Commission and the interested Allied States, in
                            view of this undisputed preponderant financial interest. It is believed
                            that if the matter were referred to the umpire the Standard Oil might
                            well expect to obtain a greater portion. In view of the equities in the
                            case and because a settlement of the nature indicated appears clearly to
                            come within the scope of the Tanker Agreement, and practically within
                            the spirit of paragraph G, as indicated in Department’s 360 of October
                            14, the Department is of the opinion that you may be able to persuade
                            the British Foreign Office to instruct the British representative on the
                            Reparation Commission to approve of the compromise. This would obviate
                            the delay and expense incident to the reference of the case to the
                            umpire for decision.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is to be read in connection with Department’s 368 of
                            October 21.<note n="89" xml:id="d123fn89">Not printed.</note> Take no

                            Secretary of the Navy that the rigid airship <hi rend="italic">ZR–3</hi>, now building in Friedrichshafen, Germany, for the Government
                            of the United States, will fly to Lake-hurst, New Jersey, sometime
                            between the fifteenth of November and the first of December, 1923. The
                            probable route of the ship will be from Friedrichshafen across France to
                            the Bay of Biscay, thence across Cape Finisterre, the Azores and
                            possibly the Bermuda Islands. It appears that the route cannot be
                            absolutely determined at this time, however, and it is possible that the
                            airship may fly over The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, France,
                            Spain, Portugal and Great Britain before crossing the Atlantic

                            regard, that, in order to secure the desired permission, the following
                            information must be given: the place at which the airship will enter
                            Spain; the object of the voyage; the place where the airship will desire
                            to land; the time that it will remain in Spanish territory; the place at
                            which the airship will leave Spanish territory to return to the United
                            States; the name of the pilot of the airship; its cargo, with details as

                            states that Zeppelin is expected to start transatlantic flight on or
                            about September 25 and that route will probably be over some part of
                            France, Belgium, Holland, England and the Occupied Territory of Germany.

                        <p>You will approach Foreign Office and request definitive authority for

                            of flight will be “on or about September 25” will satisfy British
                            requirements as to insertion of appropriate dates in authorization

                            about to sail for America in the near future, possibly next week.
                            Authorizations for the flight of this airship over their territories
                            have been granted by the Governments of Great Britain (including
                            Northern Ireland), the Irish Free State, Bermuda, France, Belgium and
                            Holland.</p>
                        <p>It is not intended that in her transatlantic flight the <hi rend="italic">ZR–3</hi> shall pass over the territory of Canada or Newfoundland
                            and such territory will only be flown over in the event of stress of
                            weather or other unforeseen circumstances. I trust that if such a
                            contingency should arise the Governments of Canada and Newfoundland
                            would extend to the <hi rend="italic">ZR–3</hi> and her occupants the
                            kind reception usually accorded mariners in distress, and I should be
                            greatly obliged if you would confirm this assumption.</p>

                        <p>The possible objection you mention to the Zeppelin flying the German flag
                            seems unreasonable to the Department, but if the Foreign Office is
                            insistent upon it, you are instructed to risk no further delay by
                            insisting on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the duration trial flight is just now in
                            process of completion and therefore the transatlantic flight may be
                            possible at any day; accordingly, Department requests you to secure and

                        <p>115. Your 200, October 2, 4 p.m. Although Zeppelin contract provides
                            specifically for acceptance of airship by this Government only upon
                            delivery in this country, nevertheless, it was this Government which
                            secured permission for its construction and it is for this Government
                            that it is being built. Authorization for flight of Zeppelin over
                            foreign territories to United States is necessary consequence of
                            permission for construction, and accordingly the United States has
                            approached the governments whose territory may be traversed. The
                            necessary authorizations have been obtained and no action by the German
                            Government appears necessary in the premises. You will <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0276"/>immediately inform Foreign Office of
                            substance of foregoing in correction of verbal opinion expressed by
                            you.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] The French Government has attached to the permission
                            granted for crossing its territory the condition that the Zeppelin shall
                            not fly the German flag while in transit over French territory.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s understanding that the representatives of the Navy
                            Department at Friedrichshafen have attended to this matter and that
                            German flag will not be flown over French territory. Any attempt by
                            German authorities to raise the question of authorization in general or
                            of German flag in particular would be most unfortunate. [End

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Senator Lodge</hi>: I understand that
                            questions have been raised with respect to certain clauses in the treaty
                            with Germany now pending before your Committee. In view of the
                            importance of these clauses, I desire to emphasize the considerations
                            which led to their inclusion in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary for me to refer to the general situation with
                            respect to our commercial treaties. With a number of countries we have
                            no commercial treaties, and the treaties we have should be supplemented
                            and brought up to date. Important subjects are not covered and as to
                            other subjects more precise and definite provisions are required. We are
                            therefore faced with the necessity of negotiating commercial treaties
                            which should be responsive to our needs, and to this end there has been
                            a most careful study of the questions presented. In this examination we
                            have been led to consider the fundamental policies which our commercial
                            treaties should embody. The result of this examination appears in the
                            pending treaty with Germany.</p>
                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0278"/>
                        <p>I understand that the difficulties, which your Committee has met, relate
                            to two classes of provisions,—(1) those providing for “national”
                            treatment, and (2) those providing for “most-favored-nation”
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">First. National treatment</hi>. These provisions give
                            to the nationals of the contracting Powers reciprocally the same
                            privileges which the contracting Powers respectively accord to their own
                            nationals in relation to the subject described. Thus the pending treaty
                            with Germany provides in Article VII as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Similar provisions for reciprocal national treatment are found in our

                            Spain; and of 1911 with Japan.</p>
                        <p>It is manifest that to refuse to provide for such reciprocal national
                            treatment in the negotiation of our new commercial treaties would be a
                            clear departure from our policy embodied in these existing treaties.
                            Further, there is no provision in many of these existing treaties for
                            the abrogation of the provisions in question without abrogating the
                            whole treaty. Some of our treaties, as those with Great Britain and the
                            Argentine Republic, have no provision for termination and, assuming that
                            they could be terminated on reasonable notice, they could be terminated
                            in this way only as a whole and not in part. It would, however, be a
                            serious thing for us to dispose of all our commercial treaties without
                            negotiating new treaties to take their place. If we were to abrogate
                            existing treaties before undertaking such negotiations we should be in
                            an unfortunate situation, and, if we were to undertake to negotiate
                            substitute treaties without such abrogation, we should not be likely to
                            get terms more favorable to the United States than the terms of the
                            existing treaties unless we paid for them with substantial
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if we continue to be bound by the provisions for
                            national treatment in the existing treaties, there would seem to be
                            little in the point that we should reserve in relation to other
                            countries rights of discrimination by refusing national treatment. This
                            would practically be a threat of discrimination against certain
                            countries, inviting reprisals, while at the same time our hands would be
                            tied in carrying out a similar policy as to the countries with which we
                            have treaties of the sort above described.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these considerations the policy of giving reciprocal national
                            treatment as embodied in existing treaties so far as they go, and as
                            denned in the clauses in the pending treaty with Germany, is believed to
                            be a sound one.</p>
                        <p>Take, for example, the case of a tonnage duty. This is imposed upon a
                            vessel entering a port and is measured according to the net registered
                            tonnage of the vessel. It is a duty on the ship as such, and is the
                            price exacted by the territorial sovereign for the privilege given the
                            vessel to enter with its cargo. It becomes of the highest importance to
                            the shipowner, foreign or domestic, that his vessel be not subjected to
                            a heavier tax than that imposed upon rival vessels under any flag. The
                            rivals of an American vessel entering, for example, a European port
                            called <hi rend="italic">X</hi>, are not merely the vessels of third
                            States but the vessels of <hi rend="italic">X</hi> itself. Thus, in
                            entering into a <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0281"/>treaty
                            providing for tonnage duties, the problem is not to secure such benefits
                            as the other contracting party may yield to third States, but rather to
                            safeguard one contracting State (such as the United States in its
                            treaty) against special concessions or discriminations which the other
                            contracting State might otherwise make in favor of its own vessels. The
                            manifest reason for this policy is that the ships of each contracting
                            party are competitors of the ships of the other. This fact has led to
                            the practice of the United States, evidenced by the treaties above
                            described, in providing for reciprocal national treatment of tonnage
                            duties in treaties with maritime States. This has the sanction of our
                            statutory law in relation to tonnage duties. (U. S. Rev. Stat. sec.
                            4219; Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121, sec. 14, 23 Stat. 57; June 19, 1886,
                            c. 421, sec. 11, 24 Stat. 81; April 4, 1888, c. 61, sec. 1, 25 Stat. 80;
                            August 5, 1909, c. 6, sec. 36, 36 Stat. 111.)</p>
                        <p>If the United States is to have its proper place as a maritime Power and
                            its vessels are to enter the ports of the world, it must insist upon
                            freedom from discriminations in such ports by the respective sovereigns
                            in relation to their own vessels. How is the United States to obtain
                            such freedom from discrimination? It is said that it may retaliate, but,
                            in this sense, retaliation is only a means to an end, and the end is to
                            obtain the desired freedom from discrimination. The way to assure this
                            freedom is by agreement and, of course, what the United States asks it
                            must give. Thus we have, as a natural result, the historic provisions of
                            our commercial treaties with respect to reciprocal national treatment.
                            Provisions of this type have become common to and appear in the treaties
                            of practically all nations.</p>
                        <p>Again, a cargo duty represents the effort of a State to exact a charge by
                            reason of the carriage of a cargo of a vessel under a particular flag. A
                            State doubtless may, in the absence of a treaty, impose cargo duties
                            that discriminate in its own favor by exacting a heavier charge on
                            cargoes carried in foreign bottoms than on those carried in its own
                            ships. Here again it appears, as in the case of tonnage duties, that a
                            maritime State about to contract with another finds its competitor in
                            the State with which it deals and must be on its guard lest that State
                            be left free to discriminate in favor of its own shipping through
                            impositions of cargo duties which place a heavier burden on cargoes
                            carried in foreign vessels than on those carried in its own. This danger
                            has led to the practice of the United States in incorporating in its
                            treaties provisions for reciprocal national treatment of cargo duties.
                            This policy is supported by the provisions aimed at securing protection
                            from discrimination which are found in Article 317 of the Tariff Act of
                                1922.<note n="11" xml:id="d155fn11">42 Stat. 858, 944.</note> In
                            this <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0282"/>case, as in the case of
                            tonnage duties, the object is attained when another State is willing to
                            agree not to impose discriminatory exactions upon our commerce and this,
                            of course, calls for similar agreement upon our part. Either we are to
                            have a policy of discriminations or a policy of obtaining immunity from
                            discriminations. If the latter policy is adopted, then we achieve our
                            purpose in securing agreements by which States will not discriminate
                            against us.</p>
                        <p>I should hardly think it necessary to argue the question whether a policy
                            of discriminations, as an end in itself, would be in our interest, for
                            our history would seem sufficiently to show that it would not.
                            Discrimination in favor of our own vessels will certainly produce
                            retaliation by foreign States whose tonnage is adversely affected by the
                            American discriminatory action. If we impose discriminatory tonnage or
                            cargo duties, they will be imposed by foreign Powers against our
                            vessels. The effect of such retaliatory measures would probably be that
                            if American ships coming from abroad entered American ports with full
                            cargoes they would go back empty. Any attempt by Congress to alleviate
                            the situation by lessening charges for transportation could be met by
                            like action on the part of the foreign State to which exports from the
                            United States were destined. A policy of discrimination and retaliation,
                            as an end in itself, would be a policy fatal to our interest, not only
                            in the highest degree embarrassing so far as our shipping interests are
                            concerned, but having by-products in resentment and ill-will and in the
                            encouragement of other efforts to cripple our trade which would make us
                            pay dearly for our experiment. A policy of discrimination and
                            retaliation, not as an end in itself, but merely to enforce proper
                            regard for our own interests by freeing us from discriminations abroad
                            would find its aim achieved in agreements such as the pending treaty
                            with Germany and other treaties of like import, under which
                            discriminations would be impossible.</p>
                        <p>That a policy of discrimination if entered upon by this Government in
                            favor of national shipping would certainly be met by retaliation is a
                            conclusion fortified by recent events. The British Imperial Conference
                            which recently met in London is understood to have adopted the following
                            Resolution: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            approved by the Second General Conference on Communications and Transit
                            at Geneva in December, 1923, contained the following provision in the
                            first paragraph of Article VIII: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Each of the Contracting States reserves the power, after giving

                                    sovereignty or authority, the provisions of this Statute to the
                                    vessels of the said Contracting State, their cargoes and

                        <p>It may be observed that Article II of the same Statute contemplates
                            reciprocal national treatment of vessels in the following terms: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    the port, the use of the port, and the full enjoyment of the

                        <p>The abandonment of reciprocal national treatment with the design of
                            permitting discriminatory tonnage and cargo duties favorable to American
                            shipping would mark the beginning of a bitter strife in which reprisal
                            would follow reprisal and the very interests sought to be benefited
                            would be jeopardized. To seek such a war as an end in itself would seem
                            to be a desperate recourse. It is believed that American shipping will
                            prosper far more greatly by a policy which ensures for it through
                            appropriate international agreements immunity from unjust
                            discriminations.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Second. Most-favored-nation treatment</hi>. I suppose
                            that no one would object to the inclusion of the usual
                            most-favored-nation provisions in our commercial treaties. I take it for
                            granted that we desire to obtain in our treaties the same benefits for
                            the United States that the other contracting Powers give to third
                            States. The <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0284"/>question which has
                            arisen, with respect to the most-favored-nation clauses in the pending
                            Treaty with Germany grows out of the fact that these clauses provide
                            reciprocally for most-favored-nation treatment without regard to the
                            question whether a favored third State shall have been accorded the
                            favor gratuitously or in return for special compensation. In other
                            words, the pending Treaty applies what is termed the “unconditional”
                            most-favored-nation principle. This is indeed a departure from our
                            former practice but it is believed to be a wise departure.</p>
                        <p>The traditional policy of the United States in respect to
                            most-favored-nation treatment was developed on the theory that
                            privileges and concessions in the field of duties on imports or exports
                            should be granted only in return for privileges and concessions
                            reciprocally accorded. Thus there was almost uniformly written into the
                            treaties to which we became a party the provision that
                            most-favored-nation treatment should be conditional: The benefit of
                            concessions or reductions of duties made to third States by either
                            contracting Power should accrue to the other contracting Power freely,
                            if freely made to the third State, but only in return for an equivalent
                            if made to the third State for a reciprocal concession or reduction.</p>
                        <p>In practice, the application of the principle of granting special
                            concessions in return for special concessions involved the upsetting of
                            the equilibrium of conditions which it was in the interest of this
                            country to maintain. It was the interest and fundamental aim of this
                            country to secure equality of treatment but the conditional
                            most-favored-nation clause was not in fact productive of equality of
                            treatment and could not guarantee it. It merely promised an opportunity
                            to bargain for such treatment. Moreover, the ascertaining of what might
                            constitute equivalent compensation in the application of the conditional
                            most-favored-nation principle was found to be difficult or
                            impracticable. Reciprocal commercial arrangements were but temporary
                            makeshifts; they caused constant negotiation and created uncertainty.
                            Under present conditions, the expanding foreign commerce of the United
                            States needs a guarantee of equality of treatment which cannot be
                            furnished by the conditional form of the most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>While we were persevering in the following of the policy of conditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment, the leading commercial countries of
                            Europe, and in fact most of the countries of the world, adopted and
                            pursued the policy of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment: Each
                            concession which one country made to another became generalized in favor
                            of all countries to which the country making the concession was
                            obligated by treaty to extend most-favored-nation treatment. As the
                            United States attained to a position of first rank as a World Power, we,
                            in defence of our essential interests, <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0285"/>became an active champion, in fact the foremost
                            champion of the principle of the “open door” in the field of
                            international commercial relations. To be consistent with our
                            professions, and to conserve our interests it has become important that
                            we make our commercial practice square in fact with the theory upon
                            which our policy has been based. This explains the reason why, having
                            examined with most minute care the history of the application of our
                            conditional most-favored-nation principle, the Administration decided to
                            abandon this practice and in its place to adopt the practice of
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. After the matter had been
                            presented to President Harding he wrote me as follows, on February 27,
                            1923: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I am well convinced that the adoption of [the] unconditional
                                    favored nation policy is the simpler way to maintain our tariff
                                    policy in accordance with the recently enacted law and is
                                    probably the surer way of effectively extending our trade
                                    abroad. If you are strongly of this opinion, you may proceed
                                    with your negotiations upon the unconditional policy.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Tariff Act of 1922 contains provisions which differentiated it from
                            previous tariff legislation. Articles 315, 316 and 317 show that
                            Congress realized that we had entered upon a new era, calling for new
                            methods and a new attitude. The time has come for demanding that
                            conditions of commercial competition be placed upon a basis which will
                            both assure our own interests and contribute to the peace of the world
                            by eliminating unnecessary economic contentions. As we seek pledges from
                            other foreign countries that they will refrain from practicing
                            discrimination, we must be ready to give such pledges, and history has
                            shown that these pledges can be made adequate only in terms of
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. We should seek simplicity
                            and good will as the fundamental conditions of international
                            commerce.</p>
                        <p>There is one apparent misapprehension which I should like to remove. It
                            may be argued that by the most-favored-nation clauses in the pending
                            treaty with Germany we would automatically extend privileges given to
                            Germany to other Powers without obtaining the advantages which the
                            treaty with Germany gives to us. This is a mistake. We give to Germany
                            explicitly the unconditional most-favored-nation treatment which she
                            gives to us. We do not give unconditional most-favored-nation treatment
                            to other Powers unless they are willing to make with us the same treaty,
                            in substance, that Germany has made. Most-favored-nation treatment would
                            be given to other Powers only by virtue of our treaties with them, and
                            these treaties, so far as we have them, do not embrace unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment. We cannot make treaties with all the <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0286"/>Powers at the same moment, but
                            if the Senate approves the treaty which we have made with Germany we
                            shall endeavor to negotiate similar treaties with other Powers and such
                            other Powers will not obtain unconditional most-favored-nation treatment
                            unless they conclude with us treaties similar to the one with
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>In the same line I may observe, recurring to what I have said above with
                            regard to national treatment of shipping, that the provisions of the
                            treaty with Germany for such national treatment will not accrue to the
                            benefit of other Powers with whom we do not make, or have not made, a
                            treaty similar to the treaty with Germany and I may repeat that our
                            existing commercial treaties contain provisions, so far as they go, for
                            national treatment of shipping.</p>
                        <p>In short, if the treaty with Germany is approved, we shall be in a
                            position to conclude negotiations with other Powers upon the same basis
                            and in this way most effectively to remove whatever discriminations may
                            now exist to the prejudice of the United States.</p>

                                    believing it to be desirable in the interest of uniformity to
                                    incorporate in the treaties proposed for negotiation between
                                    Great Britain and the United States substantially the same
                                    preambles as those incorporated in the other treaties mentioned
                                    above.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States adheres to the position it
                                    has heretofore taken, namely, that the right to dispose of the
                                    overseas possessions of Germany was acquired only through the
                                    victory of the Allied and Associated Powers, and that there can
                                    be no valid or effective disposition of these territories
                                    without the assent of the United States as one of the
                                    participants in that victory. This position of the United States
                                    is not opposed, but is confirmed, by the Treaty of
                                        Versailles,<note n="7" xml:id="d156fn7">Malloy, <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>, 1910–1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>, p. 3329.</note> by which
                                    Germany renounces in favor of the Principal Allied and
                                    Associated Powers, of which the United States was one, all her
                                    rights and titles over her overseas possessions. It <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0288"/>may further be observed that in
                                    providing (Article 440) that the Treaty when ratified by Germany
                                    and three of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers should
                                    come into force between the ratifying Powers, it was manifestly
                                    not the intention that on such ratification by three Powers
                                    there should still remain in Germany any undivided share of
                                    right, title or sovereignty in the overseas possessions
                                    described. It would seem to be clear that the renunciation set
                                    forth in Article 119 of the Treaty was not intended to be
                                    divisible. In consequence, had the Treaty come into force on the
                                    ratification by only three of the Principal Allied and
                                    Associated Powers, the renunciation would still have been
                                    completely effective, disposing of the entire interest of
                                    Germany, and Article 119 would necessarily have thus become
                                    effective according to its express terms, that is, in favor of
                                    the five Principal Allied and Associated Powers and not
                                    otherwise. The three ratifying Powders could have claimed no
                                    greater right or title than the Treaty gave and no exclusive
                                    right or title which the Treaty by its terms did not confer.
                                    There was the same result on the actual ratification of the
                                    Treaty and the failure of the United States to ratify did not
                                    qualify the terms of Germany’s renunciation. Any different terms
                                    would necessarily require the agreement of the parties
                                    concerned, including Germany herself, and no such agreement was
                                    made. Subsequently, it may be added, Germany by her treaty with
                                    the United States<note n="8" xml:id="d156fn8"><ref target="frus1921v02#pg_29"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                                Relations</hi>, 1921, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 29</ref>.</note> confirmed to the
                                    United States the rights and benefits accruing to it under
                                    Article 119 of the Treaty of Versailles. Thus, it must be
                                    insisted that both by virtue of the participation of the United
                                    States in the common victory and by the explicit terms of
                                    Germany’s renunciation of her overseas possessions, no valid
                                    disposition of the territories in question can be made without
                                    the consent of the United States, and, as has already been
                                    pointed out, this consent can only be granted through a duly
                                    negotiated treaty ratified with the advice and consent of the
                                    Senate of the United States. The Government of the United States
                                    cannot depart from this fundamental position and consequently is
                                    unable to admit that four of the five Principal Allied and
                                    Associated Powers can accord to themselves or to others any
                                    privileged position or any advantages not equally accorded to
                                    the United States in the former German overseas possessions
                                    title and right to which, as a result of the common victory,
                                    were renounced by Germany in favor of the five Principal Allied
                                    and Associated Powers.</p>
                                <p>Although, as stated above, the Government of the United States
                                    believes that it would be desirable in the interest of
                                    uniformity if the preambles of the treaties which it is
                                    negotiating with His Majesty’s Government could follow
                                    substantially the form of the preambles accepted by the
                                    Governments of Belgium, France and Japan in the treaties
                                    concluded between those countries and the United States,
                                    nevertheless, the Government of the United States, while it
                                    maintains unqualifiedly the position it has taken with regard to
                                    its rights in mandated territories, is not disposed to insist
                                    unduly upon the mere form of the preambles heretofore suggested
                                    for incorporation in the pending treaties with Great Britain.

                                    preamble which, it is hoped, satisfactorily meets the objections

                        <p>180. Your 99, April 15, 2 p.m. I have received a note from the Foreign
                            Office of which the following are the pertinent portions: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The information now received from Sir Herbert Samuel<note n="18" xml:id="d161fn18">British High Commissioner for
                                        Palestine.</note> is to the following effect: Israel
                                    Hanovich, who resides at Telaviv, was convicted in his absence
                                    by a magistrate of contravening the town planning law and
                                    sentenced to a fine. In default of payment, the accused was
                                    imprisoned. Hanovich did not appear before the court to lodge
                                    opposition and did not appeal after judgment had been notified
                                    to him, nor did he ever raise the plea of United States
                                    citizenship. Subsequently, however, representations were
                                    received by the attorney general of the Palestine Administration
                                    from the United States consul, whereupon the attorney general
                                    informed the United States consul of the facts of the case and
                                    Israel Hanovich was immediately released.”</p>

                            receiving the information from the Embassy that it is the intention of

                        <p>315. The American Consul at Jerusalem, under date of August 19, 1924,
                            telegraphed the Department “New customs duties amendment ordinance
                            increasing considerably rate on imported articles published August 15th,
                            and duty collected under new schedule from August 18th”.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, this Government has consistently taken the position
                            that pending the final determination of the status of the territories
                            detached from the Ottoman Empire, and in the absence of the assent of
                            the interested Powers to the suspension or modification of the rights
                            derived from the capitulations, the authorities administering
                            territories detached from the Ottoman Empire are bound by the
                            obligations incident to the existence of the capitulatory regime. By
                            virtue of the capitulations American citizens in Palestine are entitled
                            to exemption from all taxes except such as are approved by this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>You should call the foregoing to the attention of the British Government
                            and say that this Government would be pleased to receive an expression
                            of the views of the British Government with respect to the situation in
                            Palestine which has arisen as a result of the reported attempt to
                            collect from American citizens an increased customs duty to which the
                            assent of this Government had not been previously requested.</p>
                        <p>You may likewise inform the British Government that the Department has
                            forwarded to you by mail a note to be communicated <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0295"/>to the British Government assenting,

                        <p>365. American Consul Jerusalem reports that Messrs. Berlin and Pacowsky,
                            Russian nationals who have opted for Palestinian nationality have
                            brought suit against Philip Skora an American in the Magistrate’s Court
                            at Tel-Aviv, which has seized the bank account of Skora for a sufficient
                            sum to meet the judgment. Consul protested to the Chief Secretary of the
                            Government of Palestine who replied that the Palestinian Government had
                            no power by administrative order to remove the attachment. The judgment
                            in this case was handed down by a local court in disregard of the rights
                            of the American Consular Court.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires you to bring this case to the attention of the
                            Foreign Office and call attention to the position of this Government
                            that, pending conclusion of the proposed agreement between Great Britain
                            and the United States, with reference to Palestine, the capitulatory
                            rights of the United States persist. This Government trusts that
                            appropriate instructions in this matter will be issued to the officials
                            in Palestine.</p>

                        <p>516. The Foreign Office inquires whether in view of the signature of the
                            Palestine mandate convention you now desire to pursue the questions
                            raised concerning increased customs duty in Palestine and the attachment
                            of the bank account of Skora; see your telegrams 315, September 2, 4
                            p.m. and 365, October 18, 2 p.m. The Foreign Office suggests that
                            although the points raised are still under consideration by His
                            Majesty’s Government, their importance is no longer such as to warrant
                            continuance of the correspondence.</p>

                                assent to any dues or taxes to be imposed upon Americans in
                                Palestine prior to the coming into effect of the Mandate Convention
                                has not been changed by the signature of that convention. Meanwhile
                                the Department would, however, be disposed to give favorable
                                consideration to any reasonable request of the Mandatory Power that
                                the United States assent to the collection of increased dues or
                                taxes from Americans in Palestine as from the date of the
                                communication of its assent to the British Government. A similar
                                procedure was followed with respect to a contemplated increase of
                                customs dues in Syria shortly after signature of the Syrian mandate

                                involving the exercise of judicial functions by American Consuls.
                                This Government relies upon the Mandatory Power to take appropriate
                                measures to the end that judgments rendered against American <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0297"/>citizens by Palestinian

                                    suggested that the early conclusion of a convention for the
                                    recognition of the British Mandate over Palestine would provide
                                    the most satisfactory solution of the difficulties in
                                    question.</p>
                                <p>Under instructions, I take pleasure in informing you that my
                                    Government concurs in the desirability of an early conclusion of

                                    convention recently signed with the Government of France
                                    relating to the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon<note n="30" xml:id="d170fn30"><ref target="frus1924v02#pg_741">Vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 741</ref>.</note> and

                                    convention.</p>
                                <p>In view of the fact that the subject matter to be dealt with in
                                    the case of the Palestine Convention is similar to that involved
                                    in the negotiations in the case of the Syrian Mandate, there
                                    would appear to be obvious advantages in preparing conventions
                                    in the two cases as nearly alike as possible.</p>

                                    1922, to which reference was made in Lord Curzon’s communication
                                    of November 29, 1923. The convention recently concluded with
                                    France with respect to Syria and the Lebanon follows on
                                    essential points the proposals which were considered in July
                                    1922 and taking this convention as a basis for negotiation,
                                    would not involve any material divergence from the earlier
                                    proposals.</p>
                                <p>With respect to the preamble to the Convention, I am instructed
                                    to express the hope of my Government that objection will not be
                                    raised to the formula which has already been adopted in the case
                                    of the convention relating to Syria and the Lebanon. If this
                                    result would be facilitated by my Government’s concurrence in
                                    incorporating not only the text of the Mandate but also the
                                    Preamble to the Mandate in the Preamble to the Convention, my
                                    Government is prepared to accept this modification.</p>
                                <p>As your Excellency will note, my Government suggested to the
                                    French Government the inclusion in the Convention with respect
                                    to Syria of a provision extending to Syria and the Lebanon the
                                    provisions of the existing Extradition and Consular Treaties and
                                    Conventions between France and the United States. For reasons
                                    which appear in the annexed correspondence, the French
                                    Government, while quite willing to extend to the United States
                                    the privileges of these treaties, preferred to effect this by an
                                    exchange of notes rather than by the addition of an Article in
                                    the Convention itself. It is suggested that in the Palestine
                                    Convention express provision be made for the application to
                                    Palestine of the extradition treaties in force between the two
                                    countries along the lines proposed in the British draft of
                                    October 2, 1922. The first paragraph of Article VI of the draft
                                    convention contains an appropriate provision to this effect.</p>
                                <p>With regard to the privileges and immunities of Consuls in the
                                    mandated territory, your attention is directed to the assurances
                                    in this respect which have been given by the French Government
                                    in its correspondence with regard to Syria and the Lebanon.
                                    Under the capitulatory regime in Palestine the position of
                                    Consular Officers and the prerogatives of their offices were
                                    safeguarded. As it is contemplated that, in view of the terms of
                                    the mandate, capitulatory rights should be suspended, it will be
                                    particularly important to my Government that the British
                                    Government give assurances that American Consular Officers in
                                    the mandated territory would enjoy all the immunities and
                                    privileges accorded by international law and custom or as may be
                                    granted to the consuls of any other power by treaty or
                                    otherwise. In view of the insufficiency of the existing treaty
                                    provisions with Great Britain relating to consular rights, a
                                    stipulation to this effect as well as for the application to the
                                    mandated territory of the provisions of any treaties in <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0299"/>force between the two
                                    countries which relate to consular rights, is contained in the
                                    proposed Article VI.</p>
                                <p>The text of Article VI which my Government proposes would read as
                                    follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                        <p>‘The extradition treaties and conventions in force

                                <p>Your Excellency will note that the eight articles of the
                                    convention of which I enclose a draft are substantially those
                                    proposed in the British Foreign Office draft of October 2, 1922,
                                    with the exception of the article given above and article V,

                                    territory. It is hoped that the British Government will not
                                    raise objection to the provisions of Article V which have
                                    already been accepted by the French Government with regard to

                                    25 of the Palestine Mandate which indicated that the Council of
                                    the League of Nations had approved a memorandum submitted by the
                                    British representative outlining the provisions of the mandate
                                    for Palestine which are not to be applicable to the territory
                                    known as Trans Jordan as therein defined. In this memorandum it
                                    is stated that His Majesty’s Government accept full
                                    responsibility as mandatory for Transjordan and that such
                                    provision as may be made for the administration of that
                                    territory, in accordance with Article 25 of the mandate, shall
                                    be in no way inconsistent with those provisions of the mandate
                                    which are not, by the resolution, declared inapplicable.</p>
                                <p>Upon the conclusion of the convention between the United States
                                    and Great Britain with respect to Palestine it is my
                                    Government’s understanding that the convention will be
                                    applicable to such territory as may be under British mandate to
                                    the east as well as to the west of the River Jordan and that in
                                    view of the provisions of Article VII as proposed no further
                                    change would be made with respect to the conditions of the
                                    British administration of the territory known as Trans Jordan
                                    without the previous assent of my Government. I am instructed to
                                    inquire whether the British Government is in accord with this

                                    communication of the British Government to the Italian
                                    Government outlining the privileges which the British Government
                                    indicated its willingness to extend to Italy in respect of
                                    Palestine. You will note in the enclosures hereto annexed the
                                    views which my Government has expressed to the <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0300"/>French Government with respect
                                    to the somewhat similar assurances given to Italy by France with
                                    respect to Syria. It will also be noted that the French
                                    Government has undertaken in this correspondence to assure to my
                                    Government most-favored-nation treatment with respect to the
                                    agreement between France and Italy and any other agreements
                                    relating to Syria and the Lebanon which may be entered into by
                                    France with any other government. In concluding an agreement
                                    with respect to Palestine, my Government trusts that the British
                                    Government will be prepared likewise to give in an exchange of
                                    notes the assurance of most-favored-nation treatment with
                                    respect to the arrangement reached by Great Britain with Italy
                                    or any other agreements relating to Palestine which have been or
                                    may in the future be reached affecting the Mandated territory.”

                        <p>Department understands that Embassy Paris has communicated this
                            correspondence to you and Department has already received French Foreign
                            Office’s consent to bringing the correspondence to attention of British
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the statement in the concluding paragraph of the note
                            quoted above as to the assurances desired by this Government in the case
                            of Palestine, it is believed that reference to the note itself and to
                            the correspondence with the French Government with respect to the Syrian
                            Mandate will sufficiently indicate the nature of the assurances which
                            the Department desires. The two situations are quite similar, as the
                            undertakings which Great Britain has given to Italy with respect to
                            Palestine are similar to those given by France to Italy with respect to
                            Syria.</p>
                        <p>In the negotiations with the French Government it was found convenient to
                            agree, prior to formal communication, upon the text of notes to be
                            exchanged at the time of the signature of the convention, and in case
                            the British Foreign Office is agreeable to this procedure, and would be
                            willing to submit in draft form a communication embodying the assurances
                            they are prepared to give, the Department will also communicate a draft
                            reply. If agreement can be reached upon the text of the Mandate
                            Convention and upon the two communications <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0301"/>to be exchanged, it will be possible to proceed to the

                        <p>This draft convention as above described is, as you will note, similar to

                                have given their attentive and sympathetic consideration to the
                                draft convention respecting the British Mandate in Palestine
                                enclosed in Your Excellency’s note No. 187 of the 30th of

                                accept, subject to certain minor textual amendments, the United

                                the second half of article 6, dealing with the privileges to be
                                accorded to United States consular officers in Palestine. His
                                Majesty’s Government regret that they do not see the necessity for
                                the insertion in the convention of any such stipulation as that
                                proposed, since the Palestine Administration have every intention of
                                treating United States consular officers in as favorable a manner as
                                the consular representatives of other states.</p>

                                <item>As regards the remainder of the draft, I beg leave to suggest
                                    certain slight alterations in the wording to avoid all risk of
                                    ambiguity. It would be preferable that the second paragraph of
                                    the preamble should be amended to read “…Covenant of the League
                                    of Nations in the Treaty of Versailles”. Article 1 would also be
                                    clearer if it were worded “Subject to the provisions of the
                                    present convention the United States consent to the
                                    administration of Palestine by His Britannic Majesty, pursuant
                                    to the mandate recited above”. The first half of article 6 might
                                    with advantage be altered to “… and conventions which are or may
                                    be in force between the United States and Great Britain and the
                                    provisions of any treaties which are or may be in force …”.
                                    Lastly I suggest that the final sentence of article 8 should
                                    begin “The present Convention shall take effect …”.</item>

                                <item>As regards the penultimate paragraph of your note, His
                                    Majesty’s Government agree that the present convention shall be
                                    applicable <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0303"/>to such

                                    cannot concur in the interpretation put by the United States
                                    Government on article 7 of the draft convention as regards
                                    changes in the administration of Trans-jordania, as it is
                                    essential that they be allowed latitude to make changes in the
                                    administration of that territory in such manner as may appear
                                    necessary, provided that such action does not conflict with the

                                    of most-favoured-nation treatment. I desire to assure the United
                                    States Government that American nationals in Palestine will
                                    receive most-favoured-nation treatment, but as no exchange of

                                    be given to the Italian Government I regret that His Majesty’s
                                    Government are not in a position to give the specific assurance
                                    asked for in the last sentence of your note.</item>

                            Government of July 17, 1924 to the communication which you addressed to
                            the British Foreign Office pursuant to the Department’s instructions
                            under date of April 30 last.</p>
                        <p>I desire that you reply to the British Foreign Office communication of
                            July 17 in the following sense: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>My Government has instructed me to acknowledge the receipt of

                                    textual changes and subject to the omission of the second
                                    paragraph of Article 6 the British Government is prepared to
                                    accept the draft convention communicated in my note of April
                                    30.</p>

                                    <item>In view of the assurances contained in the first paragraph
                                        of Your Excellency’s note that the Palestine administration
                                        have every intention of treating American consular officers
                                        in as favorable a manner as the consular representatives of
                                        other States, my Government does not consider that the
                                        retention of the second paragraph of Article 6 is essential.
                                        Further, my Government assents to the minor textual
                                        amendments suggested in the second paragraph of Your
                                        Excellency’s note save that the phrase “the United States
                                        consent,” should read “the United States consents,” <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0304"/>since my Government
                                        regards the term “United States” as singular and not

                                    <item>With regard to the third paragraph of Your Excellency’s
                                        communication which relates to the territory of
                                        Transjordania, I desire to make it clear that it was not my
                                        Government’s intention to suggest the necessity of
                                        consultation in matters relating to minor administrative
                                        changes in Transjordania. Its attention, however, had been
                                        called to the communication of the League of Nations of
                                        September 23, 1922 which indicated that the British
                                        Government, after a consultation with the States represented
                                        on the Council of the League of Nations, had reached an
                                        agreement as to the Articles of the Mandate in addition to
                                        Articles 15, 16 and 18 mentioned in Article 25, which are in
                                        any case applicable, which would control the character of
                                        the British administration of Transjordania. It is my
                                        Government’s view, as briefly set forth in my communication
                                        of April 30 last, that it would be entirely consistent with
                                        the general policy which is followed by States enjoying
                                        mandatory administration over territories relinquished by
                                        the Central Powers as a result of the late war to consult
                                        with this Government as well as with the States represented
                                        on the Council of the League of Nations in connection with
                                        any general changes in the form of the Mandatory
                                        administration of Transjordania.</item>
                                    <label>(4)</label>
                                    <item>My Government had, however, noted the statement contained
                                        in Your Excellency’s communication that the Palestine
                                        Convention shall be applicable to territory under British
                                        Mandate to the east as well as to the west of the River
                                        Jordan and, the further statement, that the changes which
                                        may be made in the administration of the territory will not
                                        be of a character to conflict with the terms of the Mandate.

                            that no assurances are forthcoming from the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the statement that the Iraq Government is now pressing
                            strongly for acceptance of Sassoon’s amendment to Article 34, as
                            reported to us this amendment contemplates that each sublease or
                            transfer of areas, covered by the principal Convention made by the
                            Turkish Petroleum Company Limited shall be subject to the approval of
                            the Iraq Government, on the condition that such approval shall not be
                            unreasonably withheld and shall not embody conditions not contained in
                            the concession. In response to the proposal for this amendment, we urged
                            on behalf of the American Group that a reservation of this right of
                            approval by the Government might, in practice, absolutely vitiate or
                            nullify the practical operation of the Open Door Plan. In this
                            connection it is to be noted that the last cablegram from Mr. Nichols
                            states that Mr. Keeling suggests that the Iraq Government might accept
                            in lieu of the right of approval of subleases, the right to disapprove
                            any particular sublessee.</p>
                        <p>Subject to the Department’s wishes in respect to this important matter,
                            we are considering making a proposal to Mr. Nichols whereby the
                            contentions of the Iraq Government might be met by a provision that it
                            should have the right of disapproval in respect to any particular
                            sublessee where the Government could reasonably contend <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0318"/>that the proposed sublessee or sublease
                            would impair its sovereign rights.</p>
                        <p>It is also our view that the Turkish Petroleum Company Limited should
                            disclose to the Iraq Government the plan for subleasing under Article 34
                            in accordance with its accepted Open Door Policy, and that, as to
                            whether this should be done immediately, or at any time before the
                            execution of the Convention, those in charge of the negotiations should
                            determine.</p>

                        <p>When Mr. Wellman called at the Department on January 22nd I took up with
                            him his letter of January 16th which particularly dealt with the
                            reported insistence of the Iraq Government upon the right to approve
                            companies which, under Article 34 of the proposed concession, might
                            desire to qualify as sublessees of the Turkish Petroleum Company. I said
                            that the Department fully appreciated the importance of this question in
                            its bearing on the future of the subleasing plan which had been
                            formulated by the company and that for this reason the Department felt
                            it was wise to take this opportunity to discuss this matter with him
                            informally before making any reply to his letter. It was appreciated
                            that the Iraq Government, jealous as it would probably be of its newly
                            gained or partially gained sovereignty, might take a strong stand in
                            demanding a right to pass upon companies which were to develop its oil
                            resources. At the same time on the rather meager information which was
                            available it was difficult for the Department, and possibly also for the
                            American Group, to judge to what extent the opposition to the
                            unqualified right to sublease was shared by the British interests in the
                            Turkish Petroleum Company and by Mr. Keeling, the negotiator for the
                            company in Bagdad.</p>
                        <p>The Department did not desire to make unreasonable conditions or to take
                            a position which would render negotiation impossible. At the same time
                            it was necessary to face the facts. If the Iraq Government had the
                            qualified right of passing upon sublessees that government would be in a
                            position to prevent the realization of the subleasing plan which would
                            alter the general understanding upon which the Department’s recent
                            correspondence with the American Group had been carried on.</p>
                        <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0319"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wellman then stated that he had been considering the desirability of
                            action by the American Group to clarify the situation with respect to
                            the attitude of the Iraq Government towards the plan of subleasing. This
                            was a matter in which the companies themselves were deeply interested.
                            If this plan were not carried out it is doubtful whether the proposed 25
                            per cent. participation of the American Group would justify the initial
                            expenditures which the development of the oil resources of Mesopotamia
                            would require. The various American companies desired to qualify as
                            sublessees as well as to have their percentage participation in the
                            Turkish Petroleum Company. The subleasing plan, under the terms of the
                            proposed concession, might not be put into effect for four years and the
                            companies therefore had a natural interest in satisfactory assurances at
                            the time of their participation that the subleasing plan would be put
                            into effect. To my inquiry whether it was therefore correct that the
                            companies themselves were very directly interested in the realization of
                            the subleasing plan from the practical business standpoint as well as on
                            account of their desire to work out an arrangement which would obviate
                            the monopolistic features of the proposed concession, Mr. Wellman
                            answered in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>After further conversation during which the above points were developed,
                            it was my understanding of Mr. Wellman’s views that a telegram would be
                            sent to Mr. Nichols by the American Group indicating it to be the
                            position of the American Group that the right of the Turkish Petroleum
                            Company to make subleases should not be unduly restricted and that the
                            American Group would again suggest the desirability of retaining the
                            present wording of Article 34 and of explaining to the Iraq Government
                            the details of the subleasing plan. The result of this would be to bring
                            to; an immediate issue the question of the attitude of the Iraq
                            authorities towards this plan. While this might result in an
                            interruption of the negotiations and an invitation on the part of the
                            British interests that the American Group should see what they could do
                            through direct negotiations with the Iraq authorities, Mr. Wellman
                            indicated that they would not be unprepared to face this eventuality,
                            although they were not seeking or desiring to eliminate the present
                            British negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In the light of this conversation it was understood that no immediate
                            reply to Mr. Wellman’s letter of January 16 would be awaited by the
                            American Group and that the latter would inform the Department of the
                            telegram which they would send to the Turkish Petroleum Company
                            outlining their views as above indicated.</p>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>While this message contains the words “commenced” and “temporary”, and
                            therefore lacks finality, it indicates a possibly serious situation so
                            far as the Open Door Policy of the State Department regarding
                            Mesopotamia is concerned. The subleasing plan of the Turkish Petroleum
                            Company Limited, which is the practical application of the Open Door
                            Policy of the Department, would be made impossible of operation by the
                            Turkish Petroleum Company Limited if Article 34 is rejected by the Iraq
                            Government. On the assumption that this proposed convention would
                            constitute a new grant by the Iraq Government to the Turkish Petroleum
                            Company Limited, the question of the invalidity of the Turkish Petroleum
                            Company claims founded on the Turkish grants would seem to be
                            eliminated.</p>
                        <p>We have just telegraphed Mr. Nichols asking him the meaning of the phrase
                            “except for drilling contracts,” and pointing out to him that in this
                            country the phrase has two meanings, one which is that of the
                            independent contractor who engages to drill wells upon a property and
                            has no interest in the oil production from the wells, and the other,
                            which contemplates that an operator will take a contract to drill wells
                            and have the right to take a share from all of the oil produced from the
                            wells.</p>
                        <p>In order to facilitate the acceptance of Article 34 by the Iraq
                            Government, we may suggest to Mr. Nichols on behalf of the American
                            Group, subject to the approval of the Department, that the <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0321"/>American Group would approve Article 34
                            with a reservation to the Iraq Government of the right of disapproval as
                            to any particular sublessee where his financial responsibility is not
                            adequate to develop and operate a sublease, or where, after
                            determination by arbitration if necessary, the sublessee is found to be
                            undesirable from the standpoint of the Iraq Government owing to past or
                            anticipated political activities hostile to the Iraq Government.
                            However, this suggestion would not meet the position apparently taken by
                            the Iraq Government committee, which is that its preference for
                            exploitation by the Turkish Petroleum Company is based upon its belief
                            in the adequacy of that company’s financial and technical resources.</p>
                        <p>The American Group will appreciate having the Department’s views on the
                            subject matter of this letter, with any additional suggestions that may
                            occur to it, to the end that the Open Door Policy of the Department may
                            be adequately realized through the pending negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I shall get in communication with you tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>You will note the importance attached to the retention of Article 34. The

                            <p>Referring your cables January 28th and 30th Article 34 is only one in
                                proposed convention which gives full effect to open door formula
                                which was the fundamental principle accepted by partners in Turkish
                                Petroleum Co. prior to a discussion and agreement with American
                                Group of the other details. Deletion of Article 34 might result in
                                elimination of American Group’s participation in Turkish Petroleum
                                Co. We are absolutely confident that if your Foreign Office will
                                support Keeling in his contention that Article 34 is essential that
                                present impasse will be successfully overcome. As to possible
                                disclosure of Open Door plan we confirm views expressed in our cable
                                January 23rd and our letter October 25th. We are ready to send
                                someone from here to cooperate with Keeling if you decide it is
                                desirable that this disclosure should be made at Bagdad and you
                                desire such cooperation on our part in the matter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Dulles</hi>: A letter under date of the
                            29th ultimo received today from our representative, Mr. Piesse, in
                            London, states that he had just had a long interview with Mr. Nichols;
                            that Mr. Nichols impressed him with the idea that Article 34 in the Iraq
                            Convention will ultimately be agreed to by the Iraq Government in some
                            form or other acceptable to the American Group. Mr. Nichols admits that
                            there has been considerable delay, but says that this has been caused
                            largely by the change of Government in England, for the permanent
                            officials were not prepared to do anything, or discuss the question with
                            him, until the new Government had decided whether or not it <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0323"/>would follow the policy of its
                            predecessors in regard to Mesopotamia generally, and in particular the
                            oil question. Mr. Nichols now says that the Government has indicated
                            that it proposes to follow its predecessors in this respect, and that he
                            had a meeting only on the previous Monday with representatives of the
                            Foreign and Colonial Offices at which he was informed unofficially that
                            the Government would be prepared to instruct the British High
                            Commissioner at Bagdad to support Mr. Keeling in his negotiations with
                            the Iraq Government, and in particular he was to inform the Iraq
                            Government that the British Government was in accord with, and
                            recommended, the Open Door Formula, a complete copy of which has been
                            handed to the British Government, although Mr. Nichols says the Iraq
                            Government has not yet had a copy of it but has been informed of its
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nichols stated also that the French have practically accepted the
                            general scheme for the American participation, including the plan for
                            the Working Agreement;<note n="59" xml:id="d179fn59">See telegram dated

                        <p>Under what is known as the Foreign Office Agreement, dated March 19,
                            1914, Mr. G. S. Gulbenkian, a naturalized British citizen, is accorded
                            in the Turkish Petroleum Company, Ltd. a beneficial 5% interest, without
                            voting rights, all upon terms and conditions as covered by Section 9 of
                            this agreement.</p>
                        <p>The interests of the American Group in the development of a possible oil
                            production in Iraq have been with the sole object that, should a large
                            production be developed there, the American interests would be able to
                            use their proportionate part of this production in the carrying on of
                            their business either at home or abroad. They are interested in Crude
                            Oil as such, as distinct from a financial investment in a company <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0324"/>organized under the laws of a
                            foreign country and the control of which, owing to their preponderant
                            stock interest, would be with foreigners.</p>
                        <p>With this object in view, the American Group proposed to the other three
                            partners, a proposal accepted in principal by them, that the activities
                            of the Turkish Petroleum Company should be limited to the production of
                            the Crude Oil and its delivery to a seaboard terminal where it would be
                            offered for sale as “Crude” to the four Groups, in proportion to their
                            respective stock interests, at a price which should not exceed 7s. per
                            ton above the actual cost of production and delivery at such seaboard
                            terminal.</p>
                        <p>The practical carrying into effect of this plan is now blocked by Mr.
                            Gulbenkian, the owner of the 5% interest, who takes the position that he
                            is not an oil trader, doesn’t want oil, is not interested from the
                            international viewpoint but simply from that of his own personal
                            business interest and profit, and that, in the protection of his own
                            interest, he now insists that the Company should be operated as a
                            complete unit, i. e. engaged, in addition to the production and
                            transporting of the oil to seaboard, in the refining and sale of the
                            products wherever markets could be found for them. This would mean that
                            the American Group would obtain merely a share interest in a foreign
                            company and, as such, entitled merely to participate in profits. The
                            American Group would obtain no Crude Oil direct from such
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>For the past two years the British partners in the Turkish Petroleum
                            Company have been endeavoring to negotiate with Mr. Gulbenkian in the
                            hopes of reaching a basis of settlement with him which would be
                            acceptable to all. Up to July, last, no settlement with him had been
                            reached, and the representatives of the American Group then in London
                            were asked by the other three partners to take up, on behalf of the
                            Turkish Petroleum Company, negotiations direct with Mr. Gulbenkian. The
                            discussions by the American Group’s representative with Mr. Gulbenkian
                            have been unsuccessful. The position which the representative of the
                            American Group has taken is that the American Group had been invited to
                            participate in the Turkish Petroleum Company by the other international
                            groups who had advised the American Group that Mr. Gulbenkian had a 5%
                            non voting share interest in the Company, that the American Group had
                            not been advised that he had any other claims against the Company of any
                            shape or form other than his 5% share interest, and that in so far as
                            this 5% share interest was concerned the American Group were entirely
                            willing that it should be placed on an absolute parity with the share
                            interest of the four Groups. This being the case, the American Group
                            were quite willing to fairly compensate him for his consent to limiting
                            the operations of the Turkish Petroleum Company to production and
                            transportation, that this was absolutely as far as the American Group
                            could go, that it was <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0325"/>impossible for us to compensate him for moral claims which he felt he
                            had against the two English partners.</p>
                        <p>Under date of September 13 the American Group’s representative in London
                            cables that if the original plan of the American Group to receive Crude
                            Oil instead of merely making an investment in an oil company is to be

                                <item>that he receive on all oil produced a royalty of 1s. per ton,

                                    the Turkish Petroleum Company itself but on all oil produced
                                    from the (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) areas covered by the
                                    concession and sublet in accordance with the terms of the

                            </list></p>
                        <p>All of the partners in the Turkish Petroleum Company, including the
                            American Group, considered Mr. Gulbenkian’s proposals so unreasonable
                            and burdensome as to preclude their acceptance.</p>
                        <p>In summary of the foregoing the American Group is faced with two
                            alternative proposals <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>to accept an investment in a producing, transporting, refining
                                    and marketing, foreign oil company or</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>to accept a thoroughly unbusinesslike arrangement for the
                                    obtaining of a share of the Crude Oil to be produced in
                                    Mesopotamia.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The first of these alternatives is unacceptable because the American
                            Group thereby would be unable to obtain Crude Oil, its sole object in
                            desiring to participate in the development of the potential oil
                            resources of Iraq being to secure Crude Oil and to dispose thereof as it
                            might see fit.</p>
                        <p>The second alternative is as a business proposition unacceptable because
                            what Mr. Gulbenkian demands is entirely out of proportion to what he is
                            entitled to from the standpoint of his 5% non-voting share interest.</p>
                        <p>On the assumption that the American Group refuses both of these
                            alternatives it is probable that the three foreign groups would continue
                            the negotiations with Iraq and unless the State Department intervenes
                            obtain the concession. The American Group has been told by the British
                            partners that the Articles of Incorporation of the Company which would
                            exploit this concession would include the <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0326"/>Open Door (Subleasing) formula<note n="60" xml:id="d180fn60"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_243"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 243</ref>.</note> which would enable an
                            American Group or company to sub-lease from the exploiting company
                            possible oil producing territories in those portions of Iraq covered by
                            the concession other than the 24 areas reserved to the exploiting
                            company.</p>
                        <p>The American Group’s position is that in the event of its withdrawal
                            under the circumstances above outlined, the mere inclusion of the Open
                            Door (Subleasing) formula in the Articles of Incorporation of the
                            exploiting company would not guarantee to American interests equal
                            participation in the development of the natural resources of Iraq. As
                            already pointed out, the reason for the formation of the American Group
                            and its continued object throughout the negotiations has been to obtain
                            a proportionate share of such Oil as might be produced in Iraq. The
                            Group was not formed with any idea of becoming merely an investor in a
                            foreign oil company. Its sole object was to obtain actual Crude
                            petroleum. The realization of this object, it holds, is the sole
                            condition which would have as its effect fair participation of American
                            interests in the development of the natural resources of Iraq. The State
                            Department has stood for such participation. It is therefore the desire
                            of the Group that the State Department facilitate the realization of its
                            object. This realization, it suggests, can be obtained by the addressing
                            to the Ambassador at London of an instruction directing him to make the
                            necessary representations to the British Foreign Office to this end.
                            This apparently cannot be brought about unless Mr. Gulbenkian, a
                            naturalized British subject, accept on a reasonable basis the principle
                            that the oil produced in Iraq shall be divided amongst the partner
                            companies or groups, rather than that the profits of any joint
                            enterprise entered into should be so divided.</p>

                        <p>331. 1. The Department has been informed by representatives of the
                            American group of oil companies that according to advices from London it
                            is probable that a conclusion will soon be reached in the negotiations
                            now pending at Bagdad by which the interests represented by the Turkish
                            Petroleum Company hope to obtain the grant of a concession from the
                            Government of Iraq. The Department is also informed that the terms upon
                            which the American group is to <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0327"/>participate in the company have not yet been fully agreed upon.
                            Obstacles to an agreement have been created recently by Gulbenkian, an
                            Armenian naturalized in Great Britain, who holds a stock interest of
                            five per cent in the company as organized in 1914. The position taken by
                            Gulbenkian has apparently prevented an arrangement for the division of
                            any crude oil which the Turkish Petroleum Company may produce in
                            Mesopotamia under the new concession which it may obtain. Gulbenkian’s
                            position is considered unreasonable by the American group. The latter
                            have indicated that during more than two years of negotiation with the
                            Turkish Petroleum Company they have steadily maintained that their
                            object is to obtain their proper share of the actual oil produced, and
                            that a mere stock participation in the Turkish Petroleum Company does
                            not interest them. They have further stated that their British and
                            French associates understood this position perfectly and had accepted it
                            before the late difficulties arose with Gulbenkian in arranging a
                            settlement. Apparently those difficulties have brought up again the
                            question of participation through stock ownership between the American
                            and foreign groups. The American group has indicated that if this
                            position is insisted upon by the other interests they may themselves
                            withdraw from participation.</p>
                        <p>2. The Standard Oil Company is instructing Mr. Wellman, who is
                            representing the American group in London, to explain the situation
                            fully to the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>3. In matters of business negotiation the Department could not, of
                            course, properly intervene, and with regard to the negotiations of the
                            American group this principle has been consistently maintained. The
                            American group has, however, kept the Department in touch with the
                            course of affairs. The position of this Government has been already
                            fully communicated to the Embassy in the pertinent correspondence, and
                            is briefly recapitulated below: <list>

                                <item>This Government has contributed to the common victory, and has
                                    a right, therefore, to insist that American nationals shall not
                                    be excluded from a reasonable share in developing the resources
                                    of territories under mandate. In this view the British
                                    Government has concurred.</item>

                                <item>In Mesopotamia the principle of equality of commercial
                                    opportunity and of the Open Door should be maintained. The
                                    British Government does not dissent from this view.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>This Government regards as invalid the alleged rights of the
                                    Turkish Petroleum Company as based on negotiations before the
                                    war. If claims should be advanced on the strength of those
                                    negotiations, it has been suggested by this Government that they
                                    be submitted to arbitration for settlement.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                <item>More than two years ago the Department was informed that the
                                    American group included all American companies which wished <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0328"/>to participate. The
                                    Department felt, therefore, that, having regard to the practical
                                    requirements of the case, it should not oppose an attempt of the
                                    Turkish Petroleum Company to obtain a new concession provided
                                    that under the new arrangement a fair participation should be
                                    accorded to the interested American companies.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>4. The sole object of the Department in concerning itself with the
                            negotiations of the American companies has been to secure recognition of
                            the principles for which this Government has stood throughout. Since the
                            negotiations among the various groups interested in the Turkish
                            Petroleum Company have looked toward arriving at a basis for American
                            participation in Mesopotamian development, the Department has felt that
                            if the arrangements arrived at were properly drawn up progress would
                            have been made toward meeting the views which this Government has
                            steadily advanced in its representations to the British Government
                            regarding the rights of American nationals.</p>
                        <p>5. It is possible, however, that these negotiations may break down
                            through no failure of the American companies to accept reasonable terms
                            of participation. And inasmuch as the British interests hold a special
                            position in negotiating with Iraq, since the British Government is the
                            mandatory there and possesses special prerogatives in Iraq under
                            treaties concluded with the Government of Iraq, it is also possible,
                            therefore, that the British interests may try to obtain concessionary
                            rights in Mesopotamia without according a fair share in them to the
                            American companies ready and willing to participate. In that case the
                            Department would carefully consider what steps it should take under the
                            altered circumstances in order to protect American interests. This
                            Government might be compelled to revert to the position it assumed in
                            correspondence with the British Government, and to oppose resolutely any
                            plan which did not give adequate recognition to the principle of the
                            Open Door and which did not afford an application of this principle in
                            the treatment of American companies which for more than two years have
                            shown a steady and serious desire to participate on any just and
                            reasonable terms in the development of Mesopotamian oil fields.</p>
                        <p>6. You should bring at once to the attention of the Foreign Office the
                            views set forth in the three preceding paragraphs. This may be done
                            orally, but you should indicate that while the Department contemplates
                            addressing the British Government formally on the subject, you have been
                            instructed to discuss it informally in the first instance as it is the
                            belief of this Government that the British Government has no desire to
                            see anything done which might end in an attempt to exclude American
                            interests from a proper participation in developing Mesopotamian
                            resources.</p>
                        <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0329"/>
                        <p>7. The outcome of your interview, as also the precise status of Wellman’s
                            negotiations with the Turkish Petroleum Company, should be promptly
                            telegraphed to the Department. As soon as the Department has received
                            your report it will consider what further steps should be taken. If a
                            satisfactory agreement can be reached in consequence of the
                            representations you make and without resorting to more formal measures,
                            it would, of course, be a source of gratification to the Department. But
                            it is very important that matters should not be permitted to arrive at
                            the stage at which we would be faced by the accomplished fact of an
                            agreement between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Government of
                            Iraq before the American companies have secured their own interests
                            under a proper agreement.</p>
                        <p>8. You should read again the Department’s instructions 630 of August 31,
                            1922, and 809 of February 10, 1923,<note n="61" xml:id="d181fn61">Neither printed.</note> as also the Monthly Political Reports of

                        <p>393. The matter referred to in the Department’s 331, of September 20, was
                            discussed in detail today with an official of the Foreign Office, and an
                            intimation was given of our hope that we could reach a settlement
                            through informal discussion rather than by making formal representations
                            to the Foreign Office. Mr. Wellman had already several times conferred
                            with me. At the Foreign Office I received positive assurance that they
                            have a sincere desire to see a fair participation given to the American
                            interests and to expedite the conclusion of arrangements already drawn
                            up and agreed to by the four groups concerned. Nichols of the Turkish
                            Petroleum Company had already brought to the attention of the Foreign
                            Office the obstructive attitude of Gulbenkian, and at interview today
                            the Foreign Office official intimated on his own initiative that he
                            would try to find out whether Gulbenkian’s attitude might not somehow be
                            altered.</p>

                        <p>424. My 393, September 24, 4 p.m. I had applied for interview recently
                            with the Foreign Office regarding Turkish petroleum matter. It appears
                            that the Foreign Office has had several conferences with Gulbenkian or
                            his representative, obtaining his point of view in the differences
                            between him and the groups, and after careful consideration is of the
                            opinion that Gulbenkian’s contentions are founded on practical and legal
                            grounds not to be disregarded. The policy of the Foreign Office is
                            similar to that of the Department in that it will not intervene in
                            business negotiations or disputes, but is ready to use all good offices
                            in order to compose if possible differences between parties concerned.
                            Foreign Office feels that recent offers of Turkish Petroleum Company to
                            Gulbenkian are quite reasonable and hopes that latter will see his way
                            clear to accepting them. On the other hand the intention of the Foreign
                            Office is to urge the British group to use moderation and deal with
                            Gulbenkian reasonably. It is hoped that the Department will
                            correspondingly urge this attitude upon the American group.</p>
                        <p>I was again assured most emphatically that the British Government desires
                            that United States nationals should have equal representation in the
                            exploitation of the Mesopotamian oil fields and that the “working
                            agreement” should become effective. Foreign Office understands clearly
                            the Department’s view as to the consequences which might arise from the
                            failure of the “working agreement” to be concluded.</p>
                        <p>Wellman tells me that while Gulbenkian has so far refused the offers of
                            the Turkish Petroleum Company, negotiations are continuing and that
                            there is hope of a settlement this week. The heads of the several
                            groups, as well as Gulbenkian, are now in London.</p>

                                            Gulbenkian settlement made. Now planned that Turkish

                                            next Tuesday and that four groups shall thereafter sign
                                            second contract. Meantime French group now expected to
                                            agree settlement N. Gulbenkian on the basis of 1
                                            shilling per ton whereupon discussion with N. Gulbenkian
                                            will be resumed. Pressure for early granting of
                                            concession seems to be relieved and Keeling advises that
                                            concession will not be granted before Dec. 15th. M.

                            Mr. Teagle in reply to the inquiry in his letter of November 28th, he
                            called me on the telephone this afternoon and asked whether the
                            Department had any comment to make on his letter. I told him, in reply,
                            that while the Department would not, of course, desire to advise the
                            Group in connection with a business matter, such for example as their
                            taking shares in the Turkish Petroleum Company, the Department’s view
                            that the Turkish Petroleum Company had no valid concession had undergone
                            no change whatever and that therefore if American companies participated
                            in the Turkish Petroleum Company they would, so far as we were
                            concerned, be participating in a company which had acquired no valid
                            concessionary rights as yet. Mr. Teagle said he fully appreciated this
                            position and that it appeared to be the opinion of the Group, which was
                            then meeting, that they should maintain their position that they would
                            not take shares in the Company until the concession were actually
                            granted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Teagle then asked whether the Department had any comment to make on
                            the longer telegram quoted in his letter of November 28th. I said that,
                            as I recalled, this telegram related largely to business matters and
                            that I did not believe that there was any point therein upon which the
                            Department would desire to comment. Mr. Teagle said that the Group would
                            probably agree to the arrangement outlined in this telegram.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Dulles</hi>: Since my return from London on
                            Tuesday last, Mr. Dodge told me of his recent conference with you and
                            your inquiry regarding the phraseology of Article 34 of the proposed
                            concession from the Iraq Government to the Turkish Petroleum Company,
                            with particular reference to the subleasing plan.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure the adoption of the plan against any objecting
                            minority shareholder of the Turkish Petroleum Company, we proposed that
                            the elements of the subleasing plan should be embodied in the draft
                            concession as a condition of the grant. This suggestion was adopted, and
                            Mr. Keeling at Bagdad was instructed to endeavor to bring this about by
                            agreement with the Iraq Government. While we have not been advised as to
                            the definite acceptance of this suggestion by the Iraq Government, the
                            proposed draft concession contains, in Articles 5 and 6, the definite
                            obligation of the Turkish Petroleum Company to select its twenty-four
                            plots of eight square miles each not later than the third 31st of
                            October after the date of the convention, and to construct a pipe line
                            as soon as it shall become commercially justifiable. In Article 6 it is
                            also stipulated that the Company shall, not later than four years after
                            the date of the convention, and annually thereafter, carry out the
                            provision of offering not less than twenty-four plots of eight square
                            miles each, “subject to the provisions of Article 34 hereof,” for
                            competitive bidding between all responsible corporations, firms and
                            individuals without distinction of nationality. The other provisions
                            regarding the right of the prospective operator to select plots, and of
                            the furnishing of geological information, together with the provision of
                            30% of the capacity of the Company’s pipe line for the transportation of
                            oil on subleases at a cost not exceeding ½ of one anna per barrel per
                            mile, are included. The sublease shall bind the operator of each plot to
                            drill not less than 1500 feet during the three years after the execution
                            of the sublease, and thereafter not less than 500 feet each year until
                            the plot shall have been fully tested.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Article 34, the Iraq Government has consistently
                            insisted, as a matter of national dignity, that it must have some
                            supervision over the transfer, by way of subleases, of the area covered
                            by the concession. We have continued our insistence that the phraseology
                            of Article 34 should be retained, whereby the right of rejection <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0334"/>of a sublessee by the Iraq
                            Government should be limited to the objection of the proposed sublease
                            on the ground that it would be prejudicial to Iraq political
                            independence or territorial integrity, or that the sublessee is an
                            unreliable person. The Iraq Government has served, in effect, an
                            ultimatum that it must have the right of rejection of a sublessee upon
                            reasonable grounds, and that the other restrictions above-referred to
                            which we proposed must be deleted. The other three groups acquiesced in
                            this change, and the American Group, as a matter of necessity, has also
                            consented to the following phraseology: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Company shall have the right from time to time to underlet
                                    or transfer any part or parts of its rights and obligations
                                    hereunder with respect to portions of the denned area on such
                                    terms as it may think fit, provided always that the Company
                                    shall not transfer its obligations under article 5 hereof, and
                                    that the Company shall give the Government written notice of any
                                    intended underletting or transfer, and the Government shall have
                                    the right on reasonable grounds, to be stated in writing, within
                                    60 days of receipt of such notice, to notify the Company in
                                    writing that they object to such proposed underletting or
                                    transfer, and if such notification be given the Company shall
                                    not proceed with such underletting or transfer; and provided
                                    also that the Company shall accept full responsibility to the
                                    Government for the performance by underlessees and transferees
                                    of all obligations due hereunder.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In view of the provision of Article 6 requiring that a sublease be made
                            to a person without restriction as to nationality, there is no objection
                            to be feared on the ground of nationality, at least so far as Americans
                            are concerned.</p>
                        <p>It is also to be noted that the Turkish Petroleum Company must guarantee
                            to the Iraq Government the performance by each sublessee of all the
                            provisions of the concession applicable to the subleased area in
                            question. Hence, a trivial objection on the ground of lack of financial
                            responsibility or operating experience could hardly be raised by the
                            Iraq Government.</p>
                        <p>While Article 34 is not in exactly the form which I personally would
                            select in order to avoid any delays or complications in the operation of
                            the sub-leasing plan, yet it is essential to recognize that this
                            concession, if granted, is coming from a sovereign government which may
                            properly insist upon some degree of supervision of transfers of the
                            territory under the subleasing plan. In fact, it is also to be noted
                            that in almost all cases of concessionary grants, the right of transfer
                            of the grant or any territory under it is subject to the approval of the
                            granting government.</p>
                        <p>The concession was, when I left London on the 8th instant, still under
                            discussion at Bagdad by Mr. Keeling on behalf of the Turkish Petroleum
                            Company, with the Iraq Government.</p>
                        <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0335"/>
                        <p>Mr. Nichols has given me his personal assurance that Mr. Keeling has been
                            instructed that, if the phraseology of Article 34 as above-quoted be
                            adopted, it must be with the concurrent adoption of Articles 5 and 6
                            which embody, as conditions of the concession, the provisions for
                            carrying out the subleasing plan of the Company.</p>

                            indication of the attitude of the British Government with respect to the
                            preferential tariff now in force in Samoa, in contravention of the
                            Tripartite Convention between Great Britain, Germany and the United

                            that it would be dealt with as quickly as possible. The last word from
                            the British Government was contained in Ambassador Harvey’s telegram No.
                            236 of June 2, 1 p.m. 1922<note n="63" xml:id="d187fn65">Not

                            pressed for an early decision.</p>
                        <p>The Department learns that the New Zealand Order in Council of September
                            3, 1923 which modified customs regulations in Samoa reiterates the
                            position of the New Zealand Government with respect to American goods
                            which by the above mentioned Order are subjected to the same duties as
                            all goods of origin other than British. Furthermore, an Order in Council
                            of September 25, 1923 admits the entry free of duty of German Austrian
                            products. This Government has consistently objected to this
                            discrimination against United States products. At present, articles of
                            British origin enjoy 7½% preference in tariff over American goods.</p>
                        <p>It is obviously desirable that this matter be adjusted at the earliest
                            possible moment in view of the severe losses resulting to American firms
                            having business with Samoa. Department is informed that one large
                            American firm in Samoa has retired from business, the owner attributing
                            his action to the preferential duties established by New Zealand in
                            Western Samoa. It is assumed that you have all the pertinent facts
                            relating to the case at your disposal and that you are thoroughly
                            familiar with this Government’s attitude. If not, the <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0336"/>Department will be glad to cable a
                            summary of its position in the matter.</p>
                        <p>You will please avail yourself of the first appropriate opportunity to
                            take this matter up personally with the Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs pointing out that the action of the New Zealand Government is
                            clearly in violation of Article III of the Convention of 1899, and that
                            the government’s action has resulted in serious loss to American
                            commercial interests. You will also point out the very considerable
                            period of time which has elapsed since this Government first instituted
                            representations, and you will earnestly request that some arrangement
                            may be promptly arrived at which will provide for United States goods
                            being granted complete equality of treatment with British products as
                            provided for in the Tripartite Convention.</p>

                            Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in relation to discriminatory
                            tariff imposed by New Zealand. I explained to him provisions of
                            tripartite convention of 1899 which is still in force, also that the
                            imposition of this tariff was in violation of the principle of mandated
                            German territory which had been conceded by Japan, France, Belgium and
                            by the British Government in exchange of communications in reference to
                            Central African treaty. He said he would take the matter up and insist
                            on an adjustment at an early date; that while he was not familiar with
                            the details occurring during previous administrations he thought delay
                            was due largely to having to deal with colonial governments and the
                            imperial conference which took place last autumn; that he understood
                            that New Zealand claimed some discrimination by the United States in the
                            imposition of port duties against British ships in Samoa. I informed him
                            that I had no knowledge of such discrimination unless it was the
                            collection of fees for issuing consular bills of health for ships
                            clearing from Apia to Pago Pago which were subsequently refunded as not
                            being in accordance with the treaty of 1899. (See enclosures to

                            the honor to enclose a copy, in triplicate, of a note from the Foreign
                            Office dated June 30, 1924, together with its enclosures, concerning the
                            subject in hand, namely the question of the discriminatory tariff
                            imposed by New Zealand on American goods in the British mandate
                            territory of Samoa. It appears that the Government of New Zealand would
                            be willing to accede to the request of the United States Government for
                            national treatment for its commerce and commercial vessels in Western
                            Samoa, provided that the United States Government on its part is willing
                            to give a specific assurance of its understanding that Article 3 of the
                            Convention of 1899 ensures to British commerce and commercial vessels
                            national treatment in that part of Samoa under United States
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>An examination of the full text of the note will show that this raises
                            the question of whether under our Coastwise Trading Act British ships
                            bound for the United States may call at Tutuila and carry goods and
                            passengers between that port and the United States under the same
                            condition as our coastwise ships. I have not had time to examine this

                                <item>You will observe that it is provided in the same article of
                                    that convention that each of the three signatory powers shall
                                    continue to enjoy in respect of their commerce and commercial
                                    vessels in all the islands of the Samoan group privileges and
                                    conditions equal to those enjoyed by the sovereign power in all
                                    ports which may be open to the commerce of either of them. It
                                    will be remembered that in 1911 the United States authorities
                                    had exercised some discrimination against British ships trading
                                    between Pago Pago and Leone in Tutuila. On that occasion
                                    inquiries were made of your government, who stated that Leone
                                    was not a port of entry; but in the course of the correspondence
                                    which ensued the United States Government admitted that British
                                    ships were entitled to the same treatment as United States and
                                    German ships in this respect (in this connection I would refer
                                    you to the note from the State Department to His Majesty’s
                                    Ambassador at Washington of the 5th February, 1912, et
                                        cetera<note n="69" xml:id="d189fn68">Not printed.</note>).
                                    In the same year also a complaint was made by a British firm
                                    that bills of health were being issued gratis by the United
                                    States Consul at Apia to United States vessels trading between
                                    Apia and Pago Pago, while a charge was made for similar bills of
                                    health issued to British vessels trading on the same route. This
                                    complaint being brought to the notice of the United States
                                    Government, it was decided by the State Department in 1913 that
                                    the exaction of fees from British vessels while United States
                                    vessels were exempt was contrary to article 3 of the Convention
                                    of 1899, and instructions were accordingly given for the
                                    collection of such fees to be discontinued (see note from the
                                    State Department to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington, 15th
                                    October, 1913<note n="69" xml:id="d189fn69">Not
                                    printed.</note>). The United States Government were thus, in
                                    1913, of opinion that the convention prevented preference in
                                    this respect being given to United States ships trading with
                                    American Samoa.</item>

                                <item>The Government of New Zealand have also called my attention to
                                    the fact that, owing to the operation of the United States
                                    coast-wise laws, British ships trading from New Zealand to San
                                    Francisco are no longer able to call at Honolulu and to carry
                                    goods and passengers between that port and San Francisco.
                                    Consequently, British ships can no longer call at Honolulu
                                    except those on the Vancouver mail service. It is, therefore, a
                                    matter of considerable importance to the Government of New
                                    Zealand that British ships trading between New Zealand and the
                                    United States should be able to call at Tutuila and, if
                                    necessary, to carry goods and passengers between that port and
                                    the United States under the same conditions as United States
                                    ships.</item>

                                    Government is rather that involved by the extension to American

                                    the Law Officers of the Crown in England and in deference to
                                    their advice has not contended that it is free from those

                            Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to
                            inform you that His Majesty’s Government have come to the conclusion
                            that it is desirable that the handling of matters at Washington
                            exclusively relating to the Irish Free State should be confided to a
                            Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to the United States Government.
                            Such a minister would be accredited by His Majesty The King to the
                            President of the United States and he would be furnished with
                            credentials which would enable him to take charge of all affairs
                            relating only to the Irish Free State. He would be the ordinary channel
                            of communication with the United States Government on these matters.</p>
                        <p>Matters which are of Imperial concern or which affect other Dominions of
                            the Commonwealth in common with the Irish Free State will continue to be
                            handled as heretofore by this Embassy.</p>
                        <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0341"/>
                        <p>The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government would not denote
                            any departure from the principle of the diplomatic unity of the Empire.
                            The Irish Minister would be at all times in the closest touch with His
                            Majesty’s Ambassador and any question which may arise as to whether a
                            matter comes within the category of those to be handled by the Irish
                            Minister or not would be settled by consultation between them. In
                            matters falling within his sphere the Irish Minister would not be
                            subject to the control of His Majesty’s Ambassador nor would His
                            Majesty’s Ambassador be responsible for the Irish Minister’s
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>In communicating to you these proposals, which His Majesty’s Government
                            trust will promote the maintenance and development of cordial relations
                            between the British Empire and the United States, I have been instructed
                            to express the hope that the United States Government will concur in the

                            I have indicated above. As regards questions such as the precedence to
                            be attributed to the Irish Minister or any other points which the United
                            States Government may desire to raise in connection with the
                            appointment, His Majesty’s Government will await the views of the United
                            States Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Under instructions from my Government, I
                            have the honour to bring to your notice the effect on certain British
                            subjects, natives of India resident in the United States, chiefly in the
                            State of California, of the decision rendered by the United States
                            Supreme Court on the 19th of February last in the case of Bhagat Singh
                                Thind.<note n="78" xml:id="d197fn78">261 U. S. 204.</note> The Court
                            ruled that a Hindu, of whatever caste, of full Indian blood, was
                            ineligible for United States citizenship.</p>
                        <p>In certain States, notably California, aliens who are ineligible for
                            citizenship are unable under the local law to possess real property, and
                            it is fully realised by His Majesty’s Government that British Indians
                            resident in these States will thus in future be unable legally to
                            acquire title to real property. I need hardly add that His Majesty’s
                            Government have of course no desire to impugn the right of the United
                            States Government to determine what persons are eligible for United
                            States citizenship.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government desire me, however, to point out that a serious
                            and altogether unwarranted hardship will be imposed on a large number of
                            British subjects if the Supreme Court decision is immediately put into
                            effect, and, still more, if it is given retroactive force. His Majesty’s
                            Government are advised that real property legally acquired by British
                            Indians in California, (in which State the majority of the British
                            subjects affected are situated), prior to <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0347"/>the passage of the first California Alien Land Law on
                            May 19th, 1913, will not be liable to confiscation in consequence of the
                            Supreme Court decision, inasmuch as its owners were not ineligible for
                            citizenship when they acquired the property. His Majesty’s Government
                            trust that the United States Government will concur in this view. On the
                            other hand, it would appear that real property acquired since that date
                            is technically subject to escheat as from the date on which the Supreme
                            Court ruling becomes effective, so my present representations are
                            especially directed towards the attainment of some alleviation for
                            British Indian property owners in this latter category.</p>
                        <p>I have further the honour to point out that there are certain British
                            treaty rights which affect this question. In Article V of the Convention
                            between the United States and Great Britain of March 2nd, 1899,<note n="79" xml:id="d197fn79">Malloy, <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>,
                                1776–1909, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 774.</note> it is
                            provided that most favoured nation treatment may be applied in all that
                            concerns the disposal of real property. The most favoured nation in this
                            case would appear to be Colombia; by the treaty between the United
                            States and Colombia of December 12th, 1846,<note n="80" xml:id="d197fn80"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 302.</note> it is
                            provided, (Article XII,):—”The citizens of each of the contracting
                            parties shall have power to dispose of their personal goods or real
                            estate within the jurisdiction of the other by sale, donation, testament
                            or otherwise”. His Majesty’s Government feel that although, as regards
                            California, under the recent Supreme Court ruling British Indians have
                            technically no title to retain real property acquired since May 19th,
                            1913, they should certainly obtain the benefit of Article V of the
                            Convention of March 2nd, 1899, by being permitted a reasonable period of
                            exemption from the operation of the Supreme Court decision within which
                            to dispose privately of their property. His Majesty’s Government
                            consider that even apart from these treaty stipulations the grant of
                            such a period of respite would be only reasonable, and that it should be
                            accorded to all British Indians who own such property (whether or not
                            escheat proceedings have already been instituted against them), in all
                            cases where the property was acquired in good faith and legally
                            according to the laws in force at the time of its acquisition. His
                            Majesty’s Government suggest that this period of respite should amount
                            to two years (thus coinciding with the period specified in Section 7 of
                            the Alien Land Law of California of 1920) and that the Supreme Court
                            decision should be held operative only as from January 1st, 1925.</p>
                        <p>In communicating to you the above considerations, I would also draw your
                            attention to another aspect of the matter involving hardship to British
                            Indian subjects who have come to the United States <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0348"/>to study. Here again I refer more
                            especially to the conditions obtaining in California. In that State
                            British Indian subjects who are students are affected by the Supreme
                            Court decision owing to the fact that they are classified as
                            non-resident if they are ineligible to citizenship and are thus obliged
                            to pay the comparatively heavy fees demanded of non-resident students.
                            While His Majesty’s Government are aware that intervention in a question
                            of this kind by the Federal Government may be a matter of some
                            difficulty and delicacy, yet they feel sure that if the matter was put
                            to the authorities responsible for determining students’ fees in
                            California and elsewhere through your kind intermediary, they would
                            appreciate the hardship involved to British Indian students if they are
                            suddenly to be called upon to pay greatly increased dues. It would seem
                            not unreasonable that the students already attending courses should be
                            allowed to retain their present status as resident students until their
                            conclusion, and thus not be penalised by being compelled at once to pay
                            the fees required from non-resident students.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government suggest, as a fair and practical solution of
                            these difficulties, that the date on which the Supreme Court ruling of
                            February 19th, 1923, shall be deemed to become effective, shall be
                            January 1st, 1925. Such a solution will involve a triple alleviation of
                            the hardship caused by the Supreme Court ruling to British Indian
                            residents in this country,—hardship which His Majesty’s Government feel
                            sure the United States Government would be reluctant to inflict. In the
                            first place, British Indians who have acquired real property lawfully
                            and in good faith will have the opportunity, to which by treaty they are
                            entitled, to dispose of it without incurring the undeserved total loss
                            which would attend escheat proceedings. In the second place, British
                            Indians who have contemplated immigration to this country with the
                            intention of acquiring real property, and those who may be already in
                            this country and may have possessed such intentions, will have ample
                            warning of the legal disability which would attend such a project. In
                            the third place, British Indian students now resident in the United
                            States, and more especially in California, will be enabled to finish
                            their courses of study under the same conditions in which they commenced
                            them, and due warning will be afforded to British Indians intending to
                            come to study in this country, and more especially in California, that
                            they will, after January 1st, 1925, be liable to the increased fees
                            required from non-resident students.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government feel sure that it is not the intention of the
                            United States Government that British subjects who have, in a bona fide
                            manner and in violation of no Federal or State law, acquired real
                            property in this country, should, through no fault of their own, and
                            owing to the operation of a decision which they could <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0349"/>not possibly have anticipated, be
                            penalised by confiscation to the extent of the entire value of their
                            property or be obliged to suffer a financial burden which might easily
                            entail the abandonment of their studies. His Majesty’s Government have
                            the greater confidence in appealing to the United States Government for
                            a reasonable and equitable solution of this question such as I have
                            suggested above, because His Majesty’s Government understand that it is
                            the policy of the United States Government to resist any measures taken
                            in foreign countries, which would involve confiscation, without due
                            warning, of American property. In particular, I would refer in this
                            connection to the communiqué issued by the Department of State to the
                            press in November last,<note n="81" xml:id="d197fn81">See telegram no.
                                171, Nov. 20, 1922, to the Chargé in Mexico, <ref target="frus1922v02#pg_703"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1922, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p.
                                    703</ref>.</note> in which, with reference to the American
                            interests in Mexico, the following passage occurred:—“We have said that,
                            when a nation has established laws under which investments have been
                            lawfully made, contracts entered into and property rights acquired by
                            citizens of other jurisdictions, it is an essential condition of
                            international intercourse that there shall be no resort to confiscation
                            and repudiation”. In view of this attitude in the matter of American
                            property and interests in foreign countries, I feel sure that the United
                            States Government will not be averse to affording, in the case of
                            British Indians in the United States and more especially in California,
                            a similar measure of protection for their property and interests.
                            Moreover, the fact that many of the British Indians in question obtained
                            their United States naturalization while serving as United States
                            soldiers during the war will, I feel sure, render the competent
                            authorities of the United States Government the more sympathetic to
                            their case and the more favourably disposed to ensure that equitable
                            treatment shall be afforded to them in this matter.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I have the honour to point out that inasmuch as in several
                            cases in California the Attorney General has already begun proceedings
                            for the escheat of the property of British Indians in execution of the
                            Supreme Court ruling, the matter is one of considerable urgency if an
                            equitable settlement is to be reached before these unfortunate British
                            Indians are called upon to incur the grave financial loss and hardship
                            inseparable from the confiscation of their property. The case of British
                            Indian students in California is also urgent as I understand that as far
                            as the University of California is concerned, it is intended to exact
                            non-resident fees from British Indians at the beginning of the
                            approaching semester.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances I have the honour, under instructions from my
                            Government, to ask you to be so good as to draw the <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0350"/>urgent attention of the competent
                            authorities to these questions in order that they may take into
                            immediate consideration the solution I have suggested above, and I trust
                            that having regard to the treaty rights involved and in the interests of
                            equity and justice, they may see their way to concur in the proposals
                            put forward by His Majesty’s Government and to take action without delay
                            with a view to their execution.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my note No. 812 of September 19th last
                            I submitted to you certain considerations regarding the hardship which
                            will be inflicted upon British Indian subjects resident in the United
                            States, and especially in California, if the Supreme Court decision of
                            February 19th last in regard to the ineligibility of British Indians for
                            United States citizenship is to be enforced immediately or made
                            retroactive, and I enquired whether it would not be possible to postpone
                            the date of enforcement in order to minimize this hardship.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Consul-General at San Francisco now informs me that a
                            report has appeared in the press to the effect that United States Judge
                            William P. James of Los Angeles has already cancelled the naturalization
                            certificate of Mr. Tulsa Earn Mamdal, a Hindu residing in Fresno County,
                            California. On the other hand, information has reached me to the effect
                            that the confiscation, under the terms of the Supreme Court decision, of
                            certain property belonging to a British Indian at Orange Vale Colony,
                            Fairoaks, California, has been postponed until April in order to give
                            the owner more time to dispose of his property.</p>
                        <p>I have the honour to enquire whether the report as to the cancellation of
                            T. K. Mamdal’s naturalization is correct and, in view of the leniency
                            displayed in the matter of the confiscation of the property mentioned
                            above, which I am sure will be greatly appreciated by His Majesty’s
                            Government, I would express the hope that, in the light of the arguments
                            put forward in my note under reference, it may also be possible to defer
                            the operation of the Supreme Court decision in the matter of the
                            cancellation of naturalizations.</p>
                        <p>You will appreciate that the present uncertainty as regards the status of
                            these Indians and their property places them in a position of
                            considerable difficulty, and I have the honour to request that you will
                            be so good as to communicate to me, at your earliest convenience, the
                            decision of the United States Government on this question.</p>

                            California, had cancelled the naturalization certificate of Mr. Tulsa
                            Earn Mamdel, a Hindu residing in Fresno County, California, I have the
                            honor to state that a communication has been received from the
                            appropriate authority of this Government stating that a decree of
                            cancellation of this man’s naturalization certificate was entered by the
                            United States District Court, Los Angeles, California, on November 17,
                            1923.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the matter of deferring proceedings to cancel
                            naturalization in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of
                            the United States in the case of Bhagat Singh Thind, I have the honor to
                            state that the appropriate authority of this Government has informed me
                            that a recommendation was contained in the last Annual Report of the
                            Commissioner of Naturalization that Congress should pass a law relieving
                            from doubt the title to citizenship acquired by Asiatic aliens who
                            served in the armed forces of the United States during the World War and
                            who were naturalized under the provisions of the Act of May 9, 1918. It
                            is further stated that with the exception of a test case now pending in
                            Boston, involving a Japanese subject who was in the Navy during the war
                            and who obtained naturalization under the provisions of the Act of
                            Congress approved May 9, 1918 (40 Stat. L. 542), cancellation
                            proceedings have not been instituted in the cases of members of Asiatic
                            races who acquired naturalization through this means.</p>
                        <p>The only cases that remain are those of Hindus who were naturalized under
                            the provisions of the general naturalization laws, against whom
                            cancellation suits have been filed as a result of the decision of the
                            Supreme Court in the Thind case. According to information furnished by
                            the Commissioner of Naturalization, approximately fifty cases are
                            involved in this category and of these approximately fifteen cases have
                            already been terminated by decrees of cancellation and of the remaining
                            cases cancellation suits have already been begun and are now pending in
                            the courts. About one-third of the total number of Hindu cancellation
                            suits arose in California, and as it is considered unlikely that all of
                            the California Hindus have acquired real property, it is believed that
                            the total number of those who might be adversely affected by the
                            proceedings is small.</p>
                        <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0352"/>
                        <p>With respect to the postponement of cases involving Hindus now pending,
                            as well as any cases falling within this class that may hereafter arise,
                            in order that these persons may have until January 1, 1925 to protect
                            property rights which they believed they acquired, it is stated that it
                            is doubted whether this action would have the desired effect, because
                            under the decision of the Supreme Court in the Thind case, these persons
                            were never eligible for naturalization and, hence, their naturalization
                            was void <hi rend="italic">ab initio.</hi></p>
                        <p>I shall appreciate it if you will be so good as to furnish detailed
                            information concerning the names of British Indians whose property
                            rights are involved and the extent of their holdings of land in the
                            various States. Upon receipt of this information further consideration
                            will be given to the matter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In the note which you were so good as to
                            address to me on April 2nd last regarding the property rights acquired
                            by British Indians in certain States of the Union, you enquired whether
                            detailed information could be furnished to you concerning the names of
                            the persons involved, and the extent of their holdings in land: you
                            added that on the receipt of this information, further consideration
                            would be given to the whole matter.</p>
                        <p>I have made the necessary enquiries from His Majesty’s Consular officers
                            in the States involved, and as a result of their reports I have the
                            honour to enclose a list comprising the names of 95 Indians,<note n="83" xml:id="d200fn83">Not printed.</note> who hold either jointly or
                            individually, separate tracts of land of a total area of 1868 acres
                            valued at approximately $1,328,000. In this connection I would however
                            point out that the list is still incomplete for not only does it not
                            include property holders in the Imperial Valley, Southern California,
                            but also because, in several cases, only the name is given of one of the
                            joint owners: but on the other hand, I must add that the names therein
                            included are to the best of my knowledge those of bona fide property
                            holders, the valuation of whose estates has been made on very
                            conservative premises.</p>
                        <p>In the note which he addressed to you on September 19th last, Mr. Chilton
                            made it clear that my Government in no way desired to impugn the right
                            of the United States Government to determine what persons are eligible
                            for United States citizenship, nor to contest <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0353"/>the validity of the laws in force in
                            certain States by which aliens who are ineligible for citizenship are
                            unable to possess real property. The suggestions of His Majesty’s
                            Government, to which Mr. Chilton gave expression, were to the effect
                            that the inevitable hardships, ensuing from the decision of the United
                            States Supreme Court of February 19, 1923, might possibly be mitigated
                            if the competent United States authorities could see their way to
                            extending the period of time within which the properties held by British
                            Indians should be liquidated: and in this hope, His Majesty’s Government
                            ventured to propose, as a fair and practical solution of these
                            difficulties, that the date on which the Supreme Court ruling shall be
                            deemed to become effective, should be January 1st, 1925.</p>
                        <p>While still adhering to the views expressed in September, His Majesty’s
                            Government now feel that as the United States authorities have not yet
                            found it possible to give a final decision in this matter, the delay,
                            within which the ruling should be made effective, might with fairness to
                            all parties concerned be extended for a further period of twelve months
                            and become January 1st, 1926. His Majesty’s Government cannot but
                            reiterate that they do not wish to lay emphasis on questions of
                            naturalization, or of eligibility or ineligibility for citizenship
                            through naturalization, but rather on the patent hardship accruing to
                            those Indians who have continuously retained their British nationality
                            and who are now threatened with the forfeiture of legally acquired
                            property rights. From the merely practical point of view, the British
                            Indians in question will in any case be faced with conditions which will
                            adversely affect their chances of selling their property at fair prices:
                            the fact that these various Estates will be thrown upon the market more
                            or less simultaneously will tend to reduce prices, at a time when there
                            is likely to be a period of agricultural depression in California owing
                            to the abnormally dry winter and to the serious outbreak of Foot and
                            Mouth disease, and when the leases of land held under cropping contracts
                            (amounting in the case of British Indians to 86,340 acres in 1920) will
                            also be falling in.</p>
                        <p>My Government hopes therefore that the United States Government will see
                            its way to considering as favourably as possible the views expressed
                            above on the general question, and will urge upon the State authorities
                            involved the possibility of alleviating, within the limits suggested,
                            the hardships which the British Indians in this country are being
                            unexpectedly called upon to face.</p>
                        <p>At the same time I should be glad to learn whether or not the United
                            States Government concurs in the views expressed in the third paragraph
                            of Mr. Chilton’s note above-mentioned, to the effect that real property
                            legally acquired by British Indians in California, prior to the passage
                            of the first Californian Alien Land Law on <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0354"/>May 19, 1913, will not be liable to confiscation for
                            the reasons therein adduced. An expression of your views on this
                            question would be of particular value, because certain of the British
                            Indians who figure in the attached list did in fact purchase land before
                            May 19, 1913: namely No. 9, Fattu Peero purchased 10 acres at
                            Orangevale, California, in 1910; No. 10, Charles Sri Earn purchased 10
                            acres in 1912, No. 21, Budh Singh purchased 20 acres, out of the 75 now
                            jointly held, prior to 1913. In this connection I would observe that
                            Charles Sri Earn was threatened with the confiscation of his holding in
                            1922 (at a date prior to the ruling of the Supreme Court) on the ground
                            of his ineligibility to citizenship, but because purchase of part of his
                            holding had been effected in 1912, the State Court dismissed the case.
                            Moreover, you will observe that No. 8 on the attached list, Earn Nath
                            Puri, holder of 10 acres of agricultural land, was naturalized in 1916
                            as a citizen of this country, and you will doubtless concur with me in
                            considering that his is a case deserving the most sympathetic treatment
                            prior to expropriation.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I have the honour to reiterate my request that you will be
                            so good as to draw the urgent attention of the competent authorities to
                            these questions, in order that they may consider with the least delay
                            possible the solution which I have suggested above. I venture to hope
                            that they will see their way to concur in His Majesty’s Government’s
                            proposals in the interest of equity and justice.</p>

                            communication has now been received from the Governor of California,
                            enclosing a copy of a letter he had received from the Attorney General
                            of that State, dealing with this matter. The letter from the Attorney
                            General of California reads in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In reply to your request for my views on this subject, I would
                                    say, first, that it is of course clear that there can be no
                                    postponing of the date when the United States Supreme Court
                                    decision referred to becomes effective. It is now effective and
                                    controlling with reference both to all public officials, and
                                    also to the various land holders of this state.</p>
                                <p>“I would say, however, that it has been the view of this office
                                    from the very inception of the alien land legislation that the
                                    spirit and <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0355"/>purposes of
                                    that legislation will be best carried out if we encourage the
                                    sale by ineligible aliens of such land as they might hold. This
                                    will not only carry out the purposes of the act but will be
                                    aiding in the solution of this question in a way that will
                                    obviate unnecessary hardships.</p>
                                <p>“I am pleased to be able to state that, generally speaking, there
                                    has been an active cooperation on the part of the various
                                    district attorneys of the state in pursuing a policy which will
                                    lead to the desired result of so accomplishing the fundamental
                                    purposes of our alien land legislation. I am, therefore,
                                    prepared to state that so far as the attitude of this office is
                                    concerned we would be pleased, under the circumstances, to
                                    cooperate with your office in urging that the general policy
                                    requested by the British Embassy be carried out, to the end that
                                    unnecessary hardships be avoided, and to the further end that
                                    the real interests of the state be served by permitting the
                                    title to these lands to be finally vested in those qualified,
                                    under our law, to hold the same. The right of such persons so
                                    holding the legal title to lands to sell and convey good title
                                    to the same at any time prior to the institution of proceedings
                                    for escheat is generally conceded.</p>
                                <p>“With reference to the question of the right to escheat those
                                    lands which were lawfully acquired prior to the enactment of our
                                    Alien Land Act in 1913, I am of the opinion that the lands so
                                    lawfully acquired are not subject to escheat under the terms of
                                    our Alien Land Act.</p>
                                <p>“With reference to the other question of the rights of a Hindu
                                    who was naturalized as a citizen of the United States, it is, of
                                    course, clear that this naturalization was not lawful under the
                                    rule now established by the United States Supreme Court. I
                                    realize that several United States District Courts did in fact
                                    grant naturalization to these Hindus under a mistaken impression
                                    that they were ‘white persons’, as that expression is used in
                                    the United States Naturalization Statute. These decisions were
                                    subject to final review by the Supreme Court. This review has
                                    been had and the decision of the Supreme Court has shown that
                                    the attempt to naturalize these people was unauthorized by
                                    law.</p>
                                <p>“I do believe, however, that there is an element of justice here
                                    to be considered, and that so far as possible reasonable time
                                    should be extended to these aliens, who were so erroneously
                                    naturalized, within which to dispose of their property. These
                                    questions can be solved in accordance with law and at the same
                                    time accomplish the real ends of the state, without visiting
                                    harsh or unnecessary hardships upon individuals who in good
                                    faith accepted privileges which were erroneously granted to
                                    them.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Greece.</hi>—The death of the late King Alexander of
                            Greece was followed in December, 1920, by the return to Athens of
                            Constantine. In accordance with the usual practice in the case of
                            monarchial countries, the Greek representative in Washington tendered
                            new letters of credence the acceptance of which would have constituted
                            formal recognition of the new government. In view of the special
                            circumstances which attended Constantine’s return to Athens, it was
                            deemed important, before according recognition, to take into account not
                            only the part that Constantine had played in the war but also the policy
                            of the new regime with regard to the acts and obligations of its
                            predecessor and the attitude of the associates of the United States in
                            the war. With respect to Constantine’s attitude toward the engagements
                            of the former Government, there was for a time an uncertainty whether
                            Constantine considered the government of King Alexander as a <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> government. This was important, for if
                            the Government of the United States had extended recognition it might
                            have put itself in a position of acquiescing in a possible review of the
                            acts of King Alexander’s Government which had borrowed substantial sums
                            from the United States. It will also be recalled that none of the
                            principal Allied Powers recognized Constantine subsequent to his
                            return.</p>
                        <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0357"/>
                        <p>So far as the records indicate, these considerations controlled the
                            policy of the United States Government during the period subsequent to
                            Constantine’s return and prior to March, 1921. Upon the change of
                            administration the question arose whether there was a sufficient reason
                            for changing this policy and for taking a course of action different
                            from that followed by the Allied Powers. Other considerations had
                            intervened making affirmative action in the matter of recognition
                            undesirable. Constantine developed a militaristic policy in Asia Minor,
                            in which Greece was already engaged, by which he desired to justify his
                            hold upon the throne.</p>
                        <p>Separate action by the United States at this time could hardly have been
                            interpreted otherwise than as an expression of sympathy and support by
                            this Government for this policy of Constantine and as an indirect
                            participation in the politics of the Near East which it was desired to
                            avoid. The wisdom of refusing recognition was indicated by the overthrow
                            of Constantine when Greek military plans in Asia Minor failed, an
                            overthrow which was attended by a complete revolution. It will be
                            recalled that Constantine fled the country and that his prominent
                            supporters and cabinet ministers were arrested and after summary trials
                            were executed. The British Government, which previously had maintained a
                            chargé d’affaires in Athens, although not recognizing Constantine,
                            withdrew this representative, while the representatives of other powers,
                            including that of the United States, took occasion to interpret to the
                            Greek authorities the unfortunate impression which the execution of the
                            Greek ministers had caused.</p>
                        <p>The régime which succeeded that of Constantine was frankly based on
                            military power and did not regularize its position by holding elections.
                            Meanwhile the negotiation of a treaty of peace between the Allied
                            Powers, Greece and Turkey, was undertaken at Lausanne, and it seemed
                            undesirable, pending the conclusion of these negotiations, for the
                            United States to take separate action in the matter of recognition.</p>
                        <p>The situation has now materially changed. The Lausanne negotiations have
                            been concluded, peace has now been ratified by Greece and Turkey, and
                            elections were held in Greece on December 16, 1923. These elections, it
                            is hoped, will result in the establishment of a government which will
                            enable this Government to extend formal recognition. The fact that
                            recognition has not been extended during the past three years does not
                            indicate an attitude of unfriendliness toward the Greek people. What
                            American agencies have done in assisting the refugees in Greece is clear
                            evidence to the contrary, and this humanitarian work could not have been
                            carried out more effectively even if formal relations had been resumed,
                            thanks to the initiative of American agencies and the helpful
                            cooperation of the Greek authorities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I feel that the time has
                            come to take such action as is possible to resume, on a more formal
                            basis, the diplomatic relations between this country and Greece. On
                            pages 17–19 of my address on January 23d before the Council of Foreign
                            Relations of New York, of which I enclose a copy, I briefly outlined our
                            recent relations with Greece;<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">See telegram
                                no. 17, Jan. 23, to the High Commissioner in Turkey, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> In concluding I referred to the
                            changed conditions resulting from the conclusion of the Lausanne Treaty
                            and the recent elections in Greece, adding “these elections, it is
                            hoped, will result in the establishment of a government which will
                            enable this Government to extend formal recognition.”</p>
                        <p>On January 13th Mr. Atherton, our representative at Athens, was informed
                            by Mr. Roussos, Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, formerly Greek
                            Minister in Washington, of the formation of a Cabinet under the
                            Presidency of Mr. Venizelos. On January 15th the British representative
                            in Athens, under instructions from his government, informed the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs of his Government’s pleasure in renewing normal
                            diplomatic relations, adding that his Government hoped shortly to be
                            able to appoint a Minister to Athens and asking that meanwhile he be
                            recognized as Charge d’Affaires. On January 24th Mr. Atherton
                                telegraphed<note n="4" xml:id="d203fn4">Telegram not printed.</note>
                            that the Greek Government had been informed that the British Government
                            was immediately sending a Minister to Athens accredited to the King.</p>
                        <p>The treatment of American interests in Greece by the Greek authorities
                            has been satisfactory. While there are a number of outstanding questions
                            between the two countries, particularly the question of the 1918 Loan
                            Agreement with Greece and the funding of Greek indebtedness to the
                            United States, these are questions which have been held in abeyance in
                            the absence of formal recognition and do not afford at this time
                            adequate ground for withholding recognition. It would be desirable to
                            negotiate a commercial treaty with Greece but this again is a matter
                            which would naturally follow rather than precede recognition.</p>
                        <p>In view of this situation I wish to suggest for your consideration the
                            desirability of resuming, on a formal basis, the relations between the
                            United States and Greece. This could be done by the accrediting to the
                            Greek Government of a Chargé d’Affaires ad interim and by the reception
                            of the Greek Charge d’Affaires in Washington. No <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0359"/>change in personnel would be necessary.
                            Mr. Atherton, who has been acting as our representative in Greece, could
                            be instructed to take up formal relations with the Greek Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs pending the appointment of a Minister. This action would
                            be similar to that recently taken in the case of Mexico.<note n="5" xml:id="d203fn5">See <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_522"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, pp. 522</ref> ff.</note></p>
                        <p>The appointment of a Minister, in my opinion, should be delayed until
                            Greece has determined the question which is now being agitated as to
                            whether the country shall continue as a Kingdom or become a Republic.
                            The King of Greece has recently left the country pending the decision of
                            this question, a Regent is functioning in his place. The ultimate
                            decision as to the form of government is one with which I feel we should
                            in no way interfere but this does not preclude the resumption of formal
                            relations with the Greek Government through a Chargé d’Affaires ad
                            interim, postponing the formal accrediting of a Minister to the head of
                            the State until Greece has herself decided—and Mr. Venizelos has
                            proposed a plebiscite to decide the question—whether there shall be a
                            Kingdom or a Republic.</p>
                        <p>I may add that I consider it particularly important to take whatever
                            action is possible to regularize our relations with Greece before the
                            consideration of the Turkish Treaty is taken up by the Senate and for
                            this as well as for the other reasons outlined above I feel that the
                            resumption of diplomatic relations is desirable.</p>
                        <p>In case you concur in the above recommendation I shall be glad to see
                            that the necessary instructions are sent to the Legation at Athens.</p>

                        <p>33. Venizelos overestimated his political strength and consequently has
                            found it necessary to take advantage of temporary illness to retire from
                            an active part in public life. He will, however, remain in Greece.
                            Cafandaris, who has been Minister of Justice in the Venizelos cabinet,
                            is trying to form a coalition cabinet but is finding it difficult
                            because of the varying attitude of political factions in the Assembly
                            toward declaring the throne vacant.</p>
                        <p>This morning I was informed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs that the
                            Greek Ambassador in London, Caclamanos, would probably replace him.</p>

                        <p>43. This morning I received reliable information that as the Cafandaris
                            cabinet is unable to maintain program because of strong republican
                            pressure it is about to resign.</p>
                        <p>The republicans are demanding of the Assembly a declaration that the
                            Glücksburg dynasty is abolished and a pronouncement in favor of a
                            republic, the latter question, however, to be referred to a plebiscite
                            which from present indications will be held in May.</p>
                        <p>Up to now the political situation has been completely indeterminate. A
                            crisis is at hand, however, and it is not at all improbable <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0362"/>that there will be a <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> by the republican army group under General
                            [Condylis?] unless an agreement is reached within a few days.</p>
                        <p>Sir Milne Cheetham, the British Minister, arrived at Athens February 26
                            but did not present his letters of credence until today at noon. The
                            other countries represented here by Minister are Bulgaria, Jugo-Slavia
                            and Spain. I am informed by the Italian Chargé that for all practical
                            purposes his relations with the cabinets of Venizelos and Cafandaris
                            have been such as to constitute recognition of the Greek Government. I
                            learn from French representative that attitude of France has not changed
                            and that the Greek Government has not received French recognition.</p>

                        <p>32. The President wishes to appoint Irwin B. Laughlin, formerly Counselor

                        <p>Make customary inquiry at Foreign Office as to whether appointment is
                            acceptable and report by telegraph. You may orally inform Foreign Office
                            that it has not been determined definitely when Mr. Laughlin will leave
                            for Greece if an <hi rend="italic">agrément</hi> is accorded.</p>
                        <p>You are informed confidentially that the inquiry which you are asked to
                            make should not be interpreted as at all related to present Greek
                            political developments. For some time the President has wished to
                            nominate Mr. Laughlin and the appointment of a Minister has been made
                            possible by the recent recognition given to the Greek Government.</p>
                        <p>As before stated, the time of Mr. Laughlin’s departure has not been
                            determined. It would be a cause for regret should the Greek <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0363"/>Government interpret this step as
                            implying our approval of any particular tendency in the political
                            developments in Greece or give publicity to such an interpretation. Such
                            a situation might delay the Minister’s departure.</p>

                            Senate soon, but should you see serious objection to immediately

                        <p>49. Legation’s 44, March 9, 10 p.m. Papanastasiou assumed office today as
                            Prime Minister, temporarily Minister for Foreign Affairs and temporarily
                            Minister of Finance; General Condylis, Minister of War; and Captain

                            Former Minister of Public Assistance has been replaced by Pazis from
                            Macedonia. New government represents military democrats and its alleged
                            policy is to declare Gliicksburg dynasty dethroned by vote of National
                            Assembly and to declare a republic to be approved by a plebiscite. It is
                            very much doubted locally whether the new government after having
                            assumed the responsibility and accomplishing the formation of a republic
                            will be permitted to continue long in office by its many strong
                            political opponents.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to the resignation of Cafandaris on March 8th and the
                            attendant failure of all Venizelos policies and attempts at a last
                            minute compromise with republicans, Venizelos left Greece for France on
                            March 10th with consequent disintegration of his prestige and
                            influence.</p>

                            with the Greek Government should continue, therefore, on the same basis
                            as for the last two months. The Department will decide to whom
                            Laughlin’s letter of credence should be addressed when the time comes
                            for him to present it. It is presumed that it will be to the Provisional

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: In the absence of a
                            Treaty of Commerce between Greece and the United States, the Hellenic
                            Government has been giving American products the benefit of the
                            Conventional tariff on condition of reciprocity.</p>
                        <p>It has, however, become impossible to continue thus owing to the fact
                            that the tariff now in force is to be superseded in the early future by
                            another tariff which provides for a maximum and a minimum rate.
                            Moreover, for this reason and also in order to harmonize its regime of
                            commerce, navigation and customs, with new economic requirements, the
                            Hellenic Government has just denounced by general measure the treaties
                            by which it was bound to other allied and neutral countries, the state
                            of war having rendered inoperative the treaties with enemy
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>I am therefore, by order of my Government, directed to inform you that

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            note No. 934 of September 10, 1924, in which you were good enough to
                            inform me of the adoption by the Hellenic Government of a tariff policy
                            which is to be realized through the imposition, in the near future, of
                            maximum and minimum customs duties. I note your statement that in the
                            absence of a treaty of commerce between the United States and Greece the
                            Hellenic Government has heretofore accorded to American products the
                            benefit of the conventional tariff on condition of reciprocity, but that
                            this regime will come to an end on December 10, 1924.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to be informed, however, that the Hellenic Government is
                            prepared immediately to enter upon negotiations for the framing of a
                            commercial treaty on the basis of the new Greek tariff policy and with
                            the sincere desire of arriving at a result satisfactory to both
                            goverments.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States desires in the near future to
                            conclude with the Hellenic Government a comprehensive treaty of
                            friendship, commerce and consular rights which may serve as a lasting
                            basis for economic and other intercourse between the two countries and
                            their nationals. Pending the conclusion of such a treaty, however, the
                            Government of the United States desires to propose to the Hellenic
                            Government the immediate conclusion of a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>, to be effected through an exchange of notes, by means
                            of which each country may assure to the commerce of the other
                            unconditional most favored nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>The Tariff Act of 1922,<note n="10" xml:id="d222fn10">42 Stat.
                                858.</note> at present in force in the United States, provides for a
                            regime which may appropriately be compared to a policy of maximum and
                            minimum tariff schedules. Heretofore the minimum tariff only has been in
                            force and has been invariably applied to products originating in Greece.
                            The President is authorized, however, in the event that any country
                            shall fail to accord its lowest rates to products of the United States,
                            to invoke additional duties, which may constitute a sort of maximum
                            tariff against the products of such country.</p>
                        <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0369"/>
                        <p>In view of the existing laws and policies of the United States and of
                            Greece, it seems fitting to propose a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> by the terms of which each country shall accord to the
                            other its lowest rates. Upon assurance of a reply in like terms,
                            therefore, I am prepared to sign and to deliver to you a note setting
                            forth the understanding and intentions of the Government of the United

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My telegram No. 111, December 8th, 9
                                P.M.,<note n="21" xml:id="d226fn21">Not printed.</note> will have
                            informed you that I had found reason to believe that Mr. Roussos had not
                            carried out the promise I reported in my No. 110, December 5th, 5
                                P.M.,<note n="21" xml:id="d226fn22">Not printed.</note> to instruct
                            the Greek Legation in Washington to effect the exchange of notes you
                            desired for establishing a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> to cover
                            the period between the lapse on the 10th instant of the commercial
                            treaty with Greece and the conclusion of another treaty to replace
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I confirmed this by questioning the Chief of the Treaty Section of the
                            Foreign Office, as I was unable to have immediate access to the Foreign
                            Minister, and after making clear to him my feelings and intentions he
                            consented to accompany me forthwith to the Minister whom I found
                            assisting at the sitting of the National Assembly then in progress.</p>
                        <p>I succeeded without much difficulty in convincing Mr. Roussos of your
                            fixed desire to arrange the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            according to the draft note you had communicated to him through the
                            Greek Legation in Washington and through this Legation, and expressed my
                            surprise at his failure to fulfil the promise I had had the honor to
                            report to you. In these circumstances I felt it necessary to insist that
                            he rectify the omission forthwith, but as the telegram he wrote in my
                            presence and read to me seemed to me not altogether certain to bring
                            about the result you desired, since it was susceptible of the
                            construction that the instructions to make the exchange of notes in
                            Washington might be dependent upon future action by the Greek National
                            Assembly, I expressed my dissatisfaction so forcibly that he himself
                            proposed to reassure me by making the exchange in Athens to-day after
                            the action he affirmed the Assembly was on the point of taking to
                            postpone the operation of the new customs tariff for some weeks.</p>
                        <p>Being convinced of your anxiety to arrange definitely a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> before December 10th apart from any
                            problematical Greek legislative action, I felt that this was the only
                            way to make sure of such a result and I therefore took it upon myself to
                            make the exchange with him to-day, not contingent upon any action of the
                            Greek Assembly, but as a positive engagement, subject however to your
                            subsequent confirmation since I had to take account of the <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0372"/>arrangement you expected to carry out
                            of exchanging the notes in Washington. I felt that in view of this
                            intention you perhaps had omitted to inform me as fully as you might
                            have done had your original desire been for me to conclude the business
                            here, so I took the precaution of stating that I would make the exchange
                            subject to your later approval.</p>
                        <p>The exchange of notes was accordingly effected this morning as reported
                            in my No. 112, December 9th, 4 P.M.,<note n="23" xml:id="d226fn23">Not
                                printed.</note> and I have the honor to enclose herewith the two
                            notes establishing the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of which the
                            Greek note is the original and mine the copy, and the copy of the note
                            by which I provided for your explicit assent to it.</p>
                        <p>I also enclose the copy of a Greek note<note n="23" xml:id="d226fn25">Not
                                printed.</note> presented to me at the time of the exchange which
                            tells of the passage last night by the National Assembly of a bill
                            giving the Government power to negotiate with other countries commercial
                            agreements to have a maximum duration of six months. During the
                            discussion of this bill the Finance Minister stated that he had no
                            objection to the postponement of the new tariff until the 1st of March,
                            the Assembly thereafter deciding to follow that course. The Department
                            will form its own conclusion as to the bearing, if any there be, that
                            this note may have upon the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> just
                            concluded. My telegram No. 113, December 9th, 5 P.M.,<note n="23" xml:id="d226fn26">Not printed.</note> reported this tariff
                            postponement.</p>
                        <p>In view of the many objections to the new duties raised during the
                            discussion in the Assembly yesterday evening the Government as well as
                            the party leaders agreed to the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee
                            to study the matter and to make any changes they might consider
                            necessary. One of the reasons for the delay in the application of the
                            tariff is the necessity of giving this Commission a reasonable time for
                            the completion of its work.</p>
                        <p>I take the liberty, in concluding, to express the hope that in examining
                            my action in this case you will consider the fact that it was determined
                            by your anxiously expressed desire to establish a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> without fail on or before December 10th and that
                            in making the exchange of notes here without your instructions, and in
                            fact with the knowledge that it should have been done in Washington, I
                            knew that unless I assumed this responsibility your wishes could not be
                            carried through.</p>

                                aware the Secretary of State has communicated to the Hellenic Chargé
                                d’Affaires in Washington the desire of the Government of the United
                                States to conclude in the near future with the Hellenic Government a

                                which may serve as a lasting basis for economic and other

                            <p>Your Excellency has also been apprised that pending the conclusion of

                                communication embodied in my note No. 74 of to-day’s date which is
                                identical with the text I have received from my Government of the
                                draft note proposed to the Hellenic Legation in Washington, and to
                                add that I propose that this exchange of notes be effected in Athens
                                to-day in default of the exchange of notes that might have taken,
                                place in Washington before the 10th day of December 1924, or in
                                addition to such exchange there, should it occur, with the
                                understanding that in the former case the exchange is effected
                                subject to the confirmation of the Secretary of State in Washington
                                and that in the latter case the exchange of notes in Washington is
                                to be regarded as superseding that of to-day in Athens.</p>
                            <p>I embrace this opportunity to renew to your Excellency the assurances

                                through recent conversations held at Washington on behalf of the

                            <p>These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the
                                two governments which is that in respect to import, export and other
                                duties and charges affecting commerce as well as in respect to
                                transit, warehousing and other facilities and the treatment of
                                commercial travelers samples, the United States will accord to
                                Greece and Greece will accord to the United States, its territories
                                and possessions, unconditional most favored nation treatment, and
                                that in the matter of licensing or prohibitions of imports and
                                exports, each country, so far as it at any time maintains such a
                                system, shall accord to the commerce of the other treatment as
                                favorable, with respect to commodities, valuations and quantities,
                                as may be accorded to the commerce of any other country. It is

                                country; similarly, no higher or other duties shall be imposed in
                                the United States, its territories or possessions, or in Greece on

                            application of the new tariff until March 1st and added that the Greek

                            further indicates that in this interval the Greek Government proposed to
                            negotiate a provisional convention of a duration of six months to be
                            tacitly renewable on the basis of the new customs tariff, such temporary
                            convention to be eventually replaced by a treaty of commerce of long
                            duration as soon as Greek commercial policy is definitely fixed. It is
                            to such provisional convention that the Minister evidently referred in
                            conversation reported in Department’s 89, December 9, 4 p.m.<note n="25" xml:id="d227fn28">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It is Department’s understanding and desire, and it is suggested that you
                            confirm this understanding if possible, that the exchange of notes
                            recently effected, so far as the commercial relations between United
                            States and Greece are concerned, will take the place of any provisional
                            convention such as that mentioned above, since, for the reasons already
                            indicated, the early notification and ratification of a convention is
                            impracticable.</p>

                            that the American Government for its part is ready not to avail itself
                            of that right inasmuch as the British Government has already manifested

                        <p>In instructing me to ask your Excellency kindly to let me know your views
                            on this, the President of the Council, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
                            wishes me to draw your attention to the remarks formulated by the
                            Hellenic International Financial Commission, to which, under the
                            Protocol signed October 17th last, at Geneva,<note n="31" xml:id="d230fn31">The Minister in Switzerland in telegram no. 8,
                                Jan. 30 (file no. 868.51 Refugee Loan 1924/33), reported that the
                                protocol referred to was apparently that of Sept. 29, to which was
                                appended a declaration signed the same day on behalf of Great
                                Britain, France, and Italy, and published by the League of Nations

                            the service of the contemplated loan should be turned over.</p>
                        <p>The above named Commission first expressed a regret that there was not
                            inserted in the protocol of October 17th any clause providing sanctions
                            for failure on the part of the Greek Government to abide by the
                            provisions of the law creating the international control.</p>
                        <p>It further remarked that the guarantees to be delivered by the Hellenic
                            Government were fixed upon the mere declarations of that Government
                            without the Commission being enabled to find whether they would be
                            satisfactory. The members of the Commission believe that they could not
                            accept the trust under consideration except after examination of these
                            guarantees and with the reservation that in the case arising they could
                            call for more.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the French delegate to the Commission points out that it would,
                            in his opinion, be well as was done in preceding negotiations of the
                            same kind to bring about an understanding between the Financial
                            Commission and the Hellenic Minister of Finance before the final
                            conclusion of the loan for the refugees.</p>
                        <p>The President of the Council would wish to know whether the Government of
                            the United States would not hold as the French Government does, that it
                            is advisable to put as a condition on the possible assent of the three
                            powers to the Hellenic Government’s request that the last named
                            Government would take into account the above stated reservations and
                            remarks.</p>
                        <p>I should be thankful to your Excellency if you would kindly put me in a
                            position to report to my Government on this question at the earliest
                            possible date.</p>

                            receipt of Your Excellency’s communication of January 4, 1924 in which
                            you state that the Government of Greece has inquired of the French
                            Government whether it would be disposed, in order to promote the
                            conclusion of a loan and the establishment of the refugees in Greece, to
                            waive the right of veto provided by the so-called Tripartite Financial
                            Agreement of February 10, 1918. You indicate that in view of the
                            particular circumstances of the case the French Government is disposed
                            to act favorably upon such a request if it learns that the American
                            Government is for its part prepared not to avail itself of the right
                            conferred by Article 4, the British Government, you state, having
                            already manifested its intention to assume a similar attitude under the
                            same reservation.</p>
                        <p>The Greek representative in Washington on July 24, 1923 communicated with
                            the Department<note n="32" xml:id="d231fn32"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_356"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            the Government of the United States as contemplated in the Financial
                            Agreement of February 1918. In reply the Greek representative was
                            informed that this Government desired to see the exigency for work of
                            relief in the Near East properly met and that the question which he had
                            raised had received and would continue to receive most careful and
                            sympathetic consideration.<note n="33" xml:id="d231fn33">See

                            United States would not be disposed to offer any objection to the
                            pledging of security by Greece in connection with a loan at that time
                            for the purpose of dealing with the refugee situation, provided the
                            governments of Great Britain and France should likewise agree to raise
                            no objection.</p>
                        <p>I may add that the view of this Government in the matter, anxious as it
                            is to facilitate in any proper way the solution of the refugee problem
                            in Greece, has not undergone any change. This Government is, moreover,
                            of the opinion that any foreign loan <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0379"/>which may be floated by Greece under the present
                            circumstances could best be utilized for the purpose of the settlement
                            of the refugees. It would desire therefore to place no impediment in the
                            way of the Greek Government’s furnishing security for any credits that
                            may be obtained by Greece for such a purpose.</p>
                        <p>In the concluding paragraphs of the Embassy’s communication the
                            Department’s attention is directed to the observations of the Greek
                            International Financial Commission with regard to the Protocol of
                            October 17th<note n="36" xml:id="d231fn36">See footnote 31, <ref target="#pg_283">p. 283</ref>.</note> and the desirability of
                            sanctions in case of the failure of the Greek Government to meet the
                            dispositions of the law setting up an international control. While the
                            Department is not in possession of information on this point sufficient
                            to justify a detailed expression of opinion with regard to the
                            observations of the Commission, it is felt that the control which might
                            be exercised over the expenditure of any advances obtained by Greece for
                            the purposes of refugee relief is a matter which the agencies making the
                            advances to Greece would be most competent to determine.</p>

                            the contemplated Loan, to be granted, under the auspices of the League

                            refugees. In conformity with the financial agreement of February, 1918,
                            the Legation had asked, in this note, for the consent of the United
                            States necessary to Greece to pledge securities for this loan.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of October 9, 1924, with regard to the loan which,
                            it is indicated, your Government desires to arrange through the League
                            of Nations, for <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0381"/>the purpose of
                            making possible the completion of the work required for the settlement
                            of the refugees. You refer to the Legation’s previous communication of
                            July 24, 1923, in which, as contemplated in the Financial Agreement of
                            February 1918, inquiry was made whether the assent of the United States
                            Government would be given to the pledging of further security by Greece
                            for the purpose of raising the loan.</p>
                        <p>In its reply of August 7, 1923, the Department, as you point out, stated
                            that it was desirous of seeing the exigency as to the work of relief in
                            the Near East properly met and that the question raised in your letter
                            had received and would receive the most careful and sympathetic
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>In your communication of October 9, under acknowledgment, you raise
                            again, on behalf of your Government, the question of the consent of this
                            Government to the pledging by Greece of security which will make it
                            possible to raise the contemplated loan. You also enumerate certain
                            suggested modifications of the Protocol of Geneva of September 29, 1923,
                            relative to the loan. These modifications concern the guarantees to be
                            given by the Greek Government and provide that the total amount
                            authorized should be ten million pounds sterling.</p>
                        <p>I wish to point out in reply that the view of this Government as
                            indicated in the letter of August 7, 1923, referred to above, has not
                            undergone any change. The Department of State is in entire sympathy with
                            the object to which it is contemplated the proceeds of the loan will be
                            put. This Government will therefore place no impediment in the way of
                            the Greek Government’s furnishing security for the loan now contemplated
                            for the purpose of refugee relief.</p>
                        <p>It should be understood, however, that the consent which this Government
                            hereby gives relates only to the pledging of the security specifically
                            mentioned in the note of October 9 for the purpose of floating the
                            refugee relief loan which you have described. This Government should not
                            therefore be understood to have acquiesced in the view set forth in the
                            paragraph of your note, which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Greek Government retains the right to mortgage any surplus
                                    from the revenues or the surplus of revenues assigned to this
                                    loan, in excess of the amount necessary for its service. The
                                    Greek Government pledges itself not to mortgage other revenues,
                                    except those assigned to the refugees loan, without the advice
                                    of the International Financial Commission.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It should also be understood that the present consent by the Government
                            of the United States is given with full reservation of all questions
                            with respect to the agreement of February 1918.</p>

                            American bankers furnish information regarding loans that they may be
                            negotiating with foreign governments, we beg to submit the following
                            concerning the loan to the Greek Government, for participation in which
                            we are in negotiation:</p>
                        <p>The Greek Government proposes to issue $11,000,000 principal amount of
                            its Forty-Year 7% Secured Sinking Fund Gold Bonds, being part of an
                            International Loan known as the Refugee Loan of 1924, of an authorized
                            amount of approximately £12,500,000 (to yield the Greek Government, say,
                            £10,000,000). Of the Bonds constituting this loan, £7,500,000 principal
                            amount have been sold, through public subscription, in London by Hambros
                            Bank, Limited, and £2,500,000 principal amount are being offered in
                            Greece by a group of banks, headed by the National Bank of Greece. Of
                            the proposed Dollar issue, it is expected that $5,000,000 will be placed
                            in London and the balance in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this loan is to provide funds for the reestablishment in
                            Greece of Greeks who lived in Turkey and who, in accordance with the
                            Treaty of Peace with that country, are returned to Greece.</p>
                        <p>The entire loan will be issued under the auspices of the League of
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>We enclose a preliminary descriptive circular<note n="39" xml:id="d234fn39">Not printed.</note> and trust that the Department
                            will agree with us in believing that the participation of American
                            bankers and the American public in this loan will be in harmony with the
                            policy of our Government, to encourage our people to assist in the
                            rehabilitation of European countries.</p>
                        <p>We call your attention to the fact that the amount of the Dollar issue
                            has been increased to $11,000,000 principal amount from $10,000,000,
                            which was the amount in contemplation when our Mr. Millhauser
                            communicated with Dr. Young over the telephone yesterday.</p>

                            Government of Guatemala with reference to the treatment which the United
                            States shall accord to the commerce of Guatemala and which Guatemala
                            shall accord to the commerce of the United States.</p>
                        <p>These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two
                            Governments which is that, in respect to import, export and other duties

                            warehousing and other facilities, the United States will accord to
                            Guatemala and Guatemala will accord to the United States its territories
                            and possessions unconditional most-favored-nation treatment.</p>

                            bonds of the Haitian 5 percent Foreign Gold Loan of 1910.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that on May 12, the Secretary of State, replying to the
                            French Ambassador’s note of April 10, 1923,<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">French Ambassador’s note not printed. For text of the Secretary’s

                            reasons why, in the opinion of the American Government, the interest of
                            the loan should not be paid in gold coin or in paper francs in an amount
                            based on the current rate of exchange of the dollar, as claimed by the
                            Bank of the Parisian Union acting as the fiscal agent of the loan.</p>
                        <p>I beg to confirm to you that this Embassy has just received a
                            communication from the French Foreign Office informing us that the Bank
                            of the Parisian Union, not having been able to reach an agreement on the
                            subject with the Haitian Government, recently wrote a letter to the
                            Minister of Finance in Haiti requesting that the difference be submitted
                            to an arbitration.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of the French Government that bonds-holders cannot be
                            deprived from asking for that legal way of settling the difference with
                            the Haitian Government and that, consequently, they approve of the
                            request made by the Bank of the Parisian Union.</p>

                            the receipt of your letter of January 4, 1924, informing me that the
                            Bank of the Parisian Union has requested that the question of the
                            redemption of the Haitian loan of 1910 in gold coin should be submitted
                            to arbitration. I have noted your statement that the French Government
                            approves of the request made by the Bank of the Parisian Union.</p>
                        <p>I may say for your information that the Department has already had
                            occasion to consider the question whether the Bank of the Parisian Union
                            might properly demand an arbitration of the question of the payment of
                            the 1910 bonds under the provisions of the loan contract.<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">Text of loan contract printed in <hi rend="italic">Le Moniteur</hi>, Oct. 26, 1910, p. 608.</note> It has
                            expressed to the Haitian Government its opinion that the holders of the
                            bonds of the 1910 loan, since they are presumably not parties to the
                            contract, would not be in a position to request arbitration of the
                            question whether the outstanding bonds should be redeemed in gold or
                            paper francs, and that it would not seem that the Fiscal Agent under the
                            1910 contract could properly advance a claim for arbitration on behalf
                            of the bondholders. It would seem that the Fiscal Agent’s function in
                            paying the bonds as agent of the Haitian Government is a purely
                            ministerial one. The Fiscal Agent Would not appear to have any right to
                            raise an objection to the mandate which might be received from the
                            Government in the matter, or to do otherwise than to apply for the
                            purpose specified any funds which it might receive.</p>

                            of 1910, which is now effected in paper, and did not share the opinion
                            of the Bank of the Union Parisienne, according to which the sums
                            appropriate for such payments must be paid in gold francs.</p>

                        <p>My Government, to which a copy of the above-mentioned note from Your
                            Excellency was forwarded, instructed the Embassy some time in January
                            last to inform the State Department that under those conditions the Bank
                            of the Union Parisienne asked to have the difference which had arisen
                            between the French bondholders and the Haitian Government referred to
                            arbitration in accordance with the positive provisions of article 30 of
                            the contract for the issue of the loan, and that the French Government
                            approved such a proceeding.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of the Division having the matter in charge in the Department
                            of State, with whom the matter was broached in that sense, answered that
                            the question whether under the terms of the loan contract the said bank
                            would be justified in asking arbitration had been looked into previously
                            and that the American Government had expressed to the Haitian Government
                            the opinion that the holders of the bonds of that loan, not being a
                            party to the contract, were not competent to resort to such
                            proceeding.</p>
                        <p>Since then my Government has heard that the Government at Port-au-Prince
                            had not failed, after consulting with the American Financial Adviser, to
                            reject the request for arbitration and declare that its rejection of the
                            request of the French bondholders was final.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with instructions just received on the subject, I have the
                            honor to inform Your Excellency that the Government of the Republic
                            finds it impossible to accept the refusal of Haiti. There is no question
                            indeed that a contract was entered into by Haiti and the Bank of the
                            Union Parisienne and that the contract expressly provides for
                            arbitration as a means to adjust “disputes that might arise concerning
                            its execution.” Whether the claims of the bondholders to the amount to
                            be paid in gold are well- or ill-founded is not the question now at
                            stake. The arbitrators are to pass upon that point. It is merely a
                            question of procedure which is clearly regulated by the contract signed
                            by the Haitian Government and the execution of which it could not evade
                            in law or equity. It is further proper to note that the Bank of the
                            Union Parisienne does not act in the case as the institution in charge
                            of the financial service of the loan but in its capacity as the bank
                            which issued the 1910 loan and is therefore responsible to the
                            bondholders for the conditions of payment.</p>
                        <p>My Government, therefore, holding that the intervention of the Bank of
                            the Union Parisienne is fully warranted, instructs me once more to
                            intervene with Your Excellency in order to have the question reexamined
                            with a view to a mode of settlement, which the French interested parties
                            have surely a right to expect and which has never been held to be in
                            disfavor with the American authorities. My Government would be very glad
                            to hear that, taking into consideration <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0390"/>the foregoing remarks, Your Excellency will be pleased
                            to direct that new instructions be sent to the American Financial
                            Adviser at Port-au-Prince.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased [etc.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: In a letter dated June
                            12 last, and afterward in a conversation he had with Your Excellency on
                            the 30th of the same month, the Ambassador called your attention to the
                            difficulties raised by the Haitian Government on the question of the
                            payment of interest and amortization of the gold loan of 1910 of
                            Haiti.</p>
                        <p>As is known to Your Excellency the Government at Port-au-Prince disputes
                            the right claimed by the Bank of the Union Parisienne to refer to
                            arbitration the question of the service of the said loan in gold. By a
                            note dated July 10, 1924, the Secretary of State for Foreign Relations
                            of Haiti notified the Minister at Port-au-Prince that such a proceeding
                            could only be considered in the relations between the Government of
                            Haiti and the three banks that were parties to the said contract. The
                            bondholders not being parties to the contract could not under the theory
                            upheld by the Haitian Government be allowed to present in their own name
                            any claim on the point of the redemption of the securities in gold or
                            paper francs. The Secretary of State added that he cannot admit that the
                            Union Parisienne is qualified to lay before the Haitian Government any
                            claim whatsoever in the name of the French bondholders, as the 1910
                            contract concerning the relations between the said bank and the State of
                            Haiti for the service of the loan does not confer upon the bank any such
                            rights. In its capacity of agent of the Haitian Government, so ends the
                            communication, the Union Parisienne is under the obligation to act for
                            the interest of the Republic of Haiti and not that of the
                            bondholders.</p>
                        <p>After reading the communication above summed up, the President of the
                            Council, Minister of Foreign Affairs, advised the Minister of France at
                            Port-au-Prince that he could not in any way concur in the views of the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs of Haiti as the argument followed by him
                            seemed to be without juridical foundation.</p>
                        <p>Indeed the Haitian Government’s main argument comes to this: The
                            borrowers of the 1910 loan, not being parties to the loan contract,
                            “cannot be allowed to lay before the Haitian Government in their <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0391"/>own behalf any claim on the
                            point as to whether the securities must be redeemed in gold or paper
                            francs.” This is a purely gratuitous assertion, to the support of which
                            there is brought no legal consideration of any kind, and furthermore, it
                            rests on a misapprehension which the Government of the Republic wishes
                            to dispel.</p>
                        <p>It is any creditor’s natural and obvious right to be allowed to look to
                            his debtor when he believes his interests are injured on the strength of
                            the very text of the instrument which constitutes the debt, that is to
                            say, in this case, on the wording of the bond. Leaving aside the
                            contract of loan to which they were not a party and by which they cannot
                            in any way be bound, the bondholders are therefore in no way powerless
                            to claim from their debtor the execution of engagements entered into by
                            the said debtor. They always have at their command, since an action at
                            law cannot be brought against a sovereign state, the facility of
                            applying to their Government, which is qualified to vindicate their
                            rights by all means placed at its disposal by the law of nations.</p>
                        <p>But in this case this question does not arise. The bondholders indeed are
                            not concerned in the case for the present. The dispute is merely between
                            the borrowing Government and one of the banks of issue, bound to each
                            other by a contract entered into on August 29, 1910.<note n="6" xml:id="d241fn6">The loan contract, authorized by the Council of the
                                Secretaries of State on Aug. 29, 1910, was signed Sept. 5,
                                1910.</note> In the exercise of the right conferred upon it by
                            article 30 of that contract, the Union Parisienne asks that the question
                            of service of the loan in gold be referred to arbitration. In the letter
                            which it addressed on this subject to the Minister of Finance of Haiti,
                            it specified that it acted “in its capacity as bank of issue” and
                            therefore as party to the contract. The Haitian Government has therefore
                            no ground on which it can assert that the bank is acting “on behalf of
                            the holders” and on that account deny it the right to intervene. The
                            Union Parisienne claims a right which is positively conferred upon it by
                            the contract of issue. The fact that this intervention happens to
                            subserve at the same time the interests of the Union Parisienne and that
                            of the bondholders is one that cannot make any difference as to the
                            rights in the question. That action is absolutely independent of any
                            recourse which in common law the bondholder may have against his
                            debtor.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Haiti, on the other hand, declares
                            that “in its capacity as agent of the Haitian Government, the Union
                            Parisienne is under the obligation to act in the interests of the
                            Republic of Haiti and not in that of the lenders”.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing in the contract of issue to support that pretension. The
                            banks of issue, of which the Union Parisienne is one, under-took <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0392"/>(article 24) to “buy outright”
                            130,000 five-hundred-franc bonds. By way of compensation for that
                            undertaking, the banks of issue reserved to themselves certain
                            advantages. For instance, under article 13, the Union Parisienne has
                            charge of the service of the loan for the consideration of a fixed
                            commission of ¼ percent of the sums needed for the service. The contract
                            determines the rights and obligations of each party in connection with
                            one special operation, the issue of the loan, but goes no further. The
                            above-mentioned commission, which is customary in such cases, does not
                            place the Union Parisienne under any obligation to the Haitian
                            Government of a general nature that would not be expressly provided by
                            the contract.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Camille Léon’s argument would further lead to the unacceptable
                            conclusion that article 30 (providing for arbitration) could never be
                            invoked by the Union Parisienne and would exist for the benefit of the
                            Haitian Government alone.</p>
                        <p>In directing me to lay before Your Excellency the foregoing remarks, my
                            Government instructs me to inform you of the great value which would
                            attach to having the Government of the United States intervene so as to
                            induce the Haitian Government to desist from its refusal to let the Bank
                            of the Union Parisienne avail itself of the right which lawfully results
                            from the contract signed by the two parties on August 29, 1910.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            Embassy’s notes of June 12, 1924 and September 5, 1924, discussing in
                            detail your Government’s views with regard to the request of the Bank of
                            the Parisian Union that the question of redeeming in gold rather than in
                            francs the bonds issued by the Republic of Haiti in 1910 be submitted to
                            arbitration. The considerations which you present have received the most
                            careful study in the Department of State.</p>
                        <p>This Government had hitherto understood that the Bank of the Parisian
                            Union had requested arbitration in this matter on behalf of certain
                            holders of the bonds of 1910. As you have already been informally
                            advised, this Government has expressed the opinion that the holders of
                            the bonds of 1910, since they were presumably not parties to the loan
                            contract, would not be in a position to demand arbitration under the
                            provisions of Article 30 of that contract, and that the Fiscal Agent
                            under the contract could not properly advance <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0393"/>a claim for arbitration on their
                            behalf. This Government has also expressed the opinion that the Fiscal
                            Agent would not appear to have any right to raise an objection to the
                            mandate which might be received from the Haitian Government in the
                            matter of redeeming bonds upon presentation, or to do otherwise than to
                            apply for the purpose specified any funds which it might receive.</p>
                        <p>It is realized, however, that a new question would be presented for
                            consideration if the Bank of the Parisian Union on its own account
                            should present a demand for arbitration under the provisions of Article
                            30 of the loan contract. It appears from your communications above
                            referred to that the Bank has now presented such a demand in its
                            capacity as purchaser and distributor of the 1910 loan. In order that
                            the question thus presented may receive appropriate consideration,
                            therefore, I have caused copies of your notes of June 12 and September 5
                            to be transmitted to the American Legation at Port au Prince, with
                            instructions to discuss the matter with the Financial Adviser and other
                            appropriate officials of the Haitian Government, and to report his views
                            thereon at his early convenience.</p>

                        <p>14. Due to a three-cornered revolution in Honduras the situation there is
                            chaotic and there appears no hope of a solution within the near future.
                            Revolutionists are besieging Tegucigalpa and it has been necessary to
                            send a landing force to protect American Minister and American colony.
                            No faction appears able to dominate the situation and a condition of
                            anarchy seems likely to develop.</p>
                        <p>Under these conditions the Department finds it necessary to ask you to
                            proceed at once to Tegucigalpa to report what steps should be taken to
                            bring about a solution which will prevent further bloodshed and
                            destruction of property. Guatemala, Salvador and Nicaragua have
                            discussed offering joint mediation but their efforts in this direction
                            have so far been fruitless because of failure to agree among themselves
                            on plan. Department has expressed sympathy with their efforts but
                            desires to be in a position to offer assistance whether these efforts
                            result in holding a conference or not. Consequently it desires that you
                            should be in Tegucigalpa or Amapala to assist at conference if that
                            should be held, or possibly to offer direct mediation of the United
                            States. Further instructions will be sent you by wireless.</p>
                        <p>A destroyer is being ordered to proceed to Santo Domingo at once from
                            Guantanamo to take you to Honduras. Please proceed as soon after her
                            arrival as is physically possible.</p>

                        <p>1. Supplementing the Department’s cable of April 8, 6 p.m., the following
                            is sent for your information:</p>
                        <p>In the elections in Honduras last October none of the three candidates,
                            Carias, Arias and Bonilla, received a majority and the Congress also
                            failed to select a President, because of obstructive maneuvers by the
                            various factions. When the President’s term expired on February 1 Lopez
                            Gutierrez established a dictatorship as a provisional measure. This
                            Government proposed that changes in the cabinet should be made to make
                            possible the holding of new elections which would be free and fair.
                            Lopez Gutierrez agreed to this but failed to make satisfactory changes,
                            and Carias refused to accept the Department’s proposal and started a
                            revolution. The United States therefore announced that it did not
                            recognize any government in Honduras and would continue to conduct
                            necessary business informally.</p>
                        <p>Recently the generals controlling the several revolutionary armies, the
                            most important of whom are Tosta, Ferrera and Carias, agreed to proclaim
                            Fausto Davila as provisional President. This group now controls the
                            entire north coast and the greater part of the Republic and has been
                            besieging Tegucigalpa for four weeks without success. Lopez Gutierrez
                            died of illness on March 10 and the Council of Ministers, headed by
                            Zuniga Huete, succeeded to his authority in Tegucigalpa. Very recently
                            Dionisio Gutierrez is reported to have started another revolutionary
                            movement on behalf of Bonilla in southern Honduras. The President made
                            unlawful the shipment of arms and munitions of war to Honduras by a
                            proclamation dated March 22.<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_322">p.
                                322</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Since the end of February Guatemala, Salvador and Nicaragua have been
                            making efforts to agree on a plan for joint mediation, but these efforts
                            have failed apparently because of inability to agree upon a place for
                            holding the conference. The Department expressed its sympathy with the
                            plan, and upon being invited to send a representative indicated that it
                            would do so if invited by all three participants. The Department has
                            little hope that the three countries can agree between themselves upon
                            any plan for joint action. The President of Salvador has stated that he
                            has abandoned the plan, and Nicaragua has asked the United States to
                            take independent action.</p>
                        <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0396"/>
                        <p>The American Minister at Tegucigalpa is being informed of your
                            approaching arrival and is being instructed, unless he deems it
                            inadvisable or impracticable, to inform the leaders of all factions that
                            a representative of this Government is being sent with special
                            instructions to offer the friendly assistance of the United States in
                            finding a solution which will bring about the establishment of peace in
                            Honduras, and to propose an armistice for ten days.</p>
                        <p>The Department is endeavoring to arrange for transportation by airplane
                            from the north coast of Honduras to Tegucigalpa. If such arrangements
                            can not be made you will be informed by wireless and the ship will be
                            diverted to Panama.</p>

                        <p>2. Supplementing Department’s April 9, 4 p.m. The Department desires that
                            you should proceed at once to Tegucigalpa and ascertain what steps can
                            most profitably be taken to establish peace. You may exercise your
                            friendly offices on behalf of this Government alone if that step seems
                            advisable to save time and avoid other difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Department has today received the following telegram dated April 9
                            from the American Minister at Guatemala: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The President of Guatemala told me today that mediation in
                                    Honduras is a duty, that the United States should participate,
                                    that he prefers participation by all republics bordering on
                                    Honduras but that if either believes that moment is not
                                    opportune then Guatemala would be happy to act in conjunction
                                    with the United States. Repeated Salvador and Nicaragua.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Department has replied as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Department earnestly desires to be of assistance in
                                    establishing peace in Honduras, and the Honorable Sumner Welles
                                    is being sent as the President’s special representative to offer
                                    friendly offices for this purpose. You may inform President
                                    Orellana of this fact and say that while this Government has
                                    received most sympathetically President Orellana’s suggestion it
                                    would prefer to postpone any decision upon a definite course of
                                    action until it receives a report from Mr. Welles, who will
                                    reach Puerto Cortes on April 12. Welles is being instructed to
                                    recommend whether it would be better, in order to avoid loss of
                                    time and other difficulties, for this Government to act alone in
                                    exercising its friendly offices, or whether it would be
                                    preferable that the Central American countries should
                                    participate in a joint offer of friendly offices. If he decides
                                    upon the latter course he will communicate with the Department,
                                    and the <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0397"/>Department, if
                                    it concurs, will authorize you to extend to the Government of
                                    Guatemala an invitation to act with the United States”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>If you consider it preferable that the Central American countries should
                            participate in any effort of friendly offices, you will at once inform
                            the Department, which will instruct the Legations at Managua, San
                            Salvador and Guatemala, to cooperate with you and to extend an
                            invitation for joint action with this Government. It does not appear
                            necessary to include Costa Rica, which has shown little interest in
                            proposals for friendly offices. The Department fears, however, that any
                            effort at joint action with the Central American countries would result
                            in loss of time, and would possibly create complications due to the fact
                            that Guatemala is thought to sympathize with the Arias faction, and
                            Nicaragua with the Carias faction. On the other hand, the Department
                            desires to show a courteous regard for the Central American Governments
                            and particularly for the Government of Guatemala which has been very
                            active in trying to find means to compose Honduran difficulties.
                            Furthermore, you may find that your efforts would be more successful if
                            seconded by the Central American neighbors of Honduras. It leaves this
                            matter to your judgment.</p>
                        <p>There are two American warships in the Gulf of Fonseca, one of which
                            could be used for the purpose of holding a conference on neutral ground
                            if desired. You are authorized to offer one of the warships for this
                            purpose if you find it advisable.</p>
                        <p>The Department must also leave to you the character of the solution to be
                            proposed, but it desires that you should bear in mind the importance of
                            bringing about the eventual establishment of a Government in Honduras
                            which can properly be recognized by the United States. In a public

                            solution would be either (1) the election of a constitutional President
                            by the existing Congress, if that can be arranged, or (2) the
                            establishment of a provisional government of such a character as to give
                            assurance that new elections could be held under conditions of freedom
                            and fairness. The Department, however, will not make recognition by this
                            Government conditional upon any particular solution so long as the <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0398"/>new administration could be
                            defended as constitutionally established and fairly representative of
                            the will of the people. It would, in fact, be prepared to give an
                            appropriate indication of its sympathy and moral support to any
                            provisional government which gave satisfactory evidence of an intention
                            to reestablish constitutional order.</p>
                        <p>Please keep the Department fully informed of all steps taken. The
                            Department desires that you should work in close cooperation with
                            Minister Morales, who has conducted the affairs of the Legation
                            satisfactorily under exceedingly trying and difficult conditions. Mr.
                            Morales has been informed that the Department is sending you to
                            Honduras, not because of any lack of confidence in him, but because it
                            seems necessary to have two properly qualified representatives of this
                            Government on the ground, so that Mr. Morales himself may remain in
                            Tegucigalpa to protect American lives and property there, and because
                            the Department realizes that his perfectly proper compliance with the
                            Department’s instructions has possibly created enmities toward him
                            personally which would make more difficult any efforts on his part at
                            mediation.</p>
                        <p>The President has designated you as his personal representative.</p>

                        <p>Department’s April 9, 4 p.m. It appears to me highly desirable that
                            action by the United States in suggesting a peaceful solution of the
                            present situation in Honduras be taken jointly with all the other
                            Central American States. Such a course would not only avoid present
                            suspicion and prevent future misunderstanding, but would also be
                            entirely in keeping with our policy as made manifest in the Central
                            American Conference.</p>
                        <p>I am not clear from the Department’s cable under reference whether the
                            Government of Costa Rica has been approached in this matter or why the
                            initiative in suggesting the holding of a conference to consider joint
                            action has not been taken by the United States rather than by the three
                            Republics mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Unless the Department has objections of which I am not advised to the
                            pursuit of such a course, I beg to suggest the advisability of cabling
                            urgent instructions to the American Ministers in the other four Central
                            American countries to request the Governments to which they are
                            accredited to send representatives at once to Amapala to consider the
                            steps which should be taken jointly by the United States <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0399"/>and the Central American countries to
                            end the present state of anarchy in Honduras.</p>
                        <p>Such a conference in addition to being in harmony with the purposes of
                            the Central American Conference, would be a practical demonstration of
                            the intention of the President of the United States and the Central
                            American States to ensure the maintenance of peace and the safeguarding
                            of orderly government by constitutional methods in Central America.</p>

                        <p>3. I arrived at the radio station in the outskirts of Tegucigalpa an hour
                            ago. The American Minister advises me by radio he cannot leave the city
                            to meet me until tomorrow “for lack of sufficient guarantees.” I cannot
                            consequently have an interview with those in control of the dictatorship
                            today as I intended.</p>
                        <p>On my way through the revolutionary lines I had a long conference with
                            Generals Carias and Tosta, the only two of the revolutionary leaders now
                            near the Capital. I explained to them fully the purpose of the mission.
                            I discussed with them in detail the bases of an agreement providing for
                            an immediate cessation of hostilities and for the government of the
                            country until new elections can be held and a constitutional government
                            be installed. I was favorably impressed with their attitude. I
                            determined to refrain from proposing an armistice until some definite
                            agreement in principle has been reached between the contending factions,
                            after which an armistice can be proclaimed to continue until such time
                            as the agreement takes definite shape. Upon two previous occasions when
                            an armistice was declared the revolutionary forces were attacked and it
                            appears to be unwise to suggest utilization of one except with the
                            certainty that an agreement will be reached.</p>
                        <p>I proceeded here overland from Puerto Cortes. The civil war has left the
                            country utterly destitute. The north coast and the interior and all
                            communications are in the control of the revolution. The situation
                            wherever I passed appeared quiet, order being maintained by patrols,
                            duty being undertaken by volunteers.</p>
                        <p>I beg to request as soon as possible a reply to my cable April 11, 10
                            a.m., since my negotiations here will be in large part determined by the
                            Department’s decision.</p>

                        <p>4. Your April 14, 4 p.m. Department did not reply to your April 11, 10
                            a.m., because it assumed that you had subsequently received Department’s
                            April 10, 6 p.m., and that you would communicate fully your views
                            regarding advisability of Central American conference after your arrival
                            in Tegucigalpa. In view of possible difficulties attending Central
                            American effort at mediation the Department would prefer to have an
                            expression of your considered views after discussing situation with
                            leaders of all factions and with American Minister. If thereafter you
                            still feel that joint action of Central American republics is advisable
                            Department will extend suitable invitation upon the receipt of your
                            recommendation. It desires, however, that you should carefully consider
                            the possible objections to such action as set forth in Department’s
                            April 10, 6 p.m. The Department would not wish to lose reasonable
                            opportunity to bring about immediate termination of hostilities by
                            waiting for convening of Central American Conference which would entail
                            considerable delay and might inject partisan influences into the
                            deliberations.</p>

                        <p>5. My April 14, 4 p.m. I entered Tegucigalpa with the American Minister
                            yesterday. Immediately thereafter a conference was held between the
                            Minister and myself and the Ministers of the Dictatorship. I proposed to
                            them the bases of a settlement which had been previously agreed upon by
                            the chiefs of the revolution and myself. These bases comprised: <list>

                                <item>The selection of a Provisional President by the leaders of

                                    leaders of the revolution. The citizens proposed for this office
                                    by the revolutionary leaders are in the aggregate honest and
                                    efficient.</item>

                        <p>The members of the Council of Ministers demonstrated with the exception
                            of the Ministers of War and Finance the utmost unwillingness to enter
                            into any agreement except one which provided for complete equality of
                            treatment as between, the two contending factions. They likewise refused
                            to accept the sole mediation of the United States, insisting that any
                            agreement must be reached at Amapala with the additional mediation of
                            delegates of the Central American Republics. In conclusion they refused
                            to agree to the immediate reaching of an agreement but insisted that the
                            negotiations must take place at Amapala.</p>
                        <p>After a very long discussion a compromise suggestion was framed providing

                            approximately the bases presented by the leaders of the revolution, both
                            parties subsequently to send delegates to a conference at Amapala at
                            which representatives of the United States and the Central American
                            Republics would be present, where a definite agreement based upon the
                            preliminary pact could be effected.</p>
                        <p>This morning delegates of the Council of Ministers accompanied the
                            American Minister and myself to the radio station where the chiefs of
                            the revolution were waiting. I had thereupon a conference apart with the
                            chiefs of the revolution to explain to them the changes which had been
                            made in their proposals. They were at first entirely unwilling to
                            consider the proposals of the Council of Ministers but finally consented
                            to all save the proposal to postpone the selection of the Provisional
                            President until the conference at Amapala could be held on the ground
                            that the object sought by the dictatorship was the indefinite prolonging
                            of negotiations, pending which it hoped a movement of reaction could be
                            promoted against the revolution with assistance from adjacent countries,
                            upon which negotiations would be broken off by the dictatorship and that
                            revolution would lose all the advantages acquired during the past
                            months. They therefore demanded agreement upon the Provisional President
                            prior to the holding of any conference at Amapala as a sign of good
                            faith on the part of the dictatorship.</p>

                        <p>When the Department takes into consideration that with the capture of
                            Choluteca yesterday the revolutionary leaders control the entire
                            Republic except the Capital, have now all the arms and ammunition
                            necessary as well as all the funds needed to besiege the Capital
                            indefinitely, whereas the dictatorship has a scant seven or eight
                            hundred troops in the Capital and no apparent means of paying them, the
                            attitude of the leaders of the revolution appear[s] conciliatory. I have
                            impressed upon them the fact that satisfactory elections cannot be held
                            here under a provisional government controlled only by one party. It was
                            for this reason that they agreed to permit the Provisional President to
                            give representation to all factions in his government.</p>
                        <p>It is the intention of the Minister and myself to communicate the
                            decision of the revolutionary chiefs to the Council of Ministers tonight
                            and urge acceptance to avoid inevitable capture of the Capital with
                            consequent loss of life and destruction of property.</p>
                        <p>Department’s April 15, 3 p.m. The Department’s cable of April 10, 6 p.m.
                            was only received by me yesterday and in such condition that it could
                            not be deciphered. Repetition has been requested.</p>

                            Minister and myself and the members of the Council of Ministers the
                            following solution was yesterday definitely accepted by them: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>As soon as this written proposal was signed by the Council of Ministers I
                            called a meeting of the chiefs of the revolution, who had <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0403"/>the afternoon previous signified their
                            willingness to agree to the solution proposed. The meeting was attended
                            by Generals Carias, Tosta and Martinez Funes. All indicated their
                            approval but refused to sign the written proposal until the agreement of
                            General Ferrera, the remaining leader, now absent in San Lorenzo, was
                            obtained. I am today certain General Ferrera is in accord with the
                            solution above referred to except that he insists upon the selection of
                            Dr. Fausto Davila as Provisional President and will not agree to the
                            selection of a Provisional President from list of names presented by all
                            the delegates present at the initial conference suggested. I have fixed
                            the next meeting with the chiefs of the revolution for tomorrow
                            afternoon when General Ferrera will be able to attend. I shall then
                            advise him as I have already advised the three other chiefs that in the
                            opinion of the Government of the United States a provisional government
                            presided over by the titular head of one of the political parties, as is
                            Dr. Davila, and entirely controlled by one of the political parties,
                            cannot guarantee the holding of fair elections in which the adherents of
                            all candidates would have equal rights; that it is for that reason that
                            I have proposed the selection of the Provisional President from a list
                            of names determined upon by the delegates of both factions and
                            representatives of all parties in the Cabinet of the Provisional
                            President.</p>
                        <p>In view of the urgency of the situation here, it has appeared best to
                            hasten the suspension of hostilities by proposing the selection of the
                            Provisional President and the signing of a preliminary pact on an
                            American warship in Amapala with the sole mediation of the United
                            States. I have, however, favored the additional mediation of the Central
                            American republics in the negotiation of the final agreement since in my
                            opinion Central American participation in the solution of the problem
                            will be of great value. Central American mediation in the negotiation of
                            the final agreement … will attach [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the
                            criticism that the coming government was placed in power by the United
                            States. Furthermore, while I [am?] informed [by?] the Minister that the
                            better class of Honduraneans welcomed the entrance of American marines
                            into the Capital and believed it justifiable and necessary as I myself
                            understand it to guarantee [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] from all
                            information at my disposal, the measure has undoubtedly caused bitter
                            protests among certain elements in the Republic which will certainly be
                            subsequently disrepute [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] throughout Latin
                            America. For this reason in particular I believe it desirable that our
                            responsibility in effecting a satisfactory and equitable settlement of
                            the present difficulties in this Republic be shared by all the countries
                            represented in the last Central American conference. This opinion is
                            concurred in by the American Minister.</p>

                        <p>I shall advise the Department by cable immediately should General
                            Ferrera’s approval be obtained to the agreement proposed, in order that
                            the Department may cause the necessary invitations to be extended to the

                            signed also by the four leaders of the revolution including General

                            has arranged for a meeting on board the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Milwaukee</hi> of the chiefs of all Honduran factions. The object
                            of this meeting is to come to an arrangement whereby hostilities will be
                            suspended and a subsequent settlement of present difficulties made
                            through a joint mediation. The representatives of all the other Central
                            American countries, and of the United States, will be invited to
                            participate. You will add that the United States is pleased to
                            participate in this joint mediation and will be represented by Sumner
                            Welles. It trusts that Guatemala will also appoint one or more
                            representatives to take part, and hopes that those representatives will
                            come to Amapala as soon as possible. The Department hopes that the

                                    Nicaragua and Salvador have agreed to participate in the
                                    proposed conference. The Nicaraguan delegate, Dr. Jose Andres
                                    Urtecho, is expected in Amapala April 26 or 27. The delegate of
                                    Salvador will be Señor Martinez Suarez. In view of the urgent
                                    necessity that the conference should meet at the earliest
                                    possible moment, you will urge the President of Guatemala to
                                    send a delegate as soon as possible, in order that the
                                    conference may meet as soon as the delegates at least from the

                                        printed.</note> The Department considers it advisable that
                                    the conference should meet at Amapala, because delegates of both
                                    factions in Honduras can reach there more rapidly than they can
                                    reach Guatemala, and because it has been clearly evident from
                                    previous negotiations that it would be difficult for the
                                    Governments of the other Central American countries to agree to
                                    hold the conference in the capital of one of the other
                                    countries. The Department does not understand that the
                                    conference will necessarily meet on one of the American
                                    warships, but this point, together with other questions
                                    involved, is left to the discretion of Mr. Welles.”</p>

                                <p>“The Governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua and Salvador have agreed
                                    to participate in the proposed conference, and the two latter
                                    have named delegates. The Nicaraguan delegate is expected in
                                    Amapala April 26 or 27. In view of the urgency of bringing about
                                    an agreement which will stop bloodshed and put an end to the
                                    horrible condition now existing in Tegucigalpa, the Department
                                    hopes that the conference may meet at a very early date and that
                                    the Costa Rican Government may be represented.</p>
                                <p>If there is no commercial steamer available for transportation of
                                    Costa Rican delegate the Department will endeavor to have
                                    American war vessel carry the delegate to Amapala. It does not,
                                    of course, wish to do this unless necessary and you will,
                                    therefore, not suggest it if any other transportation is
                                    immediately available. Since the arrival of the Costa Rican
                                    delegate may be delayed it may seem advisable to start
                                    discussions as soon as the delegates from the other three
                                    countries arrive, but it is hoped that every effort will be made
                                    to expedite the acceptance of Costa Rica and the appointment of
                                    a delegate.”</p>

                        <p>14. At 10 o’clock this morning the delegates at the preliminary
                            conference unanimously elected General Vincente Tosta Provisional
                            President and signed the preliminary peace convention of which the
                            following is the literal translation.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows the text of the preliminary agreement. For final text of

                            the revolution were entering the Capital having now, from advices
                            received from the American Minister, complete control. The victory of
                            the revolution does not in my opinion affect the validity of the
                            agreement reached, signed as it is by the fully authorized delegates of
                            both factions. Moreover the carrying out of this agreement will prevent
                            long-drawn-out counterproposals, for the majority of the dictatorship
                            troops have escaped from the Capital; it will avert a break between
                            Carias and Ferrera which otherwise appears imminent; it will permit the
                            neighboring Republics through their representatives at the final
                            conference to declare their moral support of this Provisional
                            Government; and most important of all it will assure the Department that
                            the Provisional Government will be one to which can be accorded
                            immediate moral support since it will be presided over by General Tosta
                            who has no political antecedents nor ambitions, who remained loyal to
                            the last constitutional government and only headed a revolution after
                            the dictatorship was installed, and who is a man of sufficient energy
                            and integrity to maintain order and to guarantee the holding of free
                            elections. Equally important is the fact the Provisional Government
                            constituted in accordance with this agreement will be installed by the
                            vote of delegates representing all the political parties in Honduras and
                            that all political parties will be represented in the Cabinet. I beg to
                            request the Department’s approval of the steps taken and of the policy
                            indicated above. I also request immediate authorization to state that a

                        <p>19. My number 18, May 1, 9 a.m.<note n="8" xml:id="d259fn8">Not
                                printed.</note> The first session of the conference took place this
                            morning. The discussion was limited to a consideration of the articles
                            of the preliminary agreement between the two factions in Honduras signed
                            in Amapala on April 28th. It is my belief that the formal and definite
                            arrangement between the two parties will be concluded in the second
                            session which will take place this afternoon. All the Central American
                            delegates are in entire accord with the provisions contained in the
                            preliminary agreement.</p>
                        <p>I had last night an informal conference with the Central American
                            delegates. I suggested that the conference undertake to make two formal
                            declarations binding upon the nations represented: (1) <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0410"/>that the Governments here represented
                            declare their entire neutrality and impartiality as between the various
                            political parties in Honduras and obligate themselves during the life of
                            the Provisional Government not to favor any political party or candidate
                            in the coming national elections by the exertion of influence or by the
                            use of any other means; (2) that the conference declare that the
                            Governments represented believe in the efficacy of the treaties and
                            conventions signed as a result of the last Central American Conference
                            as means of preserving peace, of favoring government by constitutional
                            and orderly methods and as conducive to the development of general
                            prosperity in Central America. That this declaration should likewise
                            contain the expression of the hope that the signatory Governments would
                            bring about the speedy ratification of these instruments.</p>
                        <p>The delegate from Nicaragua proposed the negotiation of a convention
                            providing for the appointment of a standing commission of mediation in
                            which all the nations here represented would participate through
                            delegations to provide for joint mediation in all cases similar to that
                            recently existing in Honduras. It is my opinion that the negotiation of
                            such a convention might with advantage be postponed until the next
                            government. I beg to request the Department’s instructions on this
                            point.</p>

                        <p>20. The final form of equitable definite agreement between the two
                            factions in Honduras was formally approved by all the delegates at this
                            morning’s session of the conference. The definite agreement closely
                            follows the form of the preliminary pact, the only changes of importance
                            being the adoption of my suggestions providing for substitution of the
                            Provisional President in case of death or resignation and for a more
                            definite wording of article III of the preliminary pact incorporationg
                            the provision that in the case of the removal of any Cabinet minister,
                            he must be replaced by a member of the same political group. The
                            definite agreement will be signed tomorrow in Amapala and not on the <hi rend="italic">Milwaukee.</hi></p>

                        <p>22. The final session took place this morning in Amapala. The formal
                            convention in the form indicated in my number 20 of May 2, 3 p.m., was
                            signed by the representatives of both political factions in Honduras and

                            Costa Rica signed a formal declaration of which the following is a

                                    of Honduras in reestablishing completely peace and public

                                    placed in power by the free vote of the people of Honduras.</p>
                                <p>It is a pleasant duty for the delegates at the same time to
                                    evidence in this final declaration the expression of their
                                    gratitude to the personal representative of the President of the
                                    United States, chairman of this conference, for the perfect
                                    tact, entire rectitude and impartiality and breadth of vision
                                    which he has contributed in the successful carrying out of his

                                <p>And since in the attainment of these purposes it has not been
                                    possible to employ the means provided in the international
                                    comity agreements now awaiting the ratification of certain of

                                    emergency occur in the future similar to that which recently
                                    took place in Honduras, steps to reestablishment immediately
                                    constitutional government may more easily and rapidly be
                                    taken.”</p>

                            simultaneously with the United States, to a provisional government of

                            Honduras has placed an order with them for twenty-six thousand dollars
                            worth of rifles and ammunition. The Company inquired whether it could
                            make delivery of these rifles and ammunition to the representative of
                            the revolutionary forces at shipside, New Orleans, or could make
                            shipment direct to Honduras. It is impossible to stop the shipment of

                            issued a proclamation forbidding the exportation of arms or munitions of

                            of Congress approved January 31, 1922. As this proclamation made no
                            provision for permitting the shipment of arms for commercial purposes,
                            or for other shipments which it might prove advisable to allow to
                            proceed, I wish to suggest that a supplementary proclamation be issued
                            prescribing as an exception to the provisions of the joint resolution
                            above referred to such arms and munitions of war as may from time to
                            time be exported with the consent of this Department. I am transmitting

                        <p>The program made by the League of Nations for the financial
                            reconstruction of Hungary expresses the necessity that the priority of
                            the international loan to be granted to Hungary must be assured over all
                            of Hungary’s assets and against all existing encumbrances. The Hungarian
                            Government has therefore been invited to take appropriate steps to
                            assure this end as regards governments which hold relief bonds against
                            the Hungarian Government.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of previous conversations on this subject, I take the
                            liberty therefore to express the request of my Government that the
                            Government of the United States be good enough to suspend during the
                            period of amortization of the reconstruction loan to be given to
                            Hungary, viz, twenty years, the priority provisions of the relief bonds
                            held by the American Government against Hungary.</p>
                        <p>My Government has instructed me in particular to assure the American
                            Government that in making this request it does not mean in any way to
                            ask the Government of the United States to yield the privileged position
                            of relief bond holders with respect to priority over reparation
                            payments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Chargé d’affaires</hi>: In reply to the
                                <hi rend="italic">Aide Memoire</hi> handed to me on January 3rd by
                            Count Széchényi and containing the request of the Hungarian Government
                            that the Government of the United States suspend during the twenty-year
                            period of amortization of the proposed reconstruction loan for Hungary,
                            the priority <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0420"/>enjoyed by the
                            Hungarian Relief Bond held by this Government, I desire to inform you
                            that, while this Government, as in the case of Austria, would be ready
                            to give sympathetic consideration to any appropriate plan for the
                            financial rehabilitation of Hungary, it will be necessary to receive
                            certain additional information and assurances before proceeding further
                            in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I have noted your Government’s statement that in making this request it
                            does not mean in any way to ask the Government of the United States to
                            yield the privileged position of relief bond holders with respect to
                            priority over reparation payments. It appears, however, that the
                            proposed plan for the Hungarian Reconstruction Loan contemplates annual
                            reparations payments by Hungary amounting to not more than ten million
                            gold crowns and commencing after the year 1926, such payments to be made
                            from revenues not specifically assigned to the service of the loan. Were
                            such a plan put into operation and were the holders of Hungarian Relief
                            Bonds to waive the priority enjoyed by such bonds for the full term of
                            the reconstruction loan, it would appear that reparation payments would
                            in fact be accorded a priority over relief bond obligations. This
                            Government could not assent to such an arrangement and would not waive
                            in favor of the proposed reconstruction loan the priority enjoyed by the
                            relief bond which it holds, unless satisfied that its relief bond would
                            at all times be entitled to priority over reparation payments in
                            accordance with the original agreement under which relief advances were
                            made to Hungary.</p>
                        <p>In this same connection permit me to call to your attention the
                            assurances given in Mr. Daruváry’s Note of November 14, 1923,<note n="1" xml:id="d270fn1">Not printed.</note> to the American Minister at
                            Budapest with reference to the “error in connection with the interest
                            due on the United States Relief Bond” to the effect that the Hungarian
                            Government would inform the Finance Committee of the League of Nations
                            that the proportion of back interest due the United States on its relief
                            bond must be made a first charge against the proceeds of any foreign
                            loan contemplated under the League of Nations’ plan. No information has
                            reached this Department that the proposed League of Nations’ plan has
                            made definite provision for the payment of this back interest. This
                            Government feels, therefore, that it should be assured that this action
                            which would place it on a basis of equality with other holders of
                            Hungarian relief obligations has been taken and that the charge referred
                            to has been created.</p>
                        <p>I should also be grateful if you would find it possible to inform me
                            whether any special arrangements with other nations in respect of debts
                            owed to private individuals or state claims arising out of <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0421"/>the Treaty of Trianon have been made by
                            Hungary and if so, whether they would in effect cause such creditors to
                            receive payments from the Hungarian Government to the prejudice of the
                            priority enjoyed by the terms of the relief bond held by this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I might add for your information that this Government could in no case
                            consider the waiver desired unless substantially all other creditor
                            nations of Hungary having a lien upon either the assets or revenues of
                            Hungary should take similar action with respect to their claims.
                            Moreover, the period of the waiver could extend only to a date mutually
                            agreed upon by substantially all the other creditor nations or until the
                            date of repayment by Hungary of the proposed reconstruction loan,
                            whichever date should be the earlier.</p>

                        <p>My Government has authorized me to enter into negotiations with the end
                            in view to bring about a debt funding agreement between the United
                            States and Hungary, following substantially the lines of the one
                            concluded between the United States and Finland.<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">For text of the agreement with Finland, see <hi rend="italic">Combined Annual Reports of the World War Foreign

                                Office, 1927), p. 120.</note></p>
                        <p>The conclusion of such debt funding agreement with the United States
                            would necessitate, of course, the negotiating of corresponding
                            agreements on the part of Hungary with other governments holding relief
                            bonds.</p>
                        <p>While my Government stresses the desirability of proceeding with the
                            drafting of the proposed American-Hungarian agreement with the utmost
                            dispatch, it emphasizes the fact that any debt funding agreement with
                            the United States would prove truly valuable for Hungary only in such
                            case as with the conclusion of the agreement in question the United
                            States Government were willing to return its relief bonds, waiving
                            thereby the legal priority assured to same at present.</p>
                        <p>The Hungarian Government feels all the more confident that the United
                            States will be willing to adopt such a course, since the Reparation
                            Commission at its meeting held on February 21, 1924, has explicitly
                            recognized the priority of payments on relief bonds as against
                            reparations.</p>
                        <p>Concerning reparations to be paid by Hungary, my Government begs to point
                            out that all payments <hi rend="italic">en charge du traite de paix</hi>
                            <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0422"/>would depend on the discretion
                            of the Commissioner General, inasmuch as such payments are to be made
                            only and in so far as the Commissioner General would deem it compatible
                            with Hungary’s capacity to pay and as not endangering the stability of
                            Hungary’s budget and finances.</p>
                        <p>The Hungarian Government trusts therefore that the American Government
                            will see its way clear to yield the present legal priority of its relief
                            bonds in favor of the proposed international loan to Hungary, as the
                            actual priority of payments on relief bonds over reparations is already
                            assured.</p>

                                Hungarian relief bond and subordination of its priority in favor of
                                reconstruction loan. Am advised that Hungarians are now in London
                                negotiating for loan and that Governor of Bank of England is now
                                favorable thereto. Nothing in the nature of actual contracts can be
                                consummated with the banking interests until the status of the
                                American relief bond is ascertained. For this reason am requested
                                ask you whether Congress has yet taken necessary action as required
                                by article 12 of pending agreement dated April 25, 1924. I am asked
                                to urge you employ every proper effort to cause action to be
                                speedily taken. It is thought that negotiations will be completed

                                reparations which that enjoys. Anticipate that commission at next
                                meeting will take this action to be effective providing Congress has

                                existing priority. Am informally advised that Hungary has already
                                been informed by all countries except France that they are willing
                                to subordinate their relief bond priority in favor of reconstruction

                                formal letter will be forthcoming this week. Have recommended that
                                certified copies of original letters from the various powers
                                addressed to Hungary be immediately despatched to Washington for the

                                might follow formula adopted by most other powers, namely, providing

                                <p>“1—Immediately after the United States Supreme Court’s decision
                                    regarding the alien landownership dispute was made known, the
                                    Imperial Government took steps to call the serious attention of
                                    the United States to its grave consequences<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">See memorandum of Dec. 4, 1923, from the

                                    and is now awaiting a reply from that Government.</p>
                                <p>2—The time is still premature for disclosing full details of the
                                    steps taken.</p>
                                <p>3—The Japanese agriculturists in America are bestowing their best
                                    consideration on the steps to be taken to save the situation. In
                                    view of this fact, the Government intends to wait and see the
                                    result of their deliberations, while causing the Japanese
                                    Consulates in the affected districts to give such help as is
                                    deemed appropriate.</p>
                                <p>4—All circumstances must be fully considered in deciding the
                                    propriety or otherwise of revising the Japanese-American treaty
                                    of commerce and navigation in force, and the Government is not
                                    yet in a position to state whether to revise it or not.</p>
                                <p>5—For the above-mentioned reason, the Government has not yet
                                    approached the United States Government on the matter, but it is
                                    now studying the problem.</p>

                                <p>6—The Government recognises the need for enabling those who have

                                    in those foreign countries to forsake Japanese nationality even

                                    promulgated in 1910 after due revision and the matter is now
                                    being studied.”</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador at his interview with the Honorable the Secretary
                            of State on December 13th, 1923, took occasion to call the Secretary’s
                            attention to certain provisions of the bill which was introduced in the
                            House of Representatives on December 5, 1923, by Mr. Johnson of
                            Washington, entitled “A Bill to limit the immigration of aliens into the
                            United States, and to provide a system of selection in connection
                            therewith, and for other purposes,” in their relations to the existing
                            commercial treaty between Japan and the United States and to certain
                            understandings of the two Governments. A similar measure is before the
                            Senate also, which was introduced in that body on December 6, 1923 by
                            Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts.</p>
                        <p>In the bill there is, among other provisions, one which excludes from
                            admissible classes aliens not eligible to United States citizenship
                            (Sec. 12, <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, H. R. 101).</p>
                        <p>By the decision of the United States Supreme Court of November 13, 1922
                            in the case <hi rend="italic">Takao Ozawa</hi> vs. <hi rend="italic">the
                                United States</hi>,<note n="4" xml:id="d277fn4">260 U. S.
                                178.</note> noneligibility of Japanese nationals to United States
                            citizenship is determined.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the provision above-referred to is to be permitted to remain
                            in the measure when it becomes a law, it means an open declaration on
                            the part of the United States, that Japanese nationals as such, no
                            matter what their individual merits may be, are <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0429"/>inadmissible into the United States,
                            while other alien nationals are admissible on certain individual
                            qualifications equally applicable to them all. It is not easy to
                            understand that this would not be an arbitrary and unjust discrimination
                            reflecting upon the character of the people of a nation, which is
                            entitled to every respect and consideration of the civilized world. Nor
                            does it seem to harmonize with the well-known principles of America’s
                            foreign policy, which stands for international justice and is opposed to
                            discriminations against American nationals.</p>
                        <p>It may be recalled that in concluding the so-called “Gentleman’s
                            Agreement” of 1907, which involved no small sacrifices on the part of
                            the Japanese Government, and in making the Declaration of February 21,

                            and the United States, the sole desire of the Japanese Government was to
                            relieve the United States Government from the painful embarrassment of
                            giving offence to the just national pride of a friendly nation, which is
                            ever so earnest and has spared no effort in preserving the friendship of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>In agreeing to the terms of the so-called Gentleman’s Agreement, which
                            were arranged in deference to the suggestions and wishes of the United
                            States Government, and in concluding the Commercial Treaty of 1911, one
                            important object of which for Japan was, it will be remembered, to avoid
                            such discriminatory legislation as that now under consideration, the
                            American Government showed that it fully understood and appreciated the
                            Japanese opposition to any form of discrimination against Japanese
                            people as such, and virtually assured the Japanese Government that, in
                            return for these sacrifices, made in order to preserve the self-respect
                            of their nation, the United States Government will see to it that there
                            shall be no discriminatory legislation on the part of the United States
                            against Japanese people as such.</p>
                        <p>For instance in the note of February 25, 1911,<note n="7" xml:id="d277fn7">Not printed.</note> informing the Japanese
                            Ambassador at Washington of the ratification of the Treaty of Commerce
                            and Navigation between the United States and Japan, the Secretary of
                            State stated in part as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    ratification, that the Treaty shall not be deemed to repeal or
                                    affect any of the provisions of the Act of Congress entitled “An
                                    Act to regulate the Immigration of Aliens into the United
                                    States”, approved February 20, 1907.’<note n="8" xml:id="d277fn8">34 Stat. 898.</note></p>

                                    Government will have any objection to the understanding being
                                    recorded in the instrument of ratification.”</p>

                        <p>The meaning of the last paragraph above quoted seems to require no
                            elucidation.</p>
                        <p>To speak frankly, the mere fact, that such a provision is introduced in
                            the proposed measure, in apparent disregard of these most friendly and
                            effective endeavors on the part of the Japanese Government to meet the
                            needs and wishes of the American Government and people, is mortifying
                            enough to the Government and people of Japan. They are however
                            exercising the utmost forbearance at this moment, and in so doing they
                            confidently rely upon the high sense of justice and fair-play of the
                            American Government and people, which, if properly approached, will
                            readily understand why no such discriminatory provision as
                            above-referred to should be allowed to become a part of the law of the
                            land.</p>
                        <p>It is needless to add that it is not the intention of the Japanese
                            Government to question the sovereign right of any country to regulate
                            immigration to its own territories. Nor is it their desire to send their
                            nationals to the countries where they are not wanted. On the contrary
                            the Japanese Government showed from the very beginning of this problem
                            their perfect willingness to cooperate with the United States Government
                            to effectively prevent by all honorable means the entrance into the
                            United States of such Japanese nationals as are not desired by the
                            United States, and have given ample evidences thereof, the facts of
                            which are well-known to the United States Government. To Japan the
                            question is not one of expediency, but of principle. To her the mere
                            fact that a few hundreds or thousands of her nationals will or will not
                            be admitted into the domains of other countries is immaterial, so long
                            as no question of national susceptibilities is involved. The important
                            question is whether Japan as a nation is or is not entitled to the
                            proper respect and consideration of other nations. In other words the
                            Japanese Government ask of the United States Government simply for that
                            proper consideration ordinarily given by one nation to the self respect
                            of another, which after all forms the basis of amicable international
                            intercourse throughout the civilized world.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned begs to request, under instructions from His Majesty’s
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Secretary of State will be good
                            enough to give his early and sympathetic consideration to the matter as
                            above presented. Further the undersigned ventures to hope that the
                            memorandum which he had the honor of handing <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0431"/>the Secretary of State on December 4, 1923,<note n="9" xml:id="d277fn9"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_460"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 460</ref>.</note> may be considered in
                            connection with the present one, for while they relate to two distinct
                            matters, in their essence both representations may be applied with equal
                            cogency to the one as to the other.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Immigration</hi>.—The Ambassador said that he was
                            not at all excited in consequence of the report made by the Committee on
                            Immigration of the House of Representatives<note n="10" xml:id="d278fn10">H. Rept. 350, 68th Cong., 1st sess., committed to
                                the Committee of the Whole House, Mar. 24, 1924.</note> as he
                            understood that the Bill had not yet been passed, but that it was his
                            duty to inform his Government as to every stage in the progress of the
                            measure and his Government did not understand the situation as well as
                            he did and would be likely to be somewhat aroused by the statements
                            contained in the report. He called attention to what was said in the
                            report on pages 7 and 8, that the Department of Labor had stated that it
                            was not in possession of the Gentlemen’s Agreement and other references
                            in the report, criticizing the action of Japan in relation to the
                            Agreement. He also pointed out the statement on page 9 of the report
                            that Japan was excluding the Chinese and Koreans and discriminating
                            thereby against people of her own color. The Ambassador said that these
                            statements were not accurate. He said that there was no such
                            discrimination as was charged.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he felt there were two points in connection with
                            the report of the Committee upon the Gentlemen’s Agreement that
                            disturbed him. The one was the statement that it was a secret Agreement
                            the terms of which had not been disclosed. The Secretary said that it
                            was necessary to meet this point, but the so-called Gentlemen’s
                            Agreement was contained in long correspondence and it would not be
                            satisfactory merely to produce the correspondence. Further, the
                            Secretary said that he did not like the suggestion that the Agreement
                            had not been effective for the purpose to which it was applied. The
                            Secretary felt that some rejoinder should be made to these statements.
                            It was difficult for him, however, to make an adequate rejoinder for the
                            reason that in the first place the disclosure of a voluminous
                            correspondence would only give opportunities for further discussion and
                            that so far as the action of Japan was concerned under the <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0432"/>Agreement it would be appropriate that
                            Japan should make that statement for herself.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had an idea,—he did not wish to make a
                            definite proposal,—that possibly the Ambassador could write a letter to
                            the Secretary referring to these points in the report and stating that
                            the Gentlemen’s Agreement was contained in a considerable
                            correspondence, but that the Japanese Government understood its intent
                            and effect to be as stated. Then the Agreement could be summarized in a
                            brief and definite fashion and could be presented authoritatively.
                            Similarly, Japan could state the course that she had taken under the
                            Agreement in the actual control of emigration to the United States. It
                            might be possible also in such a letter for the Ambassador to correct
                            the statement to which he had referred with respect to the point of
                            discrimination against Chinese in her own case. That might be a matter
                            for further consideration, but it occurred to the Secretary that there
                            was an opportunity to take the Gentlemen’s Agreement out of obscurity
                            and of voluminous correspondence and put the matter in a direct and
                            simple form. The Secretary said he would be glad to collaborate with the
                            Ambassador in dealing with the matter in this way, if the Ambassador
                            thought the suggestion could be followed up.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated his interest in the suggestion and seemed
                            inclined to favor it, but said he would have to communicate with his
                            Government, of course, before he could attempt it. The Secretary
                            suggested that before the Ambassador communicated with his Government it
                            might be well for the Ambassador to think the matter over and have
                            another talk with the Secretary for the purpose of considering more
                            definitely what such a communication should contain, so that the
                            Ambassador could present a concrete suggestion to his Government which
                            would not be misunderstood. The Ambassador said that he would give the
                            matter further thought.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Government feels that there has been some misunderstanding

                            to be omitted against fraud. (3) [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>] But such
                            Government is not willing to print on the passport a warning against
                            improper use thereof or even to print such warning on a separate slip of
                            paper to be attached to the passport. Said Government is ready, however,
                            to give instructions under which persons to whom passports are granted
                            will be warned in clear and unmistakable terms, orally, at the time the

                            representations and fraudulent use of passports. (4)</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government does not question the utility of a rule

                            principle, were and still are averse to adding to the obligations
                            already incumbent on such Japanese subjects another obligation which
                            might under easily supposable circumstances work unmerited hardship. At
                            the same time they fully realize the value of frank and harmonic [<hi rend="italic">harmonious</hi>] cooperation by the officials of the
                            respective Governments in this as well as in all other matters connected
                            with emigration, not only as one of the most effective means of
                            preventing fraud, but also as the strongest safeguard of the rights of
                            those mistakenly accused of it. … While no effort will be spared to make
                            the registration as complete as possible, the Imperial Government will
                            not consider that the absence of registration constitutes a reason for
                            the forfeiture of residential rights.” (5)</p>

                                    <p>“In a communication to the Embassy on February 23, the
                                        Imperial Japanese Government expressed confident belief that
                                        their settled policy of not issuing passports good for the
                                        mainland of the United States, to Japanese and Korean
                                        laborers, complemented by the amendment and the Executive
                                        Order of last March, would work satisfactorily and make
                                        further measures unnecessary. It was further stated that if
                                        this belief were not realized, the Imperial Japanese
                                        Government would be prepared to consider with the United

                                    <p>Official statistics, the gist of which has already been
                                        communicated, prove conclusively that the existing
                                        arrangements have been quite futile in their utter failure
                                        to prevent, in accordance with the policy of the two
                                        Governments, the increase of the number of Japanese laborers
                                        arriving in the United States, and of Japanese who have left
                                        Japan as non-laborers but have become laborers after
                                        entering this country.</p>
                                    <p>It is evident, therefore, that the moment contemplated in the

                                    <p>Understanding, however, that the Imperial Japanese Government
                                        is averse at this time to making the matter of immigration
                                        the subject of further conventional agreement, although
                                        discouraged by the complete failure of the administrative
                                        measures hitherto taken, still, in deference to the attitude
                                        of the Japanese Government and believing that there is no
                                        real divergence of policy in the premises, this Government
                                        invites Japan to join in fresh efforts adequately to meet
                                        the situation by frank and cordial cooperation expressed in
                                        really effective administrative measures, which alone, if
                                        promptly adopted and strictly enforced, may make the
                                        alternative, legislation by Congress, unnecessary.”</p>

                            <p>Although the Imperial Government, as has already been explained,
                                cannot enter into any fresh conventional agreement regarding the
                                emigration of Japanese laborers to the United States, they are
                                willing to meet the situation to which their attention has been
                                called by the American Ambassador by frank and cordial cooperation
                                with a view to the adoption of more effective administrative
                                measures. <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0442"/>They are not
                                prepared to admit without qualification, however, that the
                                administrative measures at present enforced by both Governments to
                                prevent the emigration of Japanese laborers to the American mainland
                                have been so complete a failure as the communications of the
                                Ambassador would seem to indicate. Their belief is that the partial
                                failure of those measures to secure the results hoped and expected
                                has been due to causes which, for the sake of convenience, may be
                                divided into two categories, first, those which are of a temporary
                                nature; and, second, those which, with the experience gained, can be
                                eliminated by the adoption of more stringent precautions
                                hereafter.</p>
                            <p>In the first category may be included the migration of laborers from
                                the Hawaiian Islands to the United States by the way of British
                                Columbia, and from Mexico to adjacent American territory. The
                                Imperial Government are confident that it can be shown to the
                                satisfaction of the American Government that this movement was of an
                                entirely temporary nature, which was unanticipated at the time the
                                present administrative measures were adopted, but the continuation
                                of which under new arrangements now in contemplation and soon to be
                                adopted will be practically impossible.</p>
                            <p>The second category has reference to Japanese subjects claiming to
                                belong to the commercial and student classes to whom passports to
                                the American mainland have been given. It is true that it has come
                                to the knowledge of the Japanese Government that in certain cases of
                                this kind persons not entitled to the privilege, that is to say,
                                laborers in the guise of merchants or students, have obtained
                                passports. But in justice to the officials charged with the duty of
                                issuing such passports it should be pointed out that in the
                                beginning the enforcement of administrative measures necessitating a
                                great deal of careful investigation rendered some mistakes both
                                natural and inevitable. The just conclusion is that these mistakes
                                were due to inexperience and most emphatically not to wilful
                                dereliction of duty on the part of the officials concerned. The
                                Imperial Government are of opinion that with the experience already
                                gained the observance of their strict instructions in the premises
                                would be assured and causes for complaint reduced to a minimum, even
                                under existing circumstances. But in order to set at rest all
                                possible doubt upon the subject they are prepared to adopt
                                additional precautionary measures which will be explained in due
                                course.</p>
                            <p>It seems appropriate in this connection to draw attention to the fact
                                that the number of Japanese laborers alleged to have entered the
                                United States in violation of existing administrative measures
                                appears to be exaggerated. It is not meant by this to impugn the
                                motives of the officials responsible for these statements,
                                presumably the Bureau of Immigration, but Japanese official
                                statistics clearly <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0443"/>show
                                that the figures given are too high. In some cases they appear to be
                                estimates merely, and aside from the specific cases of violation
                                which are comparatively few in number, there is nothing to show that
                                the other immigrants referred to, even admitting the numbers given
                                to be correct, should properly be included in the prescribed class.
                                The Imperial Government have no desire, however, to take advantage
                                of mistakes of this kind, or to cite them as a reason for nonaction.
                                They quite agree that the situation calls for some effective remedy
                                in the interests of both countries. They call attention to this
                                phase of the subject because they feel sure the American Government
                                will agree with them that overstatements of this nature, even when
                                unintentional and made in complete good faith, can have no other
                                effect than to further complicate the delicate and difficult
                                situation which confronts the two Governments.</p>
                            <p>The following comments have reference to matters referred to in the
                                memorandum enclosed with the American Ambassador’s note of November

                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Hawaiian Islands</hi></p>
                            <p>The immigration of Japanese laborers to the Islands of Hawaii has
                                hitherto been regulated in accordance with the labor conditions
                                actually prevailing in those islands. The Planters Association from
                                time to time informs the Japanese Consul-General of the actual
                                condition of labor on the various plantations, and, the latter
                                communicates to the Japanese Government the estimated number of
                                laborers who may be needed. In response the Japanese Government
                                grants passports and permits only up to the limit of such number.
                                Even in this case they have from other considerations reduced the
                                number in many instances to one half or even one third of that
                                suggested by the Consul-General. These steps, being in accord with
                                the economic law of supply and demand, have generally speaking
                                proved successful. It is a matter of common knowledge that American
                                labor never has been, and is not now employed in the sugar industry,
                                the predominant industry of the Islands and consequently the
                                argument advanced in His Excellency the American Ambassador’s
                                despatch dated November 16th, last,<note n="23" xml:id="d279fn23">Not printed.</note> based upon the so called ruinous
                                competition of labor can hardly apply so far as labor conditions
                                there are concerned.</p>
                            <p>From these and other considerations based upon fundamental
                                differences existing between the Hawaiian Islands and the mainland
                                of the United States, economically, geographically and historically,
                                the Japanese Government earnestly desire that <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0444"/>the territory of the Hawaiian
                                Islands be set outside the scope of the present discussion. It is by
                                no means their intention however to insist upon the permanent
                                continuation of the present system for those islands. On the
                                contrary they will be prepared to take into careful consideration
                                any special condition which makes it desirable to take certain
                                measures with a view to regulate Japanese immigration into such
                                islands. Their only desire is that the question concerning the
                                Hawaiian Islands be separated from the question under
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Section I</hi></p>
                            <p>There appears to be some misunderstanding of the Japanese system of
                                passports on the part of the American authorities which an
                                explanation of the processes pursued may clear away. All passports
                                issue originally from the Foreign Office. They are not signed by the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs, but bear the seal of his office.
                                Passports for intending emigrants are sent as required to the
                                Governors of the various prefectures. Such passports are
                                consecutively numbered and a list is kept of all which are issued.
                                At regular intervals reports are required from prefectural offices,
                                all passports issued must therein be accounted for and every
                                passport not used must be returned. Upon the arrival of the emigrant
                                at the port of embarkation he is again examined by the local
                                authorities on land and shipboard. If everything is found to be in
                                order his passport is <hi rend="italic">viséd</hi>, the date of his
                                departure being stamped upon the document with a perforating stamp.
                                These various examinations, verifications and other precautionary
                                measures may, however, be taken if it is found upon examination that
                                they are practically applicable.</p>
                            <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Section II</hi></p>
                            <p>The Japanese Government are determined to continue their announced
                                policy of issuing no passports good for the mainland of the United
                                States for either skilled or unskilled Japanese laborers except
                                those who have previously resided in the United States, and the
                                parents, wives and children of Japanese resident in America. It is
                                understood, moreover, that it is their intention to continue to
                                grant passports to settled agriculturists, i. e. farmers owning or
                                having an interest or share in the produce of crops of agricultural
                                lands under the same measure of control as was explained to Mr.
                                O’Brien’s predecessor on May 26th last. As for the latter part of
                                Section II, i. e. the proposal to decline to issue such passports to
                                all such as it is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] likely to become
                                laborers on entering the United States, the Japanese Government have
                                decided and have already instructed the <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0445"/>local authorities to make the strictest and most
                                minute investigation in each case of application for a passport by
                                students or merchants or persons belonging to other classes than
                                laborers. They are confident that under administrative measures
                                amended and strengthened as suggested by the experience already
                                gained, and through the strict observance of precise instructions
                                issued in accordance therewith, the occurrence of cases of fraud
                                from this source will be rendered extremely improbable.</p>

                                context of the passports issued by the Japanese Government consist
                                of an expression of the desire that the bearers, subjects of His
                                Majesty the Emperor of Japan, shall be accorded proper protection in
                                the foreign countries through which they may pass or where they may
                                stay. This is a general right guaranteed to Japanese subjects by
                                existing treaty stipulations. It is a right upon which all
                                Governments are wont to insist as regards their subjects or citizens
                                abroad even where the latter are accused of violations of the law.
                                The domestic control and restriction of emigration are purely
                                administrative functions, and confer no power on the Japanese
                                Government to agree in advance that the evasion of such control, and
                                restriction at home, or the violation of similar laws or regulations
                                abroad, shall deprive the defender [<hi rend="italic">offender?</hi>] <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> of the protection
                                guaranteed to him by treaty.</p>

                                <item>The Japanese Consulate-General in New York has seventeen
                                    states and one district within its Consular district; the
                                    Consulate at Chicago has twenty states and one district; the
                                    Consulate-General at San Francisco has four states and two
                                    districts, while the Consulate at Seattle has six states in its
                                    district. Most of these states and districts extend over several
                                    hundred miles, and Japanese residents in the United States, more
                                    than one hundred thousand in number, are scattered over these
                                    great areas. The Japanese Consuls can have no exact knowledge as
                                    to the whereabouts of these Japanese residents or means of
                                    communicating with them all. The result will be that with the
                                    suggested system of registry most, if not all, of these
                                    residents will find themselves after one year from January 1,
                                    1908, unqualified to remain legaily <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0446"/>in the United States and may be dealt with
                                    accordingly, without the least fault on their part.</item>

                                <item>In order to compel a steamship company to carry back, without

                                    may have acted in contravention of any regulations, possibly it
                                    may be months or years after the alleged offense is said to have
                                    occurred, legislation will be necessary. The Japanese Government
                                    can entertain no hope that such legislation, if submitted to the
                                    Diet, will receive its approval.</item>

                                <item>The suggestions made by the American Government under sections
                                    V and VI would appear therefore wholly impracticable if not
                                    entirely impossible, to say nothing of the indignity and
                                    humiliation to which Japanese residents in the United States
                                    would be liable at any moment. The Japanese Government are
                                    afraid moreover that if those Japanese who have entered the
                                    United States and are peacefully earning their livelihood were
                                    to be subjected to the same rigorous measures of personal
                                    examination, and vexatious identification as on the occasion of
                                    entry an almost intolerable amount of injustice and humiliation
                                    would be inflicted upon Japanese residents other than laborers.
                                    A number of unfortunate instances in the past where Japanese
                                    gentlemen and sometimes even members of the Embassy have been
                                    the victims of wholly unwarrantable treatment at the hands of
                                    the American immigration officials justifies this apprehension
                                    on the part of the Japanese Government. It is therefore highly
                                    desirable that any rigorous measures of restriction or control
                                    over Japanese immigration to the United States shall stop with
                                    the landing of the passenger, relying upon the effective
                                    administration of the precautionary measures adopted by the
                                    Japanese Government to prevent the occurrence of fraud.</item>

                            <p>The personal conference which took place at the Foreign Office on the
                                30th instant having placed His Excellency the American Ambassador in
                                possession of the views of the Imperial Government upon the question
                                of Japanese emigration to the United States, and having, it is
                                hoped, demonstrated to His Excellency their earnest wish to arrive
                                at a mutually satisfactory understanding, the moment <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0447"/>seems opportune for more detailed
                                comment upon the Ambassador’s communications relating to the subject
                                than was possible upon that occasion, as well as for a formal
                                statement of the measures which the Imperial Government are prepared
                                to adopt in order effectively to meet the situation.</p>
                            <p>It affords Count Hayashi sincere pleasure to express at the outset
                                his appreciation of the genuinely friendly and conciliatory spirit
                                which is so conspicuously present in the Ambassador’s official and
                                personal utterances regarding this subject. The importance His
                                Excellency naturally attaches to the reasons which prompt the
                                American Government to desire the removal of what is deemed to be a
                                possible cause of grave economic embarrassment has manifestly not
                                led him to lose sight of the countervailing difficulties with which
                                the Imperial Government have to contend. Fully realizing as they do
                                the weighty character of the considerations which influence the
                                opinions of the American Government, the Imperial Government are
                                gratified to perceive in the views expressed by the Ambassador on
                                behalf of his Government reciprocal recognition of the delicate and
                                difficult nature of the problem which confronts Japan. Count Hayashi
                                is confident that he does not err in believing that this mutual
                                acknowledgment of the difficulties to be overcome on both sides will
                                aid materially in reaching a satisfactory settlement of the matters
                                at issue.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi has noted with interest the Ambassador’s remarks in the
                                letter of November 16th<note n="25" xml:id="d279fn25">Not
                                    printed.</note> concerning several of the collateral issues
                                connected with the question under consideration, and craves
                                indulgence for some allusion thereto. For example, as regards the
                                San Francisco school question, the attitude of the Imperial
                                Government may be briefly summed up in the statement that they had
                                no desire to secure special or unusual privileges for children of
                                Japanese parentage, but only the privileges voluntarily and without
                                question generally accorded to other children of alien parentage.
                                Those privileges they were convinced were assured to them by the
                                letter and spirit of the Treaty, and while it was far from their
                                intention to raise any question, which either on account of the
                                relations existing between the Federal and State and Municipal
                                Governments in the United States, or because of the condition of
                                affairs then prevailing at San Francisco, could prove a source of
                                embarrassment to the Government at Washington, they adopted the only
                                course which appeared to be open to them and to be justified by
                                precedent. The Ambassador is apparently inclined to the belief that
                                this incident has an important bearing upon the agitation regarding
                                Japanese immigration. To that view there is no objection to be urged
                                if the incident is regarded as a phase merely of that agitation, but
                                not, if <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0448"/>it is to be
                                considered as a cause thereof. Unfortunately the agitation hostile
                                to Japanese immigration, and in fact to Japanese interests
                                generally, had been set on foot and had gained considerable headway
                                at San Francisco and elsewhere in California long before the school
                                question was raised. Happily then, as always, the Imperial
                                Government found the Federal Government prompt and active in
                                applying measures of relief dictated by the traditional American
                                policy of justice and right dealing, and the incident was duly
                                closed. It is alluded to here somewhat at length, not because of its
                                intrinsic importance, but for the purpose merely of emphasizing its
                                symptomatic character, and on account, moreover, of the Ambassador’s
                                remarks concerning alien attendance in Japanese schools, in
                                particular those in Formosa. It should be explained that in the
                                latter case the practice followed, so far from being an example of
                                discrimination, was adopted entirely out of consideration for the
                                wishes of Chinese parents. Chinese children may attend the Japanese
                                schools if the parents so desire, but the majority of the latter
                                prefer education according to Chinese methods, and accordingly the
                                two systems are maintained side by side. The schools of the Empire
                                itself are open to all aliens and the large number of foreign
                                students in attendance in public institutions of learning bears
                                witness to the liberality with which this privilege is accorded.</p>
                            <p>The phase of the subject which the Ambassador aptly describes as
                                vastly more far reaching and difficult than the foregoing, namely,
                                the question of labor conditions in America is one of such purely
                                domestic concern that any expression of opinion on Count Hayashi’s
                                part, no matter how innocently intended, might seem out of place.
                                The Imperial Government recognize as a matter of course the right of
                                the American Government to regulate such matters in the manner best
                                calculated to promote American interests. They are confident,
                                however, that the Government at Washington, while acting upon this
                                principle, will deal with the situation to which the Ambassador
                                refers in the same liberal and enlightened spirit which has been
                                such a marked characteristic of American intercourse with Japan.
                                Whether that situation is sporadic rather than general; and whether,
                                so far as Japan is concerned, it demands a special remedy which,
                                even though it has technical sanction, cannot fail to be regarded as
                                detracting from the parity of intercourse so essential to the
                                genuine cordiality of international relations, are matters
                                concerning which Count Hayashi would prefer to express no opinion.
                                It is sufficient for the purpose which both Governments have in view
                                to assure the Ambassador that the Imperial Government, appreciating
                                the manifest intention of his communications and of the views of his
                                Government as explained therein, are desirous by frank and cordial
                                cooperation to reach an understanding which will eliminate all the
                                difficulties of the present situation.</p>

                            <p>Count Hayashi has already had the honor personally to explain to the
                                Ambassador several of the other matters touched upon in his
                                communication. For the sake of the record the salient features of
                                those explanations may be briefly recapitulated. The most important
                                point had reference to the belief evidently entertained by the
                                American authorities that existing administrative regulations have
                                proved inadequate for the regulation of the influx of Japanese
                                laborers to the American mainland. As Count Hayashi stated, the
                                Imperial Government are not prepared to admit without qualification
                                that this view is entirely correct. They believe that the partial
                                failure of the measures in question to accomplish the results hoped
                                and expected has been due partly to causes of a temporary nature,
                                the recurrence of which will be rendered extremely improbable in the
                                future; and partly to causes which the measures which they are
                                willing to adopt will wholly remove.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi also drew the Ambassador’s attention to what appeared
                                to him to be some inaccuracy in the figures reported by the American
                                immigration authorities. To illustrate, it is stated that the number
                                of Japanese coming to the United States, instead of decreasing, has
                                largely increased—12,407 having arrived during the last twelve
                                months, as against 6,454 during the preceding year, and that the
                                number of laborers coming in has increased, 1,858 Japanese laborers
                                having passports for the continental territory of the United States
                                having been admitted during the six months ending September
                                30th.</p>
                            <p>As regards the first of these statements it may be noted that the
                                official Japanese statistics show that the total number of passports
                                issued to persons of all classes proceeding to American territory in
                                1906 was 19,888, of whom 14,726 went to the Hawaiian Islands, and 5,
                                162 to the mainland, the latter number including all persons in
                                transit to other countries. In 1907 from January to October,
                                inclusive, the total number was 15, 168, of whom 10,732 went to the
                                Hawaiian Islands and 4,436 to the mainland.</p>
                            <p>Of the latter 3,648 belonged to the non-laboring classes and 752 were
                                laborers, either persons returning to the United States, the members
                                of the families of laborers already resident there, or agricultural
                                settlers. Count Hayashi is at a loss to account for the
                                discrepancies thus disclosed, but believes it may confidently be
                                stated that the number of passports alleged to have been granted to
                                laborers emigrating to the mainland in 1907 cannot possibly be
                                correct. It is true that it has come to the knowledge of the
                                Japanese Government that some laborers in the guise of merchants or
                                students have obtained passports to the American mainland, but
                                making reasonable allowance for all cases of that description the
                                total number must fall far short of that reported to the
                                Ambassador.</p>
                            <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0450"/>
                            <p>Count Hayashi desires it to be well understood, however, that the
                                Imperial Government have no wish to take advantage of mistakes of
                                this character or to cite them as a reason for non action. They
                                quite agree that the situation calls for some remedy in the
                                interests of both countries, and only call attention to this phase
                                of the subject because they feel assured that the American
                                Government will agree with them that overstatements of this kind,
                                even when unintentional and made in complete good faith, can have no
                                other effect than further to complicate and embarrass their joint
                                efforts to reach a reasonable and adequate understanding.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador states in his communication of November 16th that it
                                is the opinion of his Government that, <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The great number of Japanese coming to the Pacific Coast
                                        constitutes a case of emigration in mass, which is entirely
                                        different from that of ordinary and incidental travel and
                                        residence contemplated in the treaty, and injurious to the
                                        working people of the Pacific Coast, due to the lower
                                        standard of wages and cost of living of the Japanese, which
                                        enables them to supplant the American workman.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">To this statement His Excellency adds the following
                                comment: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I need not point out that Japan not only recognizes the
                                        right to protect her own laboring people against competition
                                        from foreign laborers, but in the late instance has shown
                                        such activity to make exclusion effective as to leave no
                                        doubt of her intention in the future. I have in mind the
                                        exclusion of the Chinese, and the enacting of certain
                                        ordinances excluding foreign workmen from the interior,
                                        except on special permit.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>These paragraphs are quoted in juxtaposition because it appears to
                                Count Hayashi, with all deference to the views expressed, that the
                                premise contained in the one hardly bears out the conclusion implied
                                in the other. As a matter of fact, the ordinance referred to in the
                                latter paragraph concerns only laborers from non-treaty States, or
                                States which do not concede to Japanese subjects the privilege to go
                                and carry on their avocations outside of certain specified treaty
                                limits. It in no way implies the adoption of a policy of exclusion
                                regarding laborers generally, or, in fact, regarding labor from the
                                countries in question when the formalities required by law are
                                observed. The large number of Chinese laborers of all classes in
                                Japan, among them nearly 9,000 in the island of Formosa alone who go
                                there annually under the terms of the ordinance, is proof of the
                                fact that a policy of exclusion is not enforced against Chinese
                                labor in the Empire.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi confesses to a certain degree of hesitancy in recurring
                                to the paragraph first quoted, as it comes within the category of
                                matters of domestic concern about which, as stated in another place,
                                he would prefer to refrain from comment. The mention of the <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0451"/>subject in the particular
                                connection in which it appears will, he trusts, be regarded as
                                sufficient warrant for mentioning certain reflections which suggest
                                themselves. The interests which Japan and the United States have in
                                common, their geographic neighborhood, the tempting opportunities
                                which the as yet only partly developed natural resources of the
                                Pacific Coast offer to all forms of legitimate enterprise, and the
                                scarcity of labor would seem, a priori, to render Japanese
                                immigration welcome. As a matter of fact that immigration has never,
                                at its highest flood, equalled in one year the number of immigrants
                                who frequently enter in one day at the port of New York, and Count
                                Hayashi believes it may be stated without fear of authoritative
                                contradiction that among the latter will be found a much larger
                                number of persons whose standard of living and of wages is no higher
                                than, or even so high as that of a greater number of Japanese from
                                the same class of life. Nor, in Count Hayashi’s opinion, has it ever
                                been clearly shown that the presence of Japanese in large numbers
                                upon the Pacific Coast has lowered those standards for the American
                                workman. The wages of the latter are nowhere higher than there, and
                                the rates have steadily increased during the years when the influx
                                of Japanese laborers was greatest. The latter have themselves
                                profited by securing the highest obtainable payment for the forms of
                                labor in which they are engaged. In fact it is one of the peculiar
                                ironies of the situation that while they have been charged, on the
                                one hand, with injuring the American workman by competition with
                                which he cannot cope, they have been persistently accused, on the
                                other, of greed in demanding the highest market rates for their
                                labor.</p>
                            <p>These are, however, details upon which it serves no useful purpose to
                                dilate. The immediate object which the Imperial Government have in
                                view is to overcome the practical difficulties of the situation by
                                meeting the wishes of the American Government so far as it can be
                                done with due regard for Japan’s interests and the dignity of the
                                State. It was for this purpose that Count Hayashi had the honor
                                yesterday frankly to explain the views of the Imperial Government
                                both verbally and in the form of the notes <hi rend="italic">pro

                            <p>By way of recapitulation and of additional explanation Count Hayashi
                                now begs to present, for the information of the American Government,
                                the following summary of the views of the Imperial Government and of
                                the measures they are prepared to take.</p>

                                    announced policy of issuing no passports good for the American
                                    mainland to either skilled or unskilled Japanese laborers,
                                    except to those who have previously resided in the United
                                    States, or the parents, wives or children of Japanese

                                <item>They intend, however, to continue to grant passports to
                                    settled agriculturists. As was known to the predecessor of His
                                    Excellency the Ambassador on the 26th of May last the Japanese
                                    Government have exercised with reference to those persons very
                                    careful and rigorous supervision and restriction. The privilege
                                    has only been granted to bona fide agriculturists intending to
                                    settle in certain specified localities. In order to avoid all
                                    possible subterfuge, the central administration will continue
                                    rigidly to apply the precautionary measures set forth in the
                                    explanatory memorandum of May 26th.<note n="25a" xml:id="d279fn25a">Not printed.</note></item>

                                <item>The Imperial Government have formulated instructions to local
                                    Governors that in every case of application for a passport to
                                    the United States by a student, merchant, tourist or the like,
                                    thorough investigation must be made to determine whether the
                                    applicant is not likely to become a laborer after reaching the
                                    United States. A material and indispensable part of this
                                    investigation relates to the financial status of the applicant.
                                    If he is not rich enough in his own right to assure the
                                    permanence of his status as a student, merchant or tourist,
                                    surety will be required of his family or special patron in the
                                    case of a student, or of his firm or company in the case of a
                                    merchant or mercantile employe, guaranteeing the payment of
                                    expenses and a monthly allowance of say 40 yen; and, in the case
                                    of tourists, the payment of sufficient travelling expenses. The

                                    <p>“The Government of the United States has received a
                                        telegraphic summary of His Excellency the Minister for
                                        Foreign Affairs two memoranda and is very sensible of the
                                        spirit of mutual helpfulness and frank and cordial
                                        cooperation in which the Imperial Japanese Government has
                                        received and commented upon the administrative measures
                                        which in November last the United States ventured to suggest
                                        in the same spirit and in hope of the speedy accomplishment
                                        in the manner most agreeable to Japan of a result equally
                                        recognized by the two governments as essential to their best
                                        interests.</p>
                                    <p>Feeling unjustified in the assumption that the measures
                                        contemplated, when reduced to definite and detailed form and
                                        placed in actual operation, will cover the ground of the
                                        first three of the suggestions submitted, it is still
                                        impossible for the United States to lay aside the conviction
                                        that an application in principle of some measures such as
                                        the fourth and fifth measures suggested would contribute to
                                        the practical effectiveness of the others and to the
                                        enforcement in this country of the Japanese Government’s own
                                        passport system, to which object alone have been addressed
                                        the steps hitherto taken.</p>
                                    <p>It is quite evident that the meaning of these two suggestions
                                        has not yet been made clear, and entire confidence is felt
                                        that upon further sympathetic examination of the subject the
                                        Imperial Japanese Government will find^ it possible to
                                        concur in the substance of these suggestions or to devise
                                        alternative measures designed to aid in attaining the ends
                                        which they were intended to subserve.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to the fourth suggestion it has not for one
                                        moment been contemplated that the holder of a passport
                                        should be deprived of any of his general rights thereunder,
                                        but only that the passport under the circumstances mentioned
                                        should not suffice to enable him to remain in American
                                        territory in violation of the conditions of emigration
                                        originally imposed by his own Government: that is to say
                                        that successful evasion of the limitations imposed by the
                                        Government of Japan upon its own subjects should not be held
                                        to create a right to be relieved from those limitations.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to the fifth suggestion there is evidently a
                                        misunderstanding, for the need of identification therein
                                        contemplated as a matter of course exists only in the case
                                        of those who are engaged in manual labor and in no case
                                        would a non-laboring Japanese be concerned. The Government
                                        of the United States, however, does not wish to press any of
                                        the ideas contained in the fifth suggestion to an extent not
                                        agreeable to the Government of Japan. The Government of the
                                        United States entertains the hope, however, that the <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0454"/>Imperial Japanese
                                        Government will take satisfaction in providing in its own
                                        way for some such systematic preservation of data as to its
                                        subjects who come to the United States with the permission
                                        of their own Government as may enable the two governments
                                        acting in harmony to prevent violation of the limits fixed
                                        by the Government of Japan upon emigration. The Government
                                        of the United States is now calling upon its citizens in all
                                        foreign countries to register at the United States
                                        consulates in the Districts where they reside, and has
                                        authorized its consuls to issue to them certificates of
                                        registration which are designed to be used by the citizens
                                        registered as readily producible evidence of their status
                                        and treaty rights. (See Executive Order April 8, 1907,
                                        amending paragraph 172, consular regulations, and Department
                                        circular, April 19, 1907).<note n="28" xml:id="d279fn28"><ref target="frus1907p1#pg_6"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1907, pt. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, pp. 6</ref> and <ref target="frus1907p1#pg_8">8</ref>.</note></p>
                                    <p>The fact that it has been found expedient and unobjectionable
                                        to apply such a policy to American citizens was in mind when
                                        the fifth suggestion was made. It may well be that the
                                        United States will find it necessary for the enforcement of
                                        the numerous provisions of its immigration laws, which there
                                        are frequent attempts to violate on the part of immigrants
                                        from all parts of the world, to adopt more stringent general
                                        provisions for the purpose of enabling American governmental
                                        officers to ascertain what aliens are lawfully and what
                                        aliens are unlawfully within American territory. In that
                                        event the Government of the United States will expect to
                                        proceed in entire harmony in every case with the government
                                        of the country of origin. In the meantime, however, the
                                        Government of the United States will be much gratified if
                                        the Imperial Japanese Government will give the subject its
                                        serious consideration.</p>
                                    <p>With regard to the sixth suggestion, the United States is
                                        easily able to impose upon companies whose steamships touch
                                        American ports the duty of returning at any time within
                                        three years aliens who enter American territory in violation
                                        of American law. By existing agreements this duty is assumed
                                        also by British lines to Canada. The Government of the
                                        United States hopes that the Imperial Japanese Government,
                                        upon re-examining the technical legal bearings of this
                                        question, may after all find it possible either to induce
                                        the Japanese steamship companies to join in such agreements,
                                        or else may discover administrative means to obtain the
                                        cooperation of the companies.</p>
                                    <p>As to the discrepancies discovered between the Japanese and
                                        American statistics, the Government of the United States can
                                        only say that its official statistics have been most
                                        carefully compiled from the manifests of incoming vessels
                                        and from actual count of arriving immigrants and their
                                        passports, and that these bear certainly every internal
                                        evidence of correctness. Under these circumstances there
                                        would seem to be some ground for the fear that fraud on no
                                        inconsiderable scale may have been practised by unscrupulous
                                        persons upon the passport system of the Imperial Japanese

                                        understood that a settled agriculturist is a small farmer

                                        issued to persons of such economic status. It is to be
                                        observed that unless the alleged character of farmer is
                                        accompanied by actual title to land it is quite likely to be
                                        merely a cover for a violation of our contract labor laws
                                        and this should be specifically guarded against.</item>

                                accompanying Count Hayashi’s note of December 31st, he outlined the
                                additional administrative measures for the regulation and control of
                                emigration which the Imperial Government are prepared to enforce.
                                The necessary steps are being taken to put those measures into
                                effective operation, and Count Hayashi is confident that they will
                                be found to cover the ground of <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0456"/>the first three of the suggestions made in the
                                memorandum transmitted with the Ambassador’s note of November 26th
                                    [<hi rend="italic">27th?</hi>].<note n="32" xml:id="d279fn32">See telegram of Nov. 18, 1907, to the Ambassador in Japan, <ref target="#pg_345">p. 345</ref>.</note> In the meantime, as
                                His Excellency is aware, the Imperial Government have anticipated
                                the enforcement of these additional measures by strictly limiting
                                emigration to the American mainland and by suspending for the time
                                being fresh emigration to the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
                            <p>So far as concerns the fourth and fifth suggestions embodied in the
                                Ambassador’s memorandum above cited, the Imperial Government still
                                find it impracticable to agree to the adoption in their entirety of
                                the measures therein proposed.</p>
                            <p>There seems to be some misapprehension on the part of the American
                                Government regarding the Japanese passport system, arising
                                apparently from the belief that the passports themselves contain
                                conditions the violation of which would justify the infliction of a
                                penalty. This is not, however, the case. Passports are issued in all
                                cases under fixed limitations, that is to say, only to persons
                                possessing certain special qualifications, which must be proved to
                                the satisfaction of the responsible authorities, who are instructed
                                to exercise the most careful scrutiny, and who, by aid of the new
                                administrative measures, will have additional and it is hoped more
                                effective means of determining the actual status of applicants. But
                                while by these means it may be confidently expected that the number
                                of evasions will be reduced to a minimum, the passports themselves
                                contain no conditions for the violation of which the Imperial
                                Government can inflict a penalty after the offender has passed
                                beyond their jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>But even if it were possible to exact such a penalty there are cases
                                where its imposition might amount to a positive injustice. It may
                                happen, for example, that the bearer of a student’s or merchant’s
                                passport, obtained in good faith, may be reduced through some
                                unanticipated misfortune to the necessity of manual labor.</p>
                            <p>Moreover there is another class of cases, also, in connection with
                                which a declaration of that kind might create embarrassment. This
                                includes a large number of Japanese laborers in the United States
                                with passports for the Hawaiian Islands, British Columbia and Mexico
                                who entered prior to the promulgation of the executive order of
                                March 14th, 1907.<note n="33" xml:id="d279fn33">See <hi rend="italic">Reports of the Department of Commerce and
                                        Labor, 1908</hi> (Washington, Government Printing Office,
                                    1909), p. 221.</note> It is quite apparent that the suggestion
                                in the Ambassador’s memorandum was not intended to be retroactive
                                and consequently has no reference to cases of this kind. But from
                                circumstances which have occurred since the issuance of the order
                                and from the greatly exaggerated statements which continue to appear
                                in the public press concerning the number of surreptitious <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0457"/>entries alleged to have
                                taken place since then, it is evident that serious confusion has
                                arisen between those laborers who violated no law when they entered
                                the United States and the much smaller number of persons possessing
                                similar passports who have evaded the prohibitions of the executive
                                order and administrative regulations. While the Imperial Government
                                sincerely deprecate the complications which have resulted, they fear
                                that a declaration on their part invalidating a certain class of
                                passports, even if they had the power to make it, so far from
                                remedying the situation might even lead to fresh complications. With
                                the enforcement of the precautionary measures now in contemplation
                                or in actual operation it may reasonably be expected that similar
                                causes of complaint will be of very rare occurrence. As an
                                additional precaution it is the intention of the Administrative
                                Authorities in every case of evasion of the limitations under which
                                passports are issued that comes to their knowledge to refuse further
                                applications for passports from the persons guilty of the fraud, and
                                to extend the prohibition to applications for passports for the
                                parents, wives and families of such persons. This is the only
                                practicable sanction which can be imposed, but experience will
                                doubtless prove its value, in cooperation with other preventive
                                measures, as a deterrent to fraud.</p>
                            <p>For these reasons, the Imperial Government believe they have good
                                ground for hesitating to declare in advance that all acts in
                                contravention of the representations upon which passports were
                                secured shall per se be tantamount to a forfeiture of any right
                                guaranteed by treaty or otherwise, the passport itself, as has
                                hitherto been explained, being merely the expression of the request
                                of the Japanese Government that the bearer, a Japanese subject,
                                shall be accorded the enjoyment of such rights.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi begs to thank His Excellency for the copy of the Order
                                establishing the registration of American citizens abroad and notes
                                with pleasure the considerate attitude of the American Government
                                with reference to the suggestion. The Imperial Government have
                                studied the subject with great interest, and have now the intention
                                of establishing a system for the registration of Japanese residents
                                in the United States as nearly similar to that described in the
                                Ambassador’s note as circumstances will permit. Certain practical
                                difficulties to which attention has already been drawn will have to
                                be overcome, such, for example, as are incident to the large areas
                                included within the jurisdiction of the Imperial Consular
                                establishments in the United States; the widely scattered places of
                                residence of Japanese residents, the nomadic habits which the
                                occupations of laborers in particular frequently entail, and the
                                absence of anything in the nature of a legal sanction whereby
                                registration may be rendered absolutely obligatory. This latter
                                obstacle may in a measure <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0458"/>be overcome, by refusing certain privileges to non-registered
                                persons which it is optional to accord, but even under the most
                                favorable circumstances the task of establishing and keeping such a
                                record will be a difficult one. It was not this circumstance alone,
                                however, which at first inclined the Imperial Government to regard
                                the suggestion as unacceptable, but the apprehension that the
                                adoption of such a system might be regarded as equivalent to an
                                admission that Japanese subjects not registered, although entitled
                                to be, might be held to have forfeited their right of residence in
                                the United States, or might at least be subjected to trouble and
                                expense difficult to bear. In other words, the Imperial Government,
                                as a matter of principle, were and still are averse to adding to the
                                obligations already incumbent on such Japanese subjects another
                                obligation, which might under easily supposable circumstances work
                                unmerited hardship. At the same time they fully realize the value of
                                frank and harmonious cooperation by the officials of the respective
                                Governments in this, as well as in all other matters connected with
                                emigration, not only as one of the most effective means of
                                preventing fraud, but also as the strongest safe-guard of the rights
                                of those mistakenly accused of it. Recognizing in the explanations
                                of His Excellency the importance which his Government attach to
                                procedure thus inspired, and highly appreciating, also, the
                                cordially conciliatory spirit which his comments display, the
                                Imperial Government have modified their opinion as above indicated,
                                and will establish a system of registration as soon as practicable.
                                It should be added, however, that while no effort will be spared to
                                make the registration as complete as possible, the Imperial
                                Government will not consider that the absence of registration
                                constitutes a reason for the forfeiture of residential rights.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the sixth suggestion, that the Imperial Government
                                shall cooperate with the Government of the United States to compel
                                steamship companies to carry back ineligible emigrants, Count
                                Hayashi regrets to say that there is no provision in Japanese law,
                                similar to that in force in the United States, granting this power
                                to the Administrative Authorities, and that at the present juncture
                                it would be useless to attempt to secure the passage of such a
                                measure by the Diet. It occurs to him, however, that by reason of
                                the measures of restriction upon emigration to territories adjacent
                                to the United States the cause for anxiety on this score will
                                disappear.</p>
                            <p>Since the receipt of the Ambassador’s note of the 25th ult.,<note n="34" xml:id="d279fn34">See telegram of Jan. 23, 1908, from the
                                    Department to the Ambassador in Japan, which was communicated to

                                thorough examination to be made of the statistics of emigration
                                during the past two years. This investigation has not only included
                                the official statistics but also the passenger lists of steamship
                                companies. The result confirms in <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0459"/>all essential details the statement made in his
                                memorandum of December 31st. He is quite at a loss to account for
                                the discrepancies thus disclosed, although possibly a partial
                                explanation may be found in the fact that the American annual
                                statements are for the year ending September 30th, while the
                                Japanese statistics are for the calendar year; and, also, as regards
                                the respective monthly statements, in the differences incident to
                                the enumeration at the time of the arrival in the one case and of
                                departure in the other. However that may be, Count Hayashi begs to
                                repeat that the Imperial Government have no wish to lay undue stress
                                upon any mistakes of this kind which may have occurred, particularly
                                since at the present time the subject possesses more interest as a
                                matter of record than as one of practical moment.</p>
                            <p>His Excellency the Ambassador did Count Hayashi the favor to transmit
                                with his note of the 25th ultimo a copy of the Executive Order of
                                April 8, 1907, defining the term “laborer, skilled and unskilled”,
                                and also certain supplementary measures, the administration of
                                which, in conjunction with those already proposed, it is thought
                                “will make still more effective the policy of the Japanese
                                Government in respect to the subject under discussion.”</p>
                            <p>Taking these measures in the order in which they are stated in the
                                enclosure with His Excellency’s note, Count Hayashi beg[s] to submit
                                the following observations: <list>
                                    <item><hi rend="italic">First</hi>. The passports of foreign
                                        countries, some fifteen in number, have been examined and
                                        compared and as a result it has been resolved to introduce
                                        certain modifications into the passport form now employed
                                        including various matters of detail embodied in most foreign
                                        passports. The Ambassador no doubt understands from the
                                        explanations already made to him that the forgery of the
                                        passports at present in use is thought to be virtually a
                                        negligible danger. That, however, will not be regarded as a
                                        reason for omitting whatever additional safeguards the above
                                        changes may afford against the perpetration of fraud of all
                                        descriptions.</item>
                                    <item><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. Passports to laborers who
                                        have already been in America and to the parents, wives and
                                        children of laborers resident there, are issued upon the
                                        production, in the former case, of the certificate of a
                                        Consular officer in the United States and, in the latter,
                                        upon the production of such certificate and of a duly
                                        certified copy of the official registry of the members of
                                        the family in Japan. No passport can be issued by any local
                                        official in Japan except upon the presentation of such
                                        certificate or certificates, duly authenticated, and both
                                        Consular Officers and local officials are instructed to omit
                                        no precaution against possible fraud in the exercise of the
                                        duties entrusted to them.</item>

                                        “settled agriculturist” the understanding expressed in the
                                        Ambassador’s memorandum virtually agrees with that of the
                                        Imperial Government as explained in the note to His
                                        Excellency’s predecessor dated May 16, 1907.<note n="35" xml:id="d279fn35">Not printed.</note> The settled
                                        agriculturist must in every case be a person who has
                                        invested capital in the enterprise, and whose share of its
                                        proceeds, if it is carried on in partnership, will of course
                                        be in proportion to the amount of his investment. Nor is any
                                        such undertaking sanctioned unless title to the land,
                                        whether by leasehold or in fee simple, has actually been
                                        acquired. The greatest care is exercised with reference to
                                        this point and not only are detailed reports required from
                                        Consular officers cognizant with the circumstances, but also
                                        the certificates of Notaries Public attesting the bona fides
                                        of the transaction. Local officials are not authorized to
                                        issue passports in this class of cases, but all applications
                                        therefor, as well as all other applications relating to the
                                        matter, must pass through the Foreign Office and receive its
                                        direct sanction.</item>
                                    <item><hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>. The definition of “laborer,
                                        skilled and unskilled” given in the Executive Order of April
                                        8, 1907, (a copy of which was transmitted with the
                                        Ambassador’s note), contains no particular which the
                                        Imperial Government can regard as inapplicable in
                                        determining the status of persons of that class. Count
                                        Hayashi notes, however, that it is stated in the Order that
                                        the definition is subject to change, and consequently he
                                        cannot go so far as to say that the meaning attached by the
                                        Imperial Government to the term will always conform to the
                                        definition as thus amended.</item>

                                        hitherto followed with reference to Japanese emigration to
                                        the Hawaiian Islands was explained, and it was added that
                                        from considerations based upon the fundamental differences
                                        between the Hawaiian Islands and the American mainland,
                                        economic, geographic and historical “The Imperial Government
                                        earnestly desire that the territory of Hawaii be set outside
                                        the scope of the present discussion.” It was added that this
                                        desire by no means implied an intention on the part of the
                                        Imperial Government to insist upon the permanent
                                        continuation of the present system. It signified merely, as
                                        the context indicated, the belief that the exceptional labor
                                        requirements of the Hawaiian Islands and the equally
                                        exceptional circumstances under which Japanese emigration
                                        thither originated and reached its present proportions
                                        differentiated the question from that of ordinary emigration
                                        and rendered its separate consideration both logical and <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0461"/>mutually desirable.
                                        As was also explained, Japanese emigration to Hawaii has
                                        hitherto been almost exclusively in response to the
                                        requirements of the industry to which the Territory owes its
                                        present high standard of wealth and prosperity, in other
                                        words, to the operation of the law of demand and supply.
                                        Recognizing the value of the mutual benefits which have
                                        followed in such full measure, the Imperial Government have
                                        no other wish than that future emigration to Hawaii shall
                                        proceed upon the same lines, but in no case in excess of
                                        natural and legitimate demands, since it is self-evident
                                        that excessive emigration would be as harmful to the
                                        interests of the emigrants themselves as it could possibly
                                        be to any other.</item>

                            <p>With reference to the question of embodying in the context of
                                passports to Japanese subjects proceeding abroad some form of
                                warning against false representations in obtaining them, Count
                                Hayashi has already had the honor to explain to His Excellency the
                                American Ambassador the reasons why the Imperial Government object
                                to such a departure from ordinary usage. His Excellency now suggests
                                that such warning, if not made a part of the text of the passport
                                itself, might without objection, be placed upon a separate piece of
                                paper attached to, or delivered with the document. Count Hayashi
                                believes, however, that the end in view can be attained by other
                                means as effectively as in the manner suggested. The requisit[e]
                                warning, for example, can be given in clear and unmistakable terms
                                to the applicant at the time the passport is issued; or the
                                prefectural authorities can issue general official notices
                                admonishing applicants regarding false representations and the
                                fraudulent use of passports. By these means it may be confidently
                                expected that there will be left no room for reasonable doubt that
                                persons obtaining passports will clearly comprehend the nature and
                                scope of the obligations they assume.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador refers to certain features embodied in his note of
                                December 25th [<hi rend="italic">26th?</hi>] last,<note n="38" xml:id="d279fn38">Not printed.</note> and afterwards made the
                                subject of personal conferences, but which he remarks are not
                                embodied in either of Count Hayashi’s notes. Count Hayashi begs to
                                state that this omission on his part formally to reply to the
                                suggestions in <pb n="368" xml:id="pg_368" facs="0462"/>question was
                                due to the impression that the explanations already given had
                                apprised His Excellency of his views regarding them.</p>
                            <p>The first of these matters has relation to the suggested issuance of
                                passports by a limited number of officials especially designated for
                                the purpose. The Ambassador now calls attention to the desirability,
                                “at least in respect to all cases of doubt, notably small merchants,
                                students and others of like type, as well as settled
                                agriculturalists”, of having passports issued directly by the
                                Foreign Office, Count Hayashi does not question the utility of such
                                a rule, particularly under existing circumstances. As a matter of
                                fact it is already followed to a certain extent, the practice being
                                to require the reference to the Foreign Office by local officials of
                                all cases involving serious doubt of the qualifications of
                                applicants for passports. In the way of additional precaution,
                                having in view exigencies arising from the enforcement of new
                                administrative measures, instructions have been issued to local
                                officials widening the scope of this rule. One of the obstacles to
                                its application in all cases is the great amount of additional labor
                                which that would entail, but a plan for the increase of the clerical
                                force of the Foreign Office has been formulated, which, if it
                                receives legislative sanction, will make it possible to bring all
                                cases involving questions of doubt within the sphere of the
                                department’s direct action.</p>
                            <p>The observation of His Excellency the Ambassador concerning the
                                advisability of strictly scrutinizing the qualifications of settled
                                agriculturalists are quite in harmony with the views and intentions
                                of the Imperial Government as explained in Count Hayashi’s previous
                                communications. It may be added however that while settled
                                agriculturalists are laborers in the same sense as farmers, they are
                                also, from the other point of view different to ordinary laborers,
                                since it is an absolute prerequisite that they must have a bona fide
                                pecuniary interest in the enterprises in which they engage apart
                                from the returns derived from their own manual labor.</p>
                            <p>In conformity with the verbal assurances already given to the
                                Ambassador, Count Hayashi has the honor to state that there is no
                                objection to the proposal that the two Governments should furnish
                                each other, as promptly as possible, after the first of each month,
                                statistics as to Japanese subjects belonging to the classes to whom
                                this correspondence refers going to, or returning from the ports of
                                the respective countries.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi has hitherto refrained from alluding formally to the
                                proposal that Japanese subjects should be registered at the ports of
                                arrival, because he had hoped that the plan of registration he had
                                the honor to suggest in his note of the 18th instant<note n="39" xml:id="d279fn39"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_361">p. 361</ref>.</note> would <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0463"/>meet the requirements of the
                                situation; and because, moreover, the proposal appeared to him to be
                                open to objections which rendered its adoption unadvisible. Among
                                these might be mentioned the additional serious detention to which
                                Japanese passengers of all classes would be subjected if the
                                registration were carefully performed, and the very probable
                                contingency that it might not after all be final as the destinations
                                of the immigrants might be other Consular districts where the
                                process would have to be repeated.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi observes in the Ambassador’s note of the 22nd [<hi rend="italic">21st?</hi>] instant<note n="40" xml:id="d279fn40">Not printed.</note> indications of a certain degree of
                                disappointment because the plan of legislation [<hi rend="italic">registration?</hi>] proposed in his note of the 18th instant
                                was not of a more positive and affirmative character. As was
                                explained in that communication, however, it is the only plan which
                                it is in the power of the Imperial Government to put into operation.
                                The efficiency of such a plan must of course depend upon the
                                sanction enforcing compliance with its provisions. In this case,
                                although the Imperial Government are unable directly to compel the
                                Japanese subjects to register as desired, they can indirectly make
                                registration highly desirable if not indispensable in the majority
                                of instances, by refusing to grant certain consular certificates to
                                non-registered persons. These include certificates relating to
                                conscription and various matters affecting personal rights and
                                status the possession of which, in view of the processes of Japanese
                                law, is of great importance to most Japanese residents abroad.</p>
                            <p>Count Hayashi is gratified to find in the Ambassador’s statement with
                                reference to the course to be adopted in the event of future renewal
                                of Japanese emigration to Hawaii substantial accord with the opinion
                                entertained by the Imperial Government, which is that if at any time
                                hereafter it should appear desirable to depart from the present
                                policy of prohibition, that step should only be taken after
                                ascertaining through an American official source the labor
                                conditions prevailing in the Islands and the need thereof.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In view of certain statements in the
                            report of the House Committee on Immigration—“Report No. 350, March 24,
                            1924”— regarding the so-called “Gentlemen’s Agreement”, some of which
                            appear to be misleading, I may be allowed to state to you the purpose
                            and substance of that agreement as it is understood and performed <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0464"/>by my Government, which
                            understanding and practice are, I believe, in accord with those of your
                            Government on this subject.</p>
                        <p>The Gentlemen’s Agreement is an understanding with the United States
                            Government by which the Japanese Government voluntarily undertook to
                            adopt and enforce certain administrative measures designed to check the
                            emigration to the United States of Japanese laborers. It is in no way
                            intended as a restriction on the sovereign right of the United States to
                            regulate its immigration. This is shown by the fact that the existing
                            Immigration Act of 1917,<note n="41" xml:id="d280fn41">39 Stat.
                                874.</note> for instance, is applied to Japanese as to other
                            aliens.</p>
                        <p>It was because of the fact that discriminatory immigration legislation on
                            the part of the United States would naturally wound the national
                            susceptibilities of the Japanese people that, after thorough but most
                            friendly and frank discussions between the two Governments, the
                            Gentlemen’s Agreement was made for the purpose of relieving the United
                            States from the possible unfortunate necessity of offending the natural
                            pride of a friendly nation.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government have most scrupulously and faithfully carried out
                            the terms of the Agreement, as a self-imposed restriction, and are fully
                            prepared to continue to do so, as officially announced at the time of
                            the conclusion of the present Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between
                            Japan and the United States. In return the Japanese Government
                            confidently trust that the United States Government will recommend, if
                            necessary, to the Congress to refrain from resorting to a measure that
                            would seriously wound the proper susceptibilities of the Japanese
                            nation.</p>
                        <p>One object of the Gentlemen’s Agreement is, as is pointed out above, to
                            stop the emigration to the United States of all Japanese laborers other
                            than those excepted in the Agreement, which is embodied in a series of
                            long and detailed correspondence between the two Governments,
                            publication of which is not believed to serve any good purpose, but the
                            essential terms and practice of which may be summed up as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The Japanese Government will not issue passports good for the
                            Continental United States to laborers, skilled or unskilled, except
                            those previously domiciled in the United States, or parents, wives, or
                            children under twenty years of age of such persons. The form of the
                            passport is so designed as to omit no safeguard against forgery, and its
                            issuance is governed by various rules of detail in order to prevent
                            fraud.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government accepted the definition of “laborer” as given in
                            the United States Executive Order of April 8, 1907.</p>
                        <p>(2) Passports are to be issued by a limited number of specially
                            authorized officials only, under close supervision of the Foreign
                            Office, which has the supreme control of the matter and is equipped <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0465"/>with the necessary staff for
                            the administration of it. These officials shall make thorough
                            investigation when application for passports is made by students,
                            merchants, tourists, or the like, to ascertain whether the applicant is
                            likely to become a laborer, and shall enforce the requirement that such
                            person shall either be supplied with adequate means to insure the
                            permanence of his status as such or that surety be given therefor. In
                            case of any doubt as to whether such applicant is or is not entitled to
                            a passport, the matter shall be referred to the Foreign Office for
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>Passports to laborers previously domiciled in the United States will be
                            issued only upon production of certificate from Japanese Consular
                            officers in the United States, and passports to the parents, wives and
                            children of such laborers will be issued only upon production of such
                            consular certificate and of duly certified copy of official registry of
                            members of such laborer’s family in Japan. Utmost circumspection is
                            exercised to guard against fraud.</p>
                        <p>(3) Issuance of passports to so-called “picture brides” has been stopped
                            by the Japanese Government since March 1, 1920, although it had not been
                            prohibited under the terms of the Gentlemen’s Agreement.</p>
                        <p>(4) Monthly statistics covering incoming and outgoing Japanese are
                            exchanged between the American and Japanese Governments.</p>
                        <p>(5) Although the Gentlemen’s Agreement is not applicable to the Hawaiian
                            Islands, measures restricting issuance of passports for the Islands are
                            being enforced in substantially the same manner as those for the
                            Continental United States.</p>
                        <p>(6) The Japanese Government are further exercising strict control over
                            emigration of Japanese laborers to foreign territories contiguous to the
                            United States in order to prevent their surreptitious entry into the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>A more condensed substance of these terms is published in the Annual
                            Report of the United States Commissioner-General of Immigration for
                            1908, 1909 and 1910 on pages 125–6, 121, and 124–5, respectively.</p>
                        <p>As I stated above, the Japanese Government have been most faithfully
                            observing the Gentlemen’s Agreement in every detail of its terms, which
                            fact is, I believe, well known to the United States Government. I may be
                            permitted, in this connection, to call your attention to the official
                            figures published in the Annual Reports of the United States
                            Commissioner-General of Immigration, showing the increase or decrease of
                            Japanese population in the Continental United States by immigration and
                            emigration. According to these reports<note n="*" xml:id="d280fn40">See
                                “Table B” of the Annual Reports. [Footnote in the original.]</note>
                            in the years 1908–1923 the total numbers of Japanese admitted to and
                            departed from the Continental United States were respectively 120,317
                            and 111,636. In other words the excess of those admitted over those
                            departed was in fifteen years only 8,681, that is to say, the annual
                            average of 578. It is important to note that in these 8,681 are included
                            not only those who are covered by the <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0466"/>terms of the Gentlemen’s Agreement, but all other
                            classes of Japanese such as merchants, students, tourists, Government
                            officials, etc. These figures collected by the United States Immigration
                            authorities seem to me to show conclusively the successful operation of
                            the Gentlemen’s Agreement. Besides this there is, of course, the
                            increase through birth of the Japanese population in the United States.
                            This has nothing to do with either the Gentlemen’s Agreement or the
                            Immigration laws.</p>
                        <p>I may add in this connection that if the proposition were whether it
                            would not be desirable to amend or modify some of the terms of the
                            Agreement, the question would be different, and I personally believe
                            that my Government would not be unwilling to discuss the matter with
                            your Government, if such were its wishes.</p>
                        <p>Further, if I may speak frankly, at the risk of repeating what, under
                            instructions from my Government, I have represented to you on former
                            occasions, the mere fact that a certain clause, obviously aimed against
                            Japanese as a nation, is introduced in the proposed immigration bill, in
                            apparent disregard of the most sincere and friendly endeavors on the
                            part of the Japanese Government to meet the needs and wishes of the
                            American Government and people, is mortifying enough to the Government
                            and people of Japan. They are, however, exercising the utmost
                            forbearance at this moment, and in so doing they confidently rely upon
                            the high sense of justice and fair-play of the American Government and
                            people, which, when properly approached, will readily understand why no
                            such discriminatory provision as above-referred to should be allowed to
                            become a part of the law of the land.</p>
                        <p>It is needless to add that it is not the intention of the Japanese
                            Government to question the sovereign right of any country to regulate
                            immigration to its own territories. Nor is it their desire to send their
                            nationals to the countries where they are not wanted. On the contrary
                            the Japanese Government showed from the very beginning of this problem
                            their perfect willingness to cooperate with the United States Government
                            to effectively prevent by all honorable means the entrance into the
                            United States of such Japanese nationals as are not desired by the
                            United States, and have given ample evidences thereof, the facts of
                            which are well-known to your Government. To Japan the question is not
                            one of expediency, but of principle. To her the mere fact that a few
                            hundreds or thousands of her nationals will or will not be admitted into
                            the domains of other countries is immaterial, so long as no question of
                            national susceptibilities is involved. The important question is whether
                            Japan as a nation is or is not entitled to the proper respect and
                            consideration of other nations. In other words the Japanese Government
                            ask of the United States Government simply that proper consideration <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0467"/>ordinarily given by one nation
                            to the self respect of another, which after all forms the basis of
                            amicable international intercourse throughout the civilized world.</p>
                        <p>It is indeed impossible for my Government and people, and I believe it
                            would be impossible also for your Government and for those of your
                            people who had made a careful study of the subject, to understand why it
                            should be necessary for your country to enact as the law of the land,
                            such a clause as Section 12 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the House
                            Immigration bill.</p>
                        <p>As is justly pointed out in your letter of February 8, 1924, to the
                            Chairman of the House Committee on Immigration,<note n="42" xml:id="d280fn42"><ref target="frus1924v01#pg_214">Vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 214</ref>.</note> it is idle to
                            insist that the provision is not aimed at the Japanese, for the proposed
                            measure (Section 25) continues in force your existing legislation
                            regulating Chinese immigration and the barred-zone provisions of your
                            immigration laws which prohibit immigration from certain other portions
                            of Asia—to say nothing about the public statements of the sponsors and
                            supporters of that particular provision as to its aim. In other words
                            the manifest object of the said Section 12 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) is
                            to single out Japanese as a nation, stigmatizing them as unworthy and
                            undesirable in the eyes of the American people. And yet the actual
                            result of that particular provision, if the proposed bill becomes the
                            law as intended, would be to exclude only 146 Japanese per year. On the
                            other hand the Gentlemen’s Agreement is, in fact, accomplishing all that
                            can be accomplished by the proposed Japanese exclusion clause except for
                            those 146. It is indeed difficult to believe that it can be the
                            intention of the people of your great country, who always stand for high
                            principles of justice and fair-play in the intercourse of nations, to
                            resort—in order to secure the annual exclusion of 146 Japanese—to a
                            measure which would not only seriously offend the just pride of a
                            friendly nation, that has been always earnest and diligent in its
                            efforts to preserve the friendship of your people, but would also seem
                            to involve the question of the good faith and therefore of the honor of
                            their Government, or at least of its executive branch.</p>
                        <p>Relying upon the confidence you have been good enough to show me at all
                            times, I have stated or rather repeated all this to you very candidly
                            and in a most friendly spirit, for I realize, as I believe you do, the
                            grave consequences which the enactment of the measure retaining that
                            particular provision would inevitably bring upon the otherwise happy and
                            mutually advantageous relations between our two countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the note of April 10, in which, referring to the recent
                            Report of the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization of the House
                            of Representatives (Report No. 350, March 24, 1924), you took occasion
                            to state your Government’s understanding of the purport of the so-called
                            “Gentlemen’s Agreement”, and your Government’s practice and purposes
                            with respect to emigration from Japan to this country.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to take note of your statement concerning the substance of the
                            so-called “Gentlemen’s Agreement” resulting from the correspondence
                            which took place between our two Governments in 1907–8, as modified by
                            the additional undertaking of the Japanese Government with regard to the
                            so-called “picture brides” which became effective four years ago. Your
                            statement of the essential points constituting the Gentlemen’s Agreement
                            corresponds with my own understanding of that arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as your note is directed towards clearing away any possible
                            misapprehension as to the nature and purpose of the “Gentlemen’s
                            Agreement”, I am taking occasion to communicate copies of it, as also of
                            my present reply, to the Chairman of the appropriate Committees of the
                            two Houses of Congress.</p>

                            express considerable apprehension over the status of the immigration
                            question. The <hi rend="italic">Jiji</hi>, not accustomed to speaking

                            friendship.” While the chauvinist <hi rend="italic">Yorodzu</hi> says:

                            the two countries, a certain section of the press at once gave great
                            prominence to these words as implying a threat, although it is manifest

                            those senators who had supported the Department’s view as to the
                            desirability of retaining the Gentlemen’s Agreement withdrew their
                            support, and the bill reported by the Senate Immigration Committee,
                            making provision by which the present practice in regard to the
                            Gentlemen’s Agreement could be continued, was defeated by a vote of 76
                            to 2. It now appears inevitable that the Senate will adopt in regard to
                            this matter the provisions of the Johnson Bill passed by the House on
                            April 12, which denies admission to immigrant aliens ineligible to

                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lodge</hi>. I regret to say that the letter
                                addressed to our State Department by the Ambassador from Japan seems
                                to me a letter improper to be addressed by the representative of one
                                great country to another friendly country. It contains, I regret
                                much to say, a veiled threat. Now, Mr. President, the United States
                                can not legislate by the exercise by any other country of veiled
                                threats. Owing to this, what we are now doing assumes the character
                                of an international precedent; and I think it should be understood,
                                and understood by the whole world, that the United States alone is
                                to say who shall come into the United States to form part of its
                                citizenship. What our country determines as to its immigration is
                                neither a just cause of offense nor a subject for war or threats of
                                war. It is an undoubted sovereign right and nothing else.”</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Moses</hi>. May I inquire of the Senator
                                why he repeatedly uses the words ‘veiled threat’? The Senator knows
                                perfectly well that in the composition of diplomatic communications
                                the two words ‘grave consequences’ are not veiled. They are well
                                known in their implication.”</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Lodge</hi>. They are just as well known as
                                the phrase ‘the United States could not regard with indifference’
                                the violation of the Monroe doctrine. Everybody knows what ‘can not
                                regard with indifference’s means. Both phrases are the
                                well-recognized language of diplomacy.</p>
                            <p>“The letter of the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. President, has created a
                                situation which makes it impossible for me to support the pending
                                amendment. When I was interrupted I was about to say that this
                                amendment has now assumed the dignity of a precedent, and I never
                                will consent to establish any precedent which will give any nation
                                the right to think that they can stop by threats or by compliments
                                the action of the United States when it determines who shall come
                                within its gates and become part of its citizenship. That is a
                                decision which belongs to the United States alone, and from that
                                decision there can be no appeal.”</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Reed</hi>. I think I speak the feeling of
                                the entire Committee on Immigration when I say that one of the
                                principal points we had in mind was to do nothing offensive to the
                                Japanese; that one of our purposes in putting this amendment in was
                                to recognize the Gentlemen’s Agreement; and that we felt, further,
                                that the restriction of Japanese immigration could best be
                                accomplished by combining the Gentlemen’s Agreement with a very
                                rigid quota law which would hold down the number of Japanese to the
                                minimum, for at the same time we would thus get the cooperation of
                                the Japanese Government in applying that quota law.</p>
                            <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0471"/>
                            <p>“It was our feeling that that would be more effective than such an
                                exclusion section as has been offered by the Senator from
                                California. It was a choice of methods. To our mind one was a
                                friendly method and the other was at least open to the charge of
                                being an unfriendly method involving some racial discrimination. It
                                was with that thought that the committee offered the amendment.</p>
                            <p>“Now, however, Mr. President—and I am speaking only for myself in
                                this—I think the situation has changed. I think it ceases to be a
                                question whether this is a desirable method of restricting Japanese
                                immigration. The letter of the Japanese Ambassador puts the
                                unpleasant burden upon us of deciding whether we will permit our
                                legislation to be controlled by apprehensions of ‘grave
                                consequences’ with other nations if we do not follow a particular
                                line of legislative conduct. I, for one, feel compelled, on account
                                of that veiled threat, to vote in favor of the exclusion and against
                                the committee amendment.</p>
                            <p>“I say that with deep regret, because I believe that this action,
                                which is forced upon us, means the waste of much of the results of
                                20 years of excellent diplomacy. It means the waste of much of the
                                good feeling that followed the ratification of the four-power
                                    treaty,<note n="47" xml:id="d284fn47"><ref target="frus1922v01#pg_33"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                        p. 33</ref>.</note> and it means a loss of part of the good
                                relations that followed the prompt and friendly action of America
                                after the Japanese earthquake of last year. When I vote against the
                                committee amendment I expect to do so with a sad heart.”</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Pepper</hi>. Mr. President, I wish to
                                direct attention to one aspect of this matter which seems to me to
                                have been insufficiently emphasized. As I understand the Gentlemen’s
                                Agreement, it is an agreement between parties neither of whom make
                                reference to force, to pressure, or to the gravity of the
                                consequences which will ensue if the agreement is not made, or, if
                                it is in existence, whether it should be abrogated.</p>
                            <p>“As long as the Gentlemen’s Agreement between Japan and the United
                                States was left in the atmosphere in which it was generated, I was
                                prepared to vote for its continuance. But the proposition which I
                                wish to submit to the Senate is that the Gentlemen’s Agreement has
                                been abrogated, and not by the United States. The instant the
                                Japanese Ambassador makes a formal communication to this Government
                                suggesting, through proper diplomatic channels, that unless certain
                                legislative action is taken by us the gravest consequences are
                                likely to ensue, at that moment the whole matter passes out of the
                                sphere of a Gentlemen’s Agreement, and it becomes necessary for us
                                to act, as it seems to me, in the colder and perhaps calmer
                                atmosphere which characterizes mere legislative deliberations.”</p>
                            <p>“I am not insensible to what has been said by my colleague, the
                                junior Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reed), about his apprehension
                                of unhappiness, ill feeling, and dissatisfaction; and yet it
                                sometimes happens that where one is compelled to recognize that such
                                a relation as has existed can no longer exist, where one must take a
                                clean-cut and definite position respecting the terms and
                                consequences of which there can be no misunderstanding—it sometimes
                                happens, I say, that the air is cleared, that the atmosphere ceases
                                to be surcharged <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0472"/>with
                                doubt, with uncertainty, and suspicion, and that the way is open to
                                a more permanent and more satisfactory international relationship
                                even than that which has theretofore existed.</p>
                            <p>“Therefore I am one of those, Mr. President, who very earnestly hope
                                that this action will not be misinterpreted by our Japanese friends
                                as an evidence on our part of a lack of appreciation of them, of
                                their many fine and noble qualities, and of the many admirable
                                features of their civilization, and that they will not regard us as
                                having forgotten the closeness of the tie which has bound us in the
                                past, but rather that it will be recognized that, perhaps out of
                                deference to their great and exceptional position in the family of
                                nations, it has been necessary for us to pass beyond the realm of
                                ‘Gentlemen’s Agreements’ and to mark legislatively the line which,
                                after all, exists in fact, whether any act of the legislature
                                recognizes it or not, between oriental civilization and that which
                                we express.</p>
                            <p>“I am going to vote, therefore, Mr. President, otherwise than I had
                                originally intended to vote; and I am going to do it not in heat,
                                not in irritation, not as a protest against what has been written by
                                the Japanese Ambassador, but rather because I recognize what he has
                                written as of itself terminating the status that has heretofore
                                existed.”</p>
                            <p>“<hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Willis</hi>. Mr. President, I desire to say
                                only a brief word upon the pending question. As a member of the
                                Committee on Immigration, I agreed to the action which the Committee
                                took, and of course expected to support the committee amendment
                                which, in substance, recognizes the ‘Gentlemen’s Agreement’ with
                                Japan. I was one of those who believed that if substantially, as I
                                thought, the same result could be obtained under that agreement as
                                could be had from stringent limitation upon Japanese immigration
                                without disturbing the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>, it would
                                be better so to do. It was, therefore, the effort of the
                                committee—an effort which met with my approval—so to shape the
                                legislation as to let this situation alone.</p>
                            <p>“I accordingly expected, as I have said, to support the committee
                                recommendation; but, Mr. President, I think a new situation has
                                arisen, not because of any action of our Government, but, as the
                                Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pepper) has said, I must say without
                                bitterness or ill feeling, it is a fact, that this situation that is
                                new and quite unusual has been created by the letter that has come
                                to the Senate from the Ambassador representing the great Empire of
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p>“Therefore, Mr. President, because of this new situation that has
                                been created, I do not see how there is anything left for the Senate
                                to do other than to announce by its action in unmistakable terms
                                that we regard the question of immigration as an American question;
                                that we do not concede that any Nation anywhere upon the earth has
                                the right to say to the United States what our policy in that behalf
                                shall be. Therefore, calmly and deliberately and without any
                                bitterness toward our Japanese friends or feeling against the
                                Japanese Government, with which I trust the United States may always
                                remain on the most friendly terms, I shall cast my vote against the
                                pending amendment.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hanihara called on me, on the afternoon of April 15, to discuss
                            informally the adverse action taken by the Senate on April 14 with
                            reference to the Gentlemen’s Agreement. He said that he came not as
                            Japanese Ambassador to make any representations or any inquiries, but
                            simply to talk the matter over frankly and outspokenly as between
                            personal friends. He stated that in any case he would not be prepared to
                            speak as Ambassador, since he was expecting instructions from his
                            Government on the subject which had not yet arrived.</p>
                        <p>He was obviously very greatly distressed by the action of the Senate, and
                            found some difficulty in expressing his disappointment and chagrin at
                            the construction which had been placed upon his note. He had with him a
                            copy of the <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi> containing the
                            record of the debate in which his note had been described as a veiled
                            threat; and pointing to the marked passages in the <hi rend="italic">Record</hi>, he said that he was altogether unable to understand
                            how the Senators had been able to misconstrue his meaning in that way.
                            He insisted that such an idea as a threat was the furthest thing from
                            his mind—that the implication of ill will towards the United States on
                            his part was wholly without justification—that he had not “in any part
                            of his body” any feeling of unfriendliness or of antagonism—that, on the
                            contrary, his experience and his associations with this country were
                            such that he felt it was the real mission of his life to contribute what
                            he could to a better understanding between Japan and America.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>He went back to the subject of the entirely friendly intentions of his
                            note, and asked if that had not been quite clear to us. He seemed to be
                            disturbed by a fear that the Secretary might share the feeling that his
                            note had in fact conveyed a threat; so I took it upon myself to relieve
                            his mind on this point by saying that I would read to him the substance
                            of the telegram which the Secretary had just sent for the information of
                            our Ambassador at Tokyo (No. 54, April 15, 1 p.m.), from which he would
                            see that the Secretary had not misunderstood him as intending anything
                            in the note as a threat. He seemed very much relieved by this evidence
                            of the Secretary’s understanding of his position.</p>
                        <p>He spoke casually on the possibility that this incident would react
                            unfavorably upon himself personally, saying that there were <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0474"/>many people in Japan who did not like
                            him or his ideas who would of course make this the occasion for attacks
                            upon him; but he went on to say that this personal aspect of the matter
                            was of no importance to him in comparison with the question of the
                            effect upon the relations between the two countries. He said that the
                            passage of an exclusion law would of course have a bad effect upon those
                            relations, and undo much of the feeling of confidence that had been
                            built up in Japan. He was afraid, also, that the reports of the attitude
                            taken by the Senate would leave upon the minds of the American people
                            the impression that Japan had aggressively and highhandedly interfered
                            in our affairs. Even though his note had been published he apprehended
                            that people in, general, merely reading the newspaper headlines or brief
                            summaries of the remarks made in the Senate, would derive an impression
                            that he had addressed the Congress directly upon a matter of pending
                            legislation, and in a minatory tone. He therefore suggested whether it
                            might not be well to correct this impression by a statement, to be
                            issued either by himself or by the Secretary, as might be judged most
                            fitting, pointing out that the note had been directed to the Secretary
                            of State in the usual way, and did not in fact contain any such
                            implications as the Senate had read into it. I said that of course there
                            were no two ways of thinking about the desirability of clearing up any
                            misunderstanding but that the suggestion that this be done by means of a
                            published statement involved estimates of its practicability and
                            probable effectiveness, as to which I could not venture an opinion. He
                            then said that he would like to talk this matter over with the
                            Secretary, upon his return from New York, today. I said that I felt sure
                            the Secretary would be glad to discuss the whole matter with him in an
                            understanding and sympathetic spirit.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I took occasion to say that I trusted he would not
                            consider it presumptuous if I were to express my hope that he would not
                            be made to bear the responsibility for this misunderstanding, for which
                            it seemed to me that he was not at all to blame. He thanked me rather
                            warmly, and proceeded to say that he felt his own conscience was clear
                            and would not be greatly concerned about the personal consequences in
                            comparison with the wider issues involved. I added that while he and we
                            were alike clear in our consciences about the matter, it would be all
                            the more regrettable if any injustice to him were to follow from his
                            effort to further the views on this question which we had advocated in
                            the interest of both countries.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: In reading the <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi> of April 14, 1924, I find
                            that the letter I addressed to you on April 10, a copy of which you sent
                            to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Immigration, was made a
                            subject of discussion in the Senate. In the <hi rend="italic">Record</hi> it is reported that some of the Senators expressed the
                            opinion, which was apparently accepted by many other members of that
                            body, that my letter contained “a veiled threat.” As it appears from the
                                <hi rend="italic">Record</hi> that it is the phrase “grave
                            consequences”, which I used in the concluding part of my letter that
                            some of the Senators construed as “a veiled threat”, I may be permitted
                            to quote here full text of the sentence which contained the words in
                            question.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Relying upon the confidence you have been good enough to show me at
                                all times, I have stated or rather repeated all this to you very
                                candidly and in a most friendly spirit, for I realize, as I believe
                                you do, the grave consequences which the enactment of the measure
                                retaining that particular provision would inevitably bring upon the
                                otherwise happy and mutually advantageous relations between our two
                                countries.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Frankly, I must say I am unable to understand how the two words, read in
                            their context, could be construed as meaning anything like a threat. I
                            simply tried to emphasize the most unfortunate and deplorable effect
                            upon our traditional friendship which might result from the adoption of
                            a particular clause in the proposed measure. It would seriously impair
                            the good and mutually helpful relationship and disturb the spirit of
                            mutual regard and confidence, which characterizes our intercourse of the
                            last three quarters of a century and which was considerably strengthened
                            by the Washington Conference as well as by the most magnanimous sympathy
                            shown by your people in the recent calamity in my country. Whereas there
                            is otherwise every promise of hearty cooperation between Japan and the
                            United States, which is believed to be essential to the welfare not only
                            of themselves, but of the rest of the world, it would create, or at
                            least tend to create, an unhappy atmosphere of ill-feeling and misgiving
                            over the relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>As the representative of my country, whose supreme duty is to maintain
                            and if possible to draw still closer the bond of friendship so happily
                            existing between our two peoples, I honestly believe such effects, as I
                            have described, to be “grave consequences.” In using <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0476"/>these words, which I did quite
                            ingenuously, I had no thought of being in any way disagreeable or
                            discourteous, and still less of conveying “a veiled threat.” On the
                            contrary it was in a spirit of the most sincere respect, confidence, and
                            candor that I used these words, which spirit I hope is manifest
                            throughout my entire letter, for it was in that spirit that I wrote you.
                            I never suspected that these words, used as I used them, would ever
                            afford an occasion for such comment or interpretation as have been given
                            them.</p>
                        <p>You know, I am sure, that nothing could be further from my thought than
                            to give cause for offence to your people or their Government, and I have
                            not the slightest doubt that you have no such misunderstanding as to
                            either the spirit in which I wrote the letter in question to you or the
                            meaning I intended for the phrase that I used therein.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of what has transpired in the course of the public
                            discussion in the Senate, I feel constrained to write you, as a matter
                            of record, that I did not use the phrase in question in such a sense as
                            has been attributed to it.</p>

                        <p>The Japanese Ambassador called at six o’clock and left with the Secretary
                            a memorandum of the expression “grave consequences” used in his former
                            note which was transmitted by the Secretary to the Senate Committee. The
                            Ambassador said that if the Secretary decided to publish the note he
                            would be glad to be advised so that he could inform his Government and
                            he hoped that if the Secretary did decide to publish the note he would
                            make a reply which could be published at the same time. The Secretary
                            expressed his appreciation. The Secretary said that he had not any idea
                            that the Ambassador had intended a threat by the language used in the
                            former note. The Secretary said that, when he had received the note and
                            read the last paragraph, for a moment his attention was at once arrested
                            by the use of the words “grave consequences”, but as he read the context
                            he thought he saw clearly what the Ambassador meant in his allusion to
                            the effect on the otherwise happy and mutually advantageous relations of
                            the two countries. The Secretary felt quite sure that the Ambassador did
                            not intend any threat and was very sorry that such a construction had
                            been placed upon his language. The Ambassador again said that such an
                            interpretation had not entered his mind.</p>

                            receive your letter of the seventeenth instant with your frank and
                            friendly explanation of the intent of your recent note in relation to
                            the pending Immigration Bill. It gives me pleasure to be able to assure
                            you that reading the words “grave consequences” in the light of their
                            context, and knowing the spirit of friendship and understanding you have
                            always manifested in our long association, I had no doubt that these
                            words were to be taken in the sense you have stated, and I was quite
                            sure that it was far from your thought to express or imply any threat. I
                            am happy to add that I have deeply appreciated your constant desire to
                            promote the most cordial relations between the peoples of the two
                            countries.</p>

                        <p>79. With but few exceptions, Japanese press comment on the exclusion
                            question is now maintaining dignified tone marked by an absence of the
                            abuse which has characterized similar crises in the past but expressing
                            the keenest regret and disappointment. Indicative of the present
                            Japanese attitude of hopeful waiting are the resolutions passed
                            separately yesterday by the leading political parties after consultation
                            among leaders regretting the situation created by the Senate action but
                            united in expressions of hope that in some way remedial action will be
                            taken. The Seiyukai, the principal party of the opposition, while
                            subscribing to these views, forwarded a separate resolution to the
                            Foreign Office declaring the Government responsible for the present
                            state of affairs. The joint resolution of the 15 principal Tokyo
                            newspapers published this morning was likewise marked by a tone of
                            restraint. It expressed the belief that the excluding vote did not
                            represent the principles of the majority of the American people; that it
                            was highly painful to contemplate any circumstance that would tend to
                            weaken Japanese-American friendship, and that Japan was watching
                            developments in America with the keenest interest. This afternoon Dr.
                            Soyeda, president of the Japanese Emigration Society, left with me a
                            resolution adopted by the society, expressing similar sentiments.</p>

                        <p>Despite the mildness of these resolutions and the tone of restraint in
                            which the various comments have been couched, it would be entirely
                            erroneous to assume that Japan is already resigned to the situation or
                            to underestimate the bitterness of the feeling of her resentment over an
                            act which rankles all the more because it is realized that if this
                            exclusion legislation is enacted, there is no recourse or redress.</p>

                        <p>80. Minister of Foreign Affairs sent his private secretary to see me
                            yesterday afternoon to say that he was sorry to hear that a news
                            despatch had been telegraphed to the United States by American press
                            correspondents purporting to report that following a decision reached
                            yesterday at a meeting of the Cabinet, instructions had been sent to
                            Hanihara “to use every proper means possible to induce President
                            Coolidge to exercise his veto power when the immigration bill carrying
                            Japanese exclusion clause finally reaches him for action.” Baron Matsui
                            asks me to let you know this report is “entirely false and misleading”
                            because he fears otherwise that an erroneous impression might be created
                            in the American press that the Japanese were attempting to interfere in

                        <p>For consideration President Coolidge. The America-Japan Society, which
                            has always taken the deepest interest in maintaining the friendly
                            relation between the United States and Japan, hereby appeals to the
                            President and through him to the members of Congress and the American
                            people, for, should the discriminatory clause in the immigration bill be
                            passed in the Congress, the friendly and amicable relation existing
                            between the two countries ever since the opening of Japan will be
                            seriously jeopardized and bring about a most lamentable result. While we
                            understand fully the necessity of restricting the number of alien
                            immigrants to the United States for her national welfare and are willing
                            to submit to any restriction if applied to all <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0479"/>nations alike, we do ask your
                            consideration on the discrimination clause which is a great and
                            important question for Japan’s honor. Therefore, we earnestly request
                            you will endeavor to postpone the passage of the discriminative clause
                            for the moment and find some method by which to solve this perplexing
                            problem reasonably and satisfactorily for the two countries.</p>

                            personal visit against the pending Japanese exclusion bill. These
                            protests come from groups and organizations of varied character,
                            educational, religious, social, political, commercial, industrial,

                            referred to the Secretary’s suggestion that there should be an amendment
                            to the Immigration Bill so as to make an exception of “an alien entitled
                            to enter the United States under the provisions of the treaty”, and to
                            the modification of this by the House Committee as stated on pages two
                            and three of the House Committee’s report as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“An alien entitled to enter the United States solely to carry on
                                    trade under and in pursuance of the provisions of the present

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he had been instructed by his Government to take up
                            the question with the Secretary not by way of formal written
                            representations but to indicate the view of his Government <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0480"/>that this clause was not adequate to
                            preserve the rights accorded by the treaty. The Ambassador referred to
                            Article 1 of the treaty and to the first clause: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The citizens or subjects of each of the High Contracting Parties
                                    shall have liberty to enter, travel and reside in the

                                    retail,” etc.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that in view of what had taken place at the time of
                            the negotiation of the Treaty of 1911 his Government were of the opinion
                            that this part of the Treaty should be read as though there were a comma
                            after the words “in the territories of the other”, in other words that
                            the clause gave an independent right “to enter, travel and reside”
                            irrespective of the carrying on of trade. The Ambassador referred to the
                            provision in Article 2 of the Treaty of 1894<note n="50" xml:id="d293fn50">Malloy, <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>,

                            providing that it should not affect the laws with regard to the
                            immigration of laborers and to the desire of Japan that this should be
                            suppressed in the Treaty of 1911. The Ambassador also referred to the
                            declaration which was signed at the same time as the Treaty of 1911,
                            stating that the Japanese Government was prepared to maintain the
                            control which they had exercised over the emigration of laborers to the
                            United States. The Ambassador said that in view of the negotiations it
                            was felt that the provision of Article 1 of the Treaty must be read as
                            though there were a comma after the words “in the territories of the
                            other,” so that the right to enter and reside was not qualified, while
                            on the other hand, the Japanese Government agreed to maintain its
                            regulations to prevent the emigration to the United States of
                            laborers.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he hardly cared to discuss so important a matter
                            as the construction of a treaty in an informal and casual way, as there
                            was great danger of a misunderstanding; that he was prepared, on proper
                            occasion, to state the views of this Government with regard to the
                            interpretation of the treaty. He hoped, however, that a situation
                            requiring such a discussion would not arise. In view of the statements
                            made by the Ambassador, the Secretary felt that he must state in a
                            general way the attitude of this Government in relation to the treaty,
                            for he was bound to say that he could not agree with the construction
                            which the Japanese Government seemed to place upon it. The Secretary
                            said that in saying this he was not at all altering the views that he
                            had expressed to the committees of Congress as to the policy to be
                            pursued, but of course the Ambassador must understand that if the
                            question of treaty obligation was brought up it would have to be
                            discussed from a legal standpoint.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he must call the attention of the Ambassador, in
                            the first place, to the actual content of the Immigration Bill, <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0481"/>to which the Ambassador had
                            referred, as passed by the House. The exception in relation to the
                            treaty was not the only exception; thus the Ambassador would find that
                            in Section 3 there were excepted governmental officials and their
                            families, etc, aliens visiting the United States as tourists or
                            temporarily for business or pleasure, aliens in continuous transit
                            through the United States, aliens lawfully admitted to the United States
                            who later go in transit from one part of the United States to enter
                            other foreign contiguous territory, and bona fide alien seamen as
                            stated. To these provisions were added the exception of aliens entitled
                            to enter the United States solely to carry on trade in pursuance of the
                            provisions of a present existing Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The
                            Secretary read these provisions to the Ambassador and said that, taken
                            as a whole, he could not admit that the Bill would establish any
                            violation of treaty provisions and that he could not discuss the matter
                            upon any such basis. The Secretary again stated that this did not affect
                            at all his friendly attitude and his desire that the matter should be
                            dealt with in a way that would maintain the most cordial relations
                            between the two countries, but that if the question of treaty violation
                            were raised it would be quite impossible for this Government to admit
                            that its obligations were not fully met.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then went on to say that while he did not wish to discuss
                            at length the construction of the provision of the treaty to which the
                            Ambassador had referred, he felt that it should be read as it stood and
                            if it were necessary to consider the function of a comma the fact could
                            not be overlooked that the comma was not there. The Secretary said,
                            however, that the question was far more fundamental than that. The
                            Secretary felt that an examination of the history of the negotiations
                            and of the attitude of this Government made it abundantly clear that it
                            was not at all the intention of this Government in making the Treaty of
                            1911 to surrender its control over immigration. This was a fundamental
                            sovereign right and it could not be regarded as given up by implication
                            or by anything short of explicit provisions. The Secretary said that
                            this was true of all commercial treaties; these treaties related to
                            intercourse between peoples. The control of immigration was essential to
                            self-protection and commercial treaties must be construed with this in
                            view. The Secretary called attention to the fact that the introduction
                            of immigrants, of settlers, of those who would become a permanent part
                            of the population of the country was a very serious matter. No nation
                            could be regarded as having surrendered the right to control such
                            immigration without an express provision to that effect. Such control
                            was consistent with the regulation of intercourse or with the sort of
                            intercourse that was incident to commercial relations. Our commercial
                            treaties should be read in this sense. <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0482"/>The Secretary said that he must again express the hope
                            that it would not be necessary for the two countries to discuss the
                            questions which had been raised from a standpoint of any charge of
                            violation of treaty in the proposed Bill, as he did not believe that
                            such a charge could properly be made.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador thanked the Secretary for his statement and said that he
                            understood the Secretary’s position.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then referred to a statement in the House Committee’s
                            report with regard to the Japanese treatment of Chinese and Koreans
                            which seemed to indicate that the view was held that the Japanese were
                            guilty of inconsistency. The Ambassador said that this was based upon a
                            misapprehension. He said that in fact the action taken by Japan had been
                            to reduce the restrictions that had previously been maintained as to
                            settlements and residences of foreigners rather than the reverse; in
                            other words, the Japanese had been lifting restrictions and modifying
                            them.</p>

                        <p>69. Conferees on the Immigration Bill have reported the measure with the
                            exclusion clause identical with the Johnson Bill retained, but with the
                            following additional proviso: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">Provided</hi>, That this subdivision shall not
                                    take effect as to exclusion until March 1, 1925, before which
                                    time the President is requested to negotiate with the Japanese
                                    Government in relation to the abrogation of the present
                                    arrangement on this subject.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is understood that the conferees’ report will be submitted to and
                            considered by the House today and in the Senate later, perhaps tomorrow.
                            If a point of order, which it is understood may be made against the
                            amendment, should be made and sustained it is possible that the bill

                        <p>70. Department’s 69 May 8, 6 P.M. The House late yesterday afternoon
                            recommitted the bill to the Committee of Conference, with instructions
                            to the conferees on the part of the House not to agree to the proviso
                            reported in the bill, and which is quoted in the Department’s telegram
                            above mentioned. A motion to recommit the bill without instructions to
                            the conferees was offered by Mr. Sabath, which motion was amended by a
                            motion by Mr. Raker to instruct the conferees as above indicated, the

                        <p>97. It may interest the Department to know that Ambassador Shidehara<note n="51" xml:id="d296fn51">Former Japanese Ambassador to the United
                                States.</note> has recently been taken from the waiting list and he,

                                the Japanese Embassy at Washington.</note> have been assigned to the

                            States on the immigration question.</p>
                        <p>In view of this fact, therefore, it is highly significant that, since the
                            announcement of the action of the congressional conferees, the Japanese
                            press in special articles dwell on the fact that the Foreign Office
                            regards the Morris-Shidehara draft<note n="53" xml:id="d296fn53">See

                        <p>It would seem from the press that suggestion on the part of the United

                            existing arrangements without compensation in the form of an assurance
                            that Japanese now resident in the United States would not be subjected
                            to discriminatory treatment, would be vigorously opposed.</p>

                        <p>72. Supplementing Department’s No. 70, May 10, noon. The Conferees on the
                            Immigration Bill on May 12 brought in a report recommending <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> adoption of the exclusion clause
                            substantially in the form embodied in the Johnson Bill, i. e., without
                            the proviso quoted in Department’s telegram No. 69, May 8, 6 p.m. It
                            seems probable that the Conference report will be adopted by both Houses
                            before the end of the week.</p>
                        <p>For your strictly confidential information and guidance in connection
                            with your No. 97, May 10. The apparent disposition of Congress at the
                            present and as it may be foreseen to remain indefinitely is to assert
                            complete legislative control over immigration matters. While it is
                            possible that this might prove consistent with the negotiation of a
                            treaty by which the United States and Japan would reciprocally establish
                            exclusion on the basis contemplated by the law which will doubtless soon
                            be enacted, it would seem that that represents the utmost limit to which
                            the Executive could safely go in adjusting or palliating the difficulty
                            with Japan created by the enactment of exclusion. It is in any case
                            practically certain that no arrangement on the basis of the
                            Morris-Shidehara draft could be expected to receive the necessary
                            ratification of the Senate. It is believed that Saburi fully understands
                            the situation hitherto existing in that regard, and you may find it
                            expedient to convey through him to the Japanese Government a discreet
                            intimation that recent political developments have made such a solution
                            more than ever out of the question, and that no useful purpose could be
                            served by proposing an arrangement which would so inevitably fail of
                            acceptance by the requisite two-thirds majority in the Senate.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">and requesting that I should advise you whether I know
                            of any objection to its approval, I beg to say:</p>
                        <p>The provisions of the bill which are of special interest to the
                            Department of State are (1) the administrative provisions, (2) those
                            defining the basis upon which the immigration quotas are to be
                            determined, and (3) the provision of Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) excluding aliens ineligible to citizenship, except as
                            stated.</p>
                        <p>The administrative provisions of the bill have been framed in
                            consultation with representatives of the Department of State and largely
                            embody the Department’s recommendations. I do not desire to interpose
                            any objection to the bill upon this score.</p>
                        <p>The census of 1890 is taken as the basis for determining the quotas of
                            immigrants. This has the effect of reducing the number of immigrants
                            from certain countries as compared with others, because of the smaller
                            number of their nationals embraced within the population of the United
                            States at the time of that census. Representations against this basis
                            upon the ground of discrimination were made by certain foreign
                            governments and were communicated by the Department of State to the
                            Committees of Congress. In view of the fact that Congress, in its
                            discretion, after full consideration has selected the basis stated in
                            the bill, I do not desire to urge the objection further.</p>
                        <p>Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) providing for the exclusion of
                            aliens ineligible to citizenship affects especially the Japanese
                            inasmuch as Section 25 of the bill continues the exclusion provisions of
                            prior enactments which cover immigration from China and from the Eastern
                            areas falling within the so-called barred zone. Since 1908 there has
                            been an understanding with Japan, evidenced by communications between
                            the Department of State and the Japanese Government, called the
                            “Gentlemen’s Agreement”, under which Japan has undertaken to limit the
                            immigration into the United States of laborers. Through this arrangement
                            this Government has had the benefit of coöperation with Japan in
                            excluding such immigrants. It is believed that Japan <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0486"/>has faithfully performed her voluntary
                            undertaking. From the reports of the Commissioner General of Immigration
                            it appears that for the fifteen years after the Gentlemen’s Agreement
                            was made, 1908 to 1923, taking the total admissions and departures of
                            Japanese, including tourists, students, professional persons, merchants,
                            et cetera, there was an excess of admissions over departures in
                            continental United States of only 8,681 Japanese, or an average annual
                            increase in Japanese population, through immigration, of 578. In seven
                            of the fifteen years there was a net decrease, and in eight of the
                            fifteen years a net increase. The greatest net increase in any one year
                            was in 1917 to 1918 when it amounted to 3,452. In the last three years
                            there has been a net decrease. In the year 1921–22 this net decrease
                            amounted to 2, 192. It may further be observed that in 1919 when this
                            Government brought to the attention of the Japanese Government the
                            bringing over of so-called “picture brides” to the United States the
                            Japanese Government undertook to issue no passports for continental
                            United States to women falling within this description.</p>
                        <p>Hawaii was not included in the Gentlemen’s Agreement as the Governor of
                            Hawaii did not desire to have it included, but the Japanese Government
                            undertook to apply the same rules to those islands until notified that a
                            labor shortage existed there. From the report of the Commissioner
                            General of Immigration it appears for the fifteen years, 1908–1923,
                            there was a net increase in the Japanese population in Hawaii, through
                            immigration, of 6903 or an average net increase of 460. In six of the
                            fifteen years there was a net increase, and the largest net increase in
                            any one year was in the year 1912–1913 of 2108.</p>
                        <p>Further, the Japanese Government has expressed its readiness to discuss
                            with this Govermnent modifications of the Gentlemen’s Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Under the present bill, without Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>),
                            the quota which would be available to Japan on the basis of the census
                            of 1890 would be 100 (Section 11 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>). And even
                            the admission of this small number would be controlled by the operation
                            of the Gentlemen’s Agreement.</p>
                        <p>It thus appears, in my opinion, that the exclusion provision of Section
                            13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) is entirely unnecessary, and indeed, by
                            the loss of the coöperation of Japan through the abrogation of the
                            Gentlemen’s Agreement, it will probably facilitate the surreptitious
                            entry of Japanese so that the result of this provision of the bill will
                            probably be to increase rather than to diminish the actual Japanese
                            immigration.</p>
                        <p>While this exclusion provision, from the standpoint of the restriction of
                            immigration, is deemed to be unnecessary, it unquestionably <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0487"/>will be resented by Japan. The Japanese
                            Government has not questioned the sovereign power of the United States
                            to control immigration but has sought to attain the desired result
                            through cooperation and friendly arrangements with our Government. It is
                            most unfortunate, from the standpoint of our foreign relations and
                            especially in view of the attitude taken by Japan at the Conference on
                            the Limitation of Armament held at Washington, and the spirit of
                            friendship and mutual confidence then evoked, that the question of
                            immigration of Japanese should not have been left to be dealt with by
                            satisfactory mutual agreement, which could have been entered into
                            without derogating in the slightest degree from our full authority to
                            act if any exigency requiring such action should at any time arise.</p>
                        <p>I elaborated these views in communications addressed to the committees of
                            Congress and the questions involved have been fully discussed in my
                            interviews with you in relation to the pending measure. If the exclusion
                            provision of Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) stood alone I should
                            unhesitatingly recommend its disapproval. It is fully realized, however,
                            that the bill before you is a comprehensive immigration measure of which
                            the provision in question is only a part, and that it is necessary for
                            you to consider the policy represented by the bill as a whole, the
                            necessity of an immigration measure to take the place of the existing
                            law which expires on June thirtieth, and also the preponderant sentiment
                            expressed in Congress. For this reason I return the bill without
                            recommendation.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador called at the Secretary’s request.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he desired to speak of the Immigration Bill which
                            had been passed by both Houses of Congress and was now before the
                            President. The Secretary called attention to the efforts which he had
                            made and which the President had made to secure the elimination or
                            modification of the provision relating to the exclusion of aliens
                            ineligible for citizenship. The Secretary said that despite these
                            efforts the overwhelming opinion of Congress was in favor of the
                            retention of the provision. This was not due to a lack of friendship on
                            the part of the American people toward the Japanese people. That
                            friendship and cordial interest had been abundantly demonstrated. It was
                            due to the strong sentiment in <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0488"/>Congress that the question of immigration should not be dealt with by
                            international agreements or understandings but by legislation enacted by
                            Congress. Congress was intent upon asserting its prerogative in this
                            matter and had rejected all overtures of the President and the Secretary
                            for securing opportunity for mutually satisfactory agreements by which
                            the question of admission could be dealt with.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wished to call the attention of the Ambassador
                            to the exact situation with which the President was now confronted. The
                            exclusion provision was not before him as a separate matter. If it were,
                            the President would unhesitatingly disapprove it. But this exclusion
                            provision was part of a comprehensive immigration bill. While the
                            Secretary believed that there was strong sentiment throughout the
                            country supporting the position taken by the President and the Secretary
                            as to the exclusion provision, it was also true that there was a very
                            strong sentiment demanding general legislation in restriction of
                            immigration. The Bill was a comprehensive measure dealing in great
                            detail with this subject and providing the necessary administrative
                            machinery. It was necessary that legislation should be passed of this
                            sort before the expiration of the present law on June 30th. It was
                            necessary that such legislation should be passed well in advance of that
                            date so that instructions could be given to consuls. If the President
                            disapproved this measure there would be great confusion and the most
                            serious difficulties might result. On the other hand, the sentiment in
                            Congress was so strong, as the Ambassador had observed from the votes
                            already taken, that there was very little doubt but that if the bill
                            were vetoed, it would be passed over the veto, and no good would have
                            resulted but there would be considerable bitterness and probably
                            acrimonious debate. The President felt in view of all these
                            considerations that he could not properly disapprove the Bill. But he
                            desired that the Japanese Government should know that his approval of
                            the Bill did not imply any change in his sentiment with regard to this
                            provision or any lack of cordial feeling toward Japan. The President had
                            fully endorsed the position the Secretary had taken.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the retirement of Ambassador Woods; that
                            this was not due to the immigration question but solely to the illness
                            of his wife’s mother. The Ambassador emphasized strongly the high esteem
                            in which Ambassador Woods was held by the Government and people of
                            Japan. …</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed his appreciation of what the Secretary had said.
                            He said that he could understand the Secretary’s <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0489"/>view and that he would try to make it
                            clear to his Government, but that while the Foreign Office might
                            appreciate the difficulties of the situation, he was quite sure that the
                            Japanese people would not understand it and would be greatly
                            disappointed. The Japanese people were now basing their hope upon the
                            President’s action and if the President approved the Bill it would cause
                            the keenest disappointment. The Ambassador hoped that there would be no
                            disorder but feared that there would be violent manifestations of that
                            disappointment. The Ambassador said that he would try to explain the
                            matter and thanked the Secretary for the information he had given.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked if the President would make a statement in
                            connection with the approval of the Bill. The Secretary said that he did
                            not know, and asked the Ambassador whether he thought a statement would
                            do any good. The Ambassador said that he did not know, but merely asked
                            for information. The Ambassador said that there had been reports in the
                            press that the President might send the Bill back with a recommendation
                            as to the exclusion provision. The Secretary said that this would serve
                            no useful purpose; that the President had talked fully and earnestly
                            with the representatives of the House and the Senate and had made
                            certain suggestions; that these suggestions had been modified and
                            limited and in this form had been proposed and accepted by the
                            Conference Committee; that then the Conference Committee had reported to
                            both Houses and these had turned down the suggestions by overwhelming
                            votes. It would not be of any use for the President to renew a
                            recommendation upon this point as to which both Houses of Congress had
                            taken a determined position. The Ambassador asked the Secretary when it
                            was likely that the President would approve the Bill and the Secretary
                            said that he could not say, but that he thought in the very near
                            future.</p>

                        <p>82. Supplementing Department’s No. 81, May 26, noon. The following is the
                            text of the public statement issued by the President in reference to his
                            approval of the Immigration Bill: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In signing this Bill, which in its main features I heartily
                                    approve, I regret the impossibility of severing from it the
                                    exclusion provision which, in the light of existing law, affects
                                    especially the Japanese. I gladly recognize that the enactment
                                    of this provision does not imply any change in our sentiment of
                                    admiration and cordial friendship for the Japanese people, a
                                    sentiment which has had and will continue to have abundant
                                    manifestation. The Bill rather expresses the determination of
                                    the Congress to exercise its prerogative in defining by
                                    legislation the control of immigration instead of leaving it to
                                    international arrangements. It should be noted that the Bill
                                    excepts from the exclusion provision government officials, those
                                    coming to this country as tourists or temporarily for business
                                    or pleasure, those in transit, seamen, those already resident
                                    here and returning from temporary absences, professors,
                                    ministers of religion, students, and those who enter solely to
                                    carry on trade in pursuance of existing treaty provisions. But
                                    we have had for many years an understanding with Japan by which
                                    the Japanese Government has voluntarily undertaken to prevent
                                    the emigration of laborers to the United States, and in view of
                                    this historic relation and of the feeling which inspired it, it
                                    would have been much better in my judgment, and more effective
                                    in the actual control of immigration, if we had continued to
                                    invite the cooperation which Japan was ready to give and had
                                    thus avoided creating any ground for misapprehension by an
                                    unnecessary statutory enactment. That course would not have
                                    derogated from the authority of the Congress to deal with the
                                    question in any exigency requiring its action. There is scarcely
                                    any ground for disagreement as to the result we want, but this
                                    method of securing it is unnecessary and deplorable at this
                                    time. If the exclusion provision stood alone I should disapprove
                                    it without hesitation, if sought in this way at this time. But
                                    this Bill is a comprehensive measure dealing with the whole
                                    subject of immigration and setting up the necessary
                                    administrative machinery. The present Quota Act, of 1921, will
                                    terminate on June 30th next. It is of great importance that a
                                    comprehensive measure should take its place, and that the
                                    arrangements for its administration should be provided at once
                                    in order to avoid hardship and confusion. I must therefore
                                    consider the Bill as a whole, and the imperative need of the
                                    country for legislation of this general character. For this
                                    reason the Bill is approved.”</p>

                        <p>122. Baron Matsui requested me informally this morning to say to you that
                            he hopes that the President if he signs the immigration bill will find
                            it possible to issue an explanatory statement covering the Japanese
                            clause as the Japanese people are still counting on him to veto the
                            measure and if he does not are going to be bitterly disappointed and he
                            believes that such a statement coming from the President would somewhat
                            relieve the tension that is sure to arise when news of his signing the
                            bill reaches here.</p>

                        <p>125. The news that the President has signed the immigration bill aroused
                            the deepest resentment and bitterness here as was expected. This morning
                            the press contains very caustic comments. The statement issued by the
                            President has tended to lessen the resentment in some measure but from
                            the extent of the bitterness shown it is apparent that the Japanese,
                            including those in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for some
                            unexplainable reason had never abandoned hope that the bill would be
                            vetoed.</p>
                        <p>I am assured, however, both by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by
                            Baron Shidehara that the Government is making every effort to prevent
                            popular outbreaks and to allay public feeling. They do not think,
                            therefore, that any anti-American demonstrations will take place.</p>

                            Government, I have the honor to present to you herewith a memorandum
                            enunciating the position of Japan on the subject of the discriminatory
                            provisions against Japanese which are embodied in Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the Immigration Act of 1924, approved May

                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Japanese Government are deeply concerned by the enactment in the
                                United States of an act entitled the ‘Immigration Act of 1924’.
                                While the measure was under discussion in the Congress they took the
                                earliest opportunity to invite the attention of the American
                                Government to a discriminatory clause embodied in the Act, namely
                                Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), which provides for the
                                exclusion of aliens ineligible to citizenship, in contradistinction
                                to other classes of aliens, and which is manifestly intended to
                                apply to Japanese. Neither the representations of the Japanese
                                Government, nor the recommendations of the President and of the
                                Secretary of State were heeded by the Congress, and the clause in
                                question has now been written into the statutes of the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>It is, perhaps, needless to state that international discriminations
                                in any form and on any subject, even if based on purely economic
                                reasons, are opposed to the principles of justice and fairness upon
                                which the friendly intercourse between nations must, in its final
                                analysis, depend. To these very principles the doctrine of equal
                                opportunity now widely recognized, with the unfailing support of the
                                United States, owes its being. Still more unwelcome are
                                discriminations based on race. The strong condemnation of such
                                practice evidently inspired the American Government in 1912 in
                                denouncing the commercial treaty between the United States and
                                Russia, pursuant to the resolution of the House of Representatives
                                of December 13, 1911, as a protest against the unfair and unequal
                                treatment of aliens of a particular race in Russia.<note n="58" xml:id="d306fn58">See <ref target="frus1911#pg_695"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1911, pp.
                                        695</ref>–<ref target="frus1911#pg_699">699</ref>.</note>
                                Yet discrimination of a similar character is expressed by the new
                                statute of the United States. The Immigration Act of 1924,
                                considered in the light of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the
                                naturalization laws, clearly establishes the rule that the
                                admissibility of aliens to the United States rests not upon
                                individual merits or qualifications, but upon the division of race
                                to which applicants belong. In particular, it appears that such
                                racial distinction in the Act is directed essentially against
                                Japanese, since persons of other Asiatic races are <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0493"/>excluded under separate enactments
                                of prior dates, as is pointed out in the published letter of the
                                Secretary of State of February 8, 1924, to the Chairman of the
                                Committee on Immigration and Naturalization of the House of
                                    Representatives.<note n="59" xml:id="d306fn59"><ref target="frus1924v01#pg_214">Vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 214</ref>.</note></p>
                            <p>It has been repeatedly asserted in defence of these discriminatory
                                measures in the United States that persons of the Japanese race are
                                not assimilable to American life and ideals. It will however be
                                observed, in the first place, that few immigrants of a foreign stock
                                may well be expected to assimilate themselves to their new
                                surroundings within a single generation. The history of Japanese
                                immigration to the United States in any appreciable number dated but
                                from the last few years of the nineteenth century. The period of
                                time is too short to permit of any conclusive judgment being passed
                                upon the racial adaptabilities of those immigrants in the matter of
                                assimilation, as compared with alien settlers of the races classed
                                as eligible to American citizenship.</p>
                            <p>It should further be remarked that the process of assimilation can
                                thrive only in a genial atmosphere of just and equitable treatment.
                                Its natural growth is bound to be hampered under such a pressure of
                                invidious discriminations as that to which Japanese residents in
                                some states of the American Union have been subjected, at law and in
                                practice, for nearly twenty years. It seems hardly fair to complain
                                of the failure of foreign elements to merge in a community, while
                                the community chooses to keep them apart from the rest of its
                                membership. For these reasons the assertion of Japanese
                                non-assimilability seems at least premature, if not fundamentally
                                unjust.</p>

                            <p>The foregoing history will show that throughout these negotiations,
                                one of the chief preoccupations of the Japanese Government was to
                                protect their nationals from discriminatory immigration legislation
                                in the United States. That position of Japan was fully understood
                                and appreciated by the American Government, and it was with these
                                considerations in view that the existing Treaty was signed and the
                                exchange of its ratifications effected. In this situation, while
                                reserving for another occasion the presentation of the question of
                                legal technicality, whether and how far the provisions of Section 13
                                    (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the Immigration Act of 1924 are
                                inconsistent with the terms of the Treaty of 1911, the Japanese
                                Government desire now to point out that the new legislation is in
                                entire disregard of the spirit and circumstances that underlie the
                                conclusion of the Treaty.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the so-called ‘Gentlemen’s Agreement’ it will be
                                recalled that it was designed on the one hand, to meet the actual
                                requirements of the situation as perceived by the American
                                Government, concerning Japanese immigration, and, on the other, to
                                provide against the possible demand in the United States for a
                                statutory exclusion which would offend the just susceptibilities of
                                the Japanese people. The arrangement came into force in 1908. Its
                                efficiency has been proved in fact. The figures given in the Annual
                                Report of the United States Commissioner General of Immigration
                                authoritatively show that during the fifteen years from 1908 to
                                1923, the excess, in number, of Japanese admitted to continental
                                United States, over those who departed was no more than 8681
                                altogether,— including not only immigrants of the laboring class,
                                but also merchants, students, and other non-laborers and
                                non-immigrants, the numbers which naturally increased with the
                                growth of commercial, intellectual, and social relations between the
                                two countries. If even so limited a number should in any way be
                                found embarrassing to the United States, the Japanese Government
                                have already manifested their readiness to revise the existing
                                arrangement with a view to further limitation of emigration.</p>
                            <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0495"/>
                            <p>Unfortunately, however, the sweeping provisions of the new act,
                                clearly indicative of discrimination against Japanese, have made it
                                impossible for Japan to continue the undertakings assumed under the
                                Gentlemen’s Agreement. An understanding of friendly co-operation
                                reached after long and comprehensive discussions between the
                                Japanese and American Governments has thus been abruptly overthrown
                                by legislative action on the part of the United States. The patient,
                                loyal, and scrupulous observance by Japan for more than sixteen
                                years, of these self-denying regulations, in the interest of good
                                relations between the two countries, now seems to have been
                                wasted.</p>
                            <p>It is not denied that, fundamentally speaking, it lies within the
                                inherent sovereign power of each state to limit and control
                                immigration to its own domains, but when, in the exercise of such
                                right, an evident injustice is done to a foreign nation in disregard
                                of its proper self-respect, of international understandings or of
                                ordinary rules of comity, the question necessarily assumes an aspect
                                which justifies diplomatic discussion and adjustment.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, the Japanese Government consider it their duty to
                                maintain and to place on record their solemn protest against the
                                discriminatory clause in Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of
                                the Immigration Act of 1924 and to request the American Government
                                to take all possible and suitable measures for the removal of such
                                discrimination.”</p>

                            way of protest at the passage of the Immigration Bill containing the
                            exclusion provision. The Ambassador said he hoped the Secretary would
                            appreciate the friendly spirit in which he presented it. He emphasized
                            the fact that his Government fully understood the position which the
                            Secretary had taken and were gratified at the statement made by the
                            President in relation to the exclusion provision.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated his desire by which he had been animated
                            throughout the conduct of his office, to promote the most cordial
                            friendship between the two peoples and the other Governments. The
                            Secretary said that he would continue his work in the same spirit. The
                            Ambassador again expressed his appreciation and said this feeling was
                            reciprocated.</p>
                        <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0496"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not care to comment upon the note but he
                            would refer informally to two or three phases of the matter. In the
                            first place it should be noted that the exclusion provision was not to
                            go into effect until the thirtieth of June. It was, therefore, not in
                            effect as a law at this time and there would be opportunity before it
                            came into force for the Department of State to communicate with the
                            Japanese Government formally the fact that it had been enacted and that
                            the Japanese Government was released from further application under the
                            Gentlemen’s Agreement. The Secretary pointed out that this was a
                            unilateral arrangement, and not bi-lateral, and that it required no
                            united action to deal with it. The Secretary, however, said that as a
                            matter of courtesy there would be opportunity before the new law went
                            into effect to give the notice as already stated. The Secretary called
                            attention further to the fact that at the time the Treaty of 1911 was
                            negotiated this Government had stated distinctly that it reserved all
                            its rights with respect to the control of immigration and that this was
                            fully understood by the Japanese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that so far as the point of discrimination was
                            concerned it should be borne in mind that the Bill related to aliens who
                            were not eligible to citizenship; that the point of discrimination,
                            which did not apply solely to the Japanese but to the orientals
                            generally, was that they did not come within the classes of aliens who
                            were entitled to naturalization under our laws. The point of distinction
                            was thus made by our naturalization laws which had long been in
                            existence. This was quite apart from any question of the ability or
                            character of a particular race, but that Congress had not desired to
                            facilitate the introduction of those who were not eligible to
                            citizenship under our laws. The Secretary again referred to the fact
                            that under our naturalization laws this distinction was of long
                            standing.</p>

                        <p>130. Due to the attitude of the Government as set forth in the last
                            paragraph of my 125, May 28, 4 p.m., there have been no popular
                            anti-American outbreaks but this does not signify that there has been
                            any lessening of deep-seated resentment and bitterness throughout Japan.
                            The nation can be considered to be behind the Government in any protest
                            they may make at Washington and it would <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0497"/>be a mistake to interpret their protest as actuated by

                            given overmuch prominence to the recent Japanese protest on exclusion
                            and their comments are confined to entire approval of the Government’s
                            action and express satisfaction that Japan has based her protest on the
                            spirit underlying the treaty rather than upon legal technicalities. The
                            tone of the press while giving in no way any indication of resignation
                            tends to confirm the belief that there is a general realization here now
                            of the fact that no immediate action favorable to Japan can be expected;
                            also that violence looking to this end could have no beneficial result;
                            and that Japan’s best course under the circumstances is to adopt an
                            attitude of restraint in the discussion of the situation hoping in this
                            way to effect a change favorable to Japan through appeals to the sense
                            of fair play of the American people realizing at the same time that this
                            course will be most profitable to Japan through its beneficial effect on
                            world opinion coming as it does at time when general outbreaks of
                            violence might have well been expected.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime today’s press reports two more suicides in protest
                            against exclusion and the growth of the movement for the boycotting of
                            American goods while unlikely to prove very serious to American trade
                            relations nevertheless are indicative of the extent of the bitterness
                            felt.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note under date of May 31st containing a memorandum
                            stating the position of the Japanese Government with respect to the
                            provision of Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the Immigration
                            Act of 1924. I take pleasure in noting your reference to the
                            friendliness and candor in which your communication has been made and
                            you may be assured of the <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0498"/>readiness of this Government to consider in the same spirit the views
                            you have set forth.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the signing of the Immigration Bill, the President issued
                            a statement, a copy of which I had the privilege of handing to you,
                            gladly recognizing the fact that the enactment of this provision “does
                            not imply any change in our sentiment of admiration and cordial
                            friendship for the Japanese people, a sentiment which has had and will
                            continue to have abundant manifestation.” Permit me to state briefly the
                            substance of the provision. Section 13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                            related to all aliens ineligible to citizenship. It establishes certain
                            exceptions, and to these classes the exclusion provision does not apply,
                            to wit: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Those who are not immigrants as defined in Section 3 of the Act,

                            into account, the provision in question does not differ greatly in its
                            practical operation, or in the policy which it reflects, from the
                            understanding <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0499"/>embodied in the
                            Gentlemen’s Agreement under which the Japanese Government has cooperated
                            with the Government of the United States in preventing the emigration of
                            Japanese laborers to this country. We fully and gratefully appreciate
                            the assistance which has thus been rendered by the Japanese Government
                            in the carrying out of this long established policy and it is not deemed
                            to be necessary to refer to the economic considerations which have
                            inspired it. Indeed, the appropriateness of that policy, which has not
                            evidenced any lack of esteem for the Japanese people, their character
                            and achievements, has been confirmed rather than questioned by the
                            voluntary action of your Government in aiding its execution.</p>
                        <p>The point of substantial difference between the existing arrangement and
                            the provision of the Immigration Act is that the latter has expressed,
                            as the President has stated, “the determination of the Congress to
                            exercise its prerogative in defining by legislation the control of
                            immigration instead of leaving it to international arrangements.” It is
                            not understood that this prerogative is called in question, but, rather,
                            your Government expressly recognizes that “it lies within the inherent
                            sovereign power of each state to limit and control immigration to its
                            own domains,” an authority which it is believed the Japanese Government
                            has not failed to exercise in its own discretion with respect to the
                            admission of aliens and the conditions and location of their settlement
                            within its borders. While the President would have preferred to continue
                            the existing arrangement with the Japanese Government, and to have
                            entered into negotiations for such modifications as might seem to be
                            desirable, this Government does not feel that it is limited to such an
                            international arrangement or that by virtue of the existing
                            understanding, or of the negotiations which it has conducted in the past
                            with the Japanese Government, it has in any sense lost or impaired the
                            full liberty of action which it would otherwise have in this matter. On
                            the contrary, that freedom with respect to the control of immigration,
                            which is an essential element of sovereignty and entirely compatible
                            with the friendly sentiments which animate our international relations,
                            this Government in the course of these negotiations always fully
                            reserved.</p>
                        <p>Thus in the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation concluded with Japan in
                            1894 it was expressly stipulated in Article II: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is, however, understood that the stipulations contained in

                                    laws, ordinances or regulations with regard to trade, the
                                    immigration of laborers, police and public security which are in
                                    force or which may hereafter be enacted in either of the two
                                    countries.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is true that at the time of the negotiation of the treaty of 1911 the
                            Japanese Government desired that the provision above quoted <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0500"/>should be eliminated and that this
                            Government acquiesced in that proposal in view of the fact that the
                            Japanese Government had, in 1907–8, by means of the Gentlemen’s
                            Agreement, undertaken such measures of restriction as it was anticipated
                            would prove adequate to prevent any substantial increase in the number
                            of Japanese laborers in the United States. In connection with the treaty
                            revision of 1911, the Japanese Government renewed this undertaking in
                            the form of a Declaration attached to the Treaty. In acquiescing in this
                            procedure, however, this Government was careful to negative any
                            intention to derogate from the full right to exercise in its discretion
                            control over immigration. In view of the statements contained in your
                            communication with respect to these negotiations I feel that I should
                            refer to the exchange of views then had. You will recall that, in a
                            memorandum of October 19, 1910,<note n="65" xml:id="d310fn65">Not
                                printed.</note> suggesting a basis for the treaty revisions then in
                            contemplation the Japanese Embassy stated: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… The measures which the Imperial Government have enforced for
                                    the past two and a half years in regulation of the question of
                                    emigration of labourers to the United States, have, it is
                                    believed, proved entirely satisfactory and far more effective
                                    than any prohibition of immigration would have been. Those
                                    measures of restraint were undertaken voluntarily, in order to
                                    prevent any dispute or issue between the two Countries on the
                                    subject of labour immigration, and will be continued, it may be
                                    added, so long as the condition of things calls for such
                                    continuation.</p>
                                <p>“Accordingly, having in view the actual situation, the Imperial
                                    Government are convinced that the reservation in question is not
                                    only not necessary, but that it is an engagement which, if
                                    continued, is more liable to give rise to misunderstandings than
                                    to remove difficulties. In any case it is a stipulation which,
                                    not unnaturally, is distasteful to national sensibilities. In
                                    these circumstances the Imperial Government desire in the new
                                    treaty to suppress entirely the reservation above mentioned, and
                                    to leave, in word as well as in fact, the question to which it
                                    relates, for friendly adjustment between the two Governments
                                    independently of any conventional stipulations on the subject.
                                    In expressing that desire they are not unmindful of the
                                    difficulties under which the United States labour in the matter
                                    of immigration and they will accordingly, if so desired, be
                                    willing to make the proposed treaty terminable at any time upon
                                    six months’ notice.</p>

                                    termination clause the Contracting States would actually enjoy
                                    greater liberty of action so far as immigration is concerned,

                                (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>), to which you have referred, shall take
                            effect on July 1, 1924. Inasmuch as the abstention on the part of the
                            United States from such an exercise of its right of statutory control
                            over immigration was the condition upon which was predicated the
                            undertaking of the Japanese Government contained in the Gentlemen’s
                            Agreement of 1907–08 with respect to the regulation of the emigration of
                            laborers to the United States, I feel constrained to advise you that
                            this Government cannot but acquiesce in the view that the Government of
                            Japan is to be considered released, as from the date upon which Section
                            13 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the Immigration Act comes into force,
                            from further obligation by virtue of that understanding.</p>
                        <p>In saying this, I desire once more to emphasize the appreciation on the
                            part of this Government of the voluntary cooperation of your Government
                            in carrying out the Gentlemen’s Agreement and to express the conviction
                            that the recognition of the right of each Government to legislate in
                            control of immigration should not derogate in any degree from the mutual
                            goodwill and cordial friendship which have always characterized the
                            relations of the two countries.</p>

                            <p>As you are aware, a new Immigration Act recently passed the United
                                States Congress, and having been approved by the President, it has
                                been finally written into the statute-books of the country. As to
                                the genesis of this Act, you will recall that of late years in the
                                United States, immigration from foreign countries, especially from
                                Southern and Eastern Europe, has been showing a marked increase. It
                                has come to be generally believed that it will <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0503"/>be a matter of practical difficulty
                                to merge these foreign elements in the homogeneous community of
                                original Americans. It has accordingly been felt necessary to impose
                                a more rigorous restriction upon foreign immigration. As for the
                                emigration of Japanese laborers to the United States, an arrangement
                                popularly called the Gentlemen’s Agreement has long been in force.
                                Under that arrangement the Japanese Government has been exercising a
                                prohibitory control over the departure to the United States of all
                                classes of laborers except certain relatives of those living in the
                                United States and persons who are returning to that country after a
                                temporary visit to Japan. Consequently, the increase of new Japanese
                                immigrants in the United States has not been, in fact, of any
                                appreciable number. It is believed that the new Immigration Act was
                                originally intended to institute a rigorous restriction of
                                immigration in general, and that there was no reason for embodying
                                in the Act a provision designed specifically to exclude Japanese
                                immigrants. It is sincerely to be regretted that while the Bill was
                                under discussion in Congress, certain leaders of anti-Japanese
                                persuasions should have succeeded in putting through a clause to the
                                effect that aliens ineligible to citizenship should, as a rule, be
                                denied admission into the United States.</p>
                            <p>In reviewing the development of this question, there are three points
                                which engage our attention.</p>
                            <list>
                                <item>First, no intimation has lately been made, even by the
                                    exclusionists, of any inferiority of the Japanese race. Their
                                    contention is in effect that the Japanese are to the Americans
                                    what oil is to water. Neither oil nor water can be said to be
                                    superior or inferior to the other, but the fact is that in no
                                    case can oil dissolve and merge in water. In other words, they
                                    say, Japanese are unassimilable to American life, and the
                                    introduction of such alien elements will prove a source of
                                    danger to the United States. Such an argument formed one of the
                                    essential phases for the exclusion of Japanese; it was not on
                                    the ground of the inferiority of the Japanese race that the
                                    exclusion clause was adopted. It should, however, be pointed out
                                    that the plea of Japanese unassimilability is no more than an
                                    arbitrary presumption unsupported by any evidence of facts. Our
                                    views on this point have been already roughly set forth in the
                                    Note of May 31 last addressed by the Japanese Government to the
                                    Government of the United States.</item>
                                <item>Secondly, it has always been consistently maintained by the
                                    United States, that the liberty to limit and control immigration
                                    is one of the essential attributes of the inherent sovereign
                                    rights of each nation. The same argument was repeatedly invoked
                                    with special emphasis in the discussion of the exclusion clause.
                                    “We understand that the importance placed on this point by the
                                    United States is due to the <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0504"/>special conditions of that country. But we have
                                    no intention of calling this doctrine in question. The
                                    recognition, however, of such principle does not lead to any
                                    conclusion that the exclusion clause is in no respect repugnant
                                    to the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the
                                    United States.</item>
                                <item>Thirdly, it should be appreciated that the President and the
                                    Secretary of State of the United States have from the outset
                                    shown their opposition to the exclusion clause, and have made
                                    all possible efforts to have it eliminated from the Act. Public
                                    opinion in the United States, as reflected by a great section of
                                    the American press, also appears to be sympathetically disposed
                                    to Japan’s position in the matter. It is a significant fact that
                                    the legislation in question has met with uniform disapproval by
                                    many influential newspapers of the United States.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>Our protest against the exclusion clause is based upon the conviction
                                that a discriminatory treatment, as laid down in that clause, is
                                contrary to the dictates of justice and fairness, and is imposed
                                upon us in disregard of the ordinary rules of international comity.
                                The legislation is now an accomplished fact in the United States,
                                but we can by no means concede that the question is closed. Until
                                our just contentions shall have been given satisfaction, we shall
                                maintain our protest, and shall use our best possible endeavors to
                                seek an amicable adjustment of the question and to ensure forever
                                the traditional friendship between the two nations.</p>

                            Foreign Minister made today before the Diet a fair and judicious
                            statement regarding immigration question as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As for our relations with the United States, it is evident that

                                    Government on the subject. The question still remains
                                    unadjusted. It should however be remembered that a law cannot be
                                    modified except by law and that under the constitutional system
                                    of the United States the legislature is entirely independent of
                                    the Executive. It is obvious therefore that the continuance of
                                    discussions between the two Governments at this time will not in
                                    itself serve any useful purpose. What is really important in the
                                    final analysis of the question is that the American people shall
                                    come to have a correct understanding of our people and of our
                                    points of view. Impetuous mood or impassioned utterances will
                                    not conduce to international understanding. There is no doubt
                                    that the same love of justice that kindled American independence
                                    still continues to inspire the minds of the American people. The
                                    day will come when this fact will be fully demonstrated.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose herewith a
                            translation of a bill,<note n="71" xml:id="d314fn71">Not printed.</note>
                            which has recently passed both Houses of the Diet, amending the <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0506"/>Law of Nationality. This
                            measure represents an effort towards solving the question of dual
                            nationality, in which Japanese who have acquired foreign nationality by
                            reason of birth are involved.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the enclosed translation of Diet proceedings,<note n="72" xml:id="d314fn72">Not printed.</note> two bills relating to this
                            subject were introduced; one by the Government, and the other by the
                            Chairman of the Special Committee to which both bills were referred. The
                            latter bill was distinctly far-reaching. It sought to effect the
                            automatic cancellation of the Japanese nationality of Japanese who
                            acquired foreign nationality either by birth or naturalization. Due to
                            the particular opposition of the Army, which feared the provisions by
                            which persons could evade conscription by becoming naturalized in a
                            foreign country until after their thirty-seventh year, when they would
                            be no longer of military age, it was set aside in favor of the
                            Government bill. It did not, however, have much support at any time, as
                            it was too complete and abrupt a departure from the principle of blood,
                            which obtains in Japanese law.</p>
                        <p>The Law of Nationality, as it now stands, permits Japanese, who have
                            acquired foreign nationality by birth, to cancel, with the approval of
                            the Minister of the Interior, their Japanese nationality before reaching
                            their seventeenth year, when male subjects become liable for military
                            service. It will be noted that the bill which was adopted is not a full
                            acquiescence in “the principle of the sun”; for, while it provides that
                            those born in certain countries (to be designated by imperial
                                decree<note n="73" xml:id="d314fn73">By Imperial Ordinance No. 262,
                                Nov. 14, 1924, a translation of which was enclosed with the despatch
                                no. 17, Dec. 1, 1924, from the Ambassador in Japan, it was specified
                                that this amendment to the Nationality Law should apply to the
                                United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Peru, effective
                                Dec. 1, 1924.</note>) and who have thus acquired the nationality of
                            the country of birth, may be regarded as having lost their Japanese
                            nationality from the moment of birth, unless, however, a desire to
                            preserve Japanese nationality has been formally expressed, it affords no
                            relief for Japanese who have acquired foreign nationality by processes
                            of naturalization. Thus, the Japanese Government inferentially
                            reiterates its claim to the continued allegiance of all of its nationals
                            born under the Japanese flag.</p>
                        <p>The attention of American officials in Japan is frequently drawn to
                            Japanese, born in the United States and who have elected to claim
                            American citizenship, who have been conscripted upon their arrival in
                            Japan. In a number of such cases, it was ascertained that these persons
                            were possessed of the belief that the Japanese <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0507"/>authorities could not regard them as
                            Japanese subjects, as the fact of their birth had not been registered in
                            Japan and they were without a Japanese census domicile. The Minister of
                            the Interior pointed out in the Diet that this belief could only be
                            based on ignorance, as the Census Domicile Law, which is also being
                            amended to accord with the Law of Nationality, invests all Japanese with
                            Japanese nationality, whether they have been registered or not. Upon the
                            promulgation of the amendments and of the decree provided for in the
                            amendment to the Law of Nationality, persons of Japanese stock born in
                            certain foreign countries will be presumed to have acquired the
                            nationality of the country in which they were born, and, therefore, to
                            have divested themselves of their Japanese nationality at the time of
                            birth.</p>

                            which the Japanese Government put into effect on December 1, 1924, by
                            which all children born to Japanese parents in the United States and
                            certain other countries after December 1, 1924, shall be regarded as
                            citizens of these countries unless their parents, within fourteen days
                            after their birth, reserve Japanese citizenship for them by registering
                            their names at a Japanese Consulate, I have the honor to report that
                            according to press statements not one of the forty children born to
                            Japanese parents in Hawaii since December first has been registered at
                            the Japanese Consulate-General.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on the new Expatriation Law the Japanese Consul-General at
                            Honolulu, Mr. Keichi Yamazaki, is reported to have said that the new law
                            represents the desire of the Japanese Government to remove all
                            objections which were raised to the former system of dual citizenship
                            and that to this end he is personally urging the parents of those
                            Japanese who are to reside in Hawaii to refrain from registering their
                            children at a Japanese Consulate and thus define their status clearly as
                            American citizens over whom the Japanese Government has relinquished all
                            claim to citizenship.</p>

                            treaty which is being negotiated. The Japanese Government is asking for
                            amendments or interpretations (which would be in the form of an exchange

                            reference to the importation of products especially raw materials such
                            as coal, iron and soya beans into Japan from the railway zone. The
                            assent of the British Government is sought in order that Great Britain
                            may not invoke the most-favored-nation clause of the treaty for British
                            importations into Japan when the duties are lowered between the railway
                            zone and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office asserts that it is entirely in accord with your views
                            and will make no agreement which would impair the territorial and
                            administrative integrity of China, and it is seeking some means which
                            while admitting the right of Japan to lower the duties on products
                            between the zone and Japan will not impinge on that principle.</p>

                            his death and was a Lieutenant (T) with pay at the rate of $324 per
                            month. According to the American actuaries tables he had a normal
                            expectation at the time of his death of 83.21 years of life, during
                            which his pay and allowances, so this Department is informed by the Navy
                            Department, could be expected to increase to approximately $7000 a year
                            up to the probable time of his retirement, after which his retired pay
                            would be $4500 per annum, under existing laws. This expectation of
                            advancement in rank and pay was practically assured by reason of his
                            efficiency, sterling character and exemplary habits. The Navy Department
                            has submitted a statement to this Department in which are set forth the
                            salient facts pertaining to the service record of Lieutenant Langdon,
                            together with information as to the dependency of his surviving
                            relatives and the approximate loss occasioned to them by his untimely
                            death. The Navy Department concluded that in all the circumstances
                            $40,000 would constitute a just and reasonable reparation.</p>
                        <p>Considering the circumstances under which Lieutenant Langdon was killed,
                            his usefulness, expectancy of life, and financial prospects, and the
                            dependent state of his aged parents, the Department feels that
                            indemnification in the amount of $40,000 would be reasonable. Please
                            present the matter to the Japanese Foreign Office and endeavor to obtain
                            settlement on that basis, keeping the Department informed of
                            developments.</p>

                            receipt of your letter of July 27, 1923,<note n="77" xml:id="d322fn77">Not printed.</note> in which you request to be advised of the
                            status of the case of Lieutenant Warren H. Langdon, Chief Engineer
                            Officer of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Albany</hi> who was shot by a
                            Japanese sentry at Vladivostok, Siberia, while returning to his ship on
                            the night of January 8, 1921, the injury resulting in the death of the
                            officer on the following day. You state it to be your understanding that
                            the Navy Board recommended reparation in the sum of $85,000.</p>
                        <p>On March 19, 1923, the American Embassy at Tokyo was instructed to take
                            up with the Japanese Government the matter of securing pecuniary
                            indemnity in the sum of $40,000 for the surviving relatives of
                            Lieutenant Langdon to reimburse them for the loss sustained due to his
                            untimely death. Considering the circumstances under which Lieutenant
                            Langdon was killed, his usefulness, expectancy of life and financial
                            prospects and the dependent state of his aged parents, this Department
                            together with the Navy Department felt that the sum of $40,000 would
                            constitute a just and reasonable reparation. The sum of $85,000, so far
                            as I am aware, was never recommended.</p>
                        <p>The presentation of this claim was deferred, pending the settlement, by
                            this Government, of claims presented by the Japanese Government, for the
                            deaths of two Japanese subjects; one, Uratake by name, was accidentally
                            killed by an American soldier in Honolulu, and the other, Saito by name,
                            was killed during the operations of the Mexican Punitive Expedition.
                            Congress appropriated $5,000 to settle the Uratake case, but did not act
                            upon the Saito claim, as it appeared that Saito had been engaged in
                            selling alcoholic beverages.</p>
                        <p>No report has been received from the Embassy at Tokyo with regard to the
                            developments in this case and the Department has requested the Embassy
                            to submit an immediate report as to its present status. The Department
                            will not fail to communicate with you further when this report is
                            received.</p>

                            Foreign Office the settlement of Langdon case and today have received a
                            lengthy communication on the subject from the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, copies of which will be forwarded in the next pouch. In this
                            note he says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Japanese Government have no objection whatever to giving a
                                    sum of money to the surviving relatives of Lieutenant Langdon as
                                    an expression of their condolence and consolation if so desired
                                    by them. If, however, the payment of a considerable amount is
                                    now to be demanded by way of indemnification, it would compel us
                                    to go back into and discuss the causes and circumstances leading
                                    to this unfortunate affair. In that event a considerable length
                                    of time will further be required in order to achieve its
                                    settlement with the result of this unhappy incident provoking

                                    the surviving relatives of Lieutenant Langdon as an expression
                                    of condolence and consolation with a view to arriving at a
                                    speedy settlement of the present case. I beg to express the hope
                                    that in full appreciation of the foregoing circumstances, your
                                    Government will see their way to accept this proposal.”</p>

                        <p>86. Department’s 49, April 8, 4 p.m., and my despatch no. 403–E, April 1,
                                1924.<note n="79" xml:id="d325fn79">Not printed.</note> My
                            recommendation was based on the assumption, which was clearly indicated
                            in the Department’s instruction no. 170, March 19, 1923, that what the
                            Department primarily desired in making the claim originally was to
                            obtain monetary assistance for Langdon’s family to relieve their need.
                            Knowing the temper of the Japanese War Office in regard to this case,
                            and the difficulty I have experienced in getting them to take any action
                            at all, it seemed to me that a refusal of the present offer would only
                            result in [omission?] delay without any corresponding hope of securing
                            an increase in the amount offered. This is particularly true at this
                            juncture on account of the present feeling here over the immigration
                            situation. If, however, as would now appear to be the case from the
                            Department’s telegram under reference, it was the intention of the
                            Department to demand punitive damages for the purpose of establishing
                            Japanese responsibility for the unfortunate affair, then the reply of
                            the Foreign Office is obviously unsatisfactory. However, I declined [<hi rend="italic">decline to?</hi>] regard the acceptance of the
                            settlement proposed by the Japanese Government as necessarily carrying
                            the implication that our Government would be unwilling to confront a
                            discussion of this case on its merits.</p>

                        <p>This Government is furnishing a limited quantity of war material to the
                            Mexican Government because such action is in the interest of stability
                            and orderly procedure. The attempt that is being made to overthrow the
                            established government in Mexico has resulted from <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0525"/>the animosities and bitterness growing
                            out of the presidential campaign to select a successor to President
                            Obregon. It is highly important that Mexico should break away from a
                            long series of unfortunate precedents and determine the succession to
                            the presidency of that country by peaceful and constitutional methods.
                            It seems that the Mexican Government fully realizes this fact.</p>
                        <p>A Government that has made a zealous effort to meet its obligations at
                            home and abroad has been assailed and an attempt is being made to
                            overthrow it by violence. It has appealed to this Government for aid to
                            the end that order may be restored and preserved and constitutional
                            procedure followed. This Government can not be insensible to such an
                            appeal and it has responded with its support in behalf of stability and
                            orderly constitutional procedure in the best interests of all
                            concerned.</p>

                            whoever may be responsible for the decision to mine the ports of
                            Frontera, Puerto Mexico and Vera Cruz that your Government not only on

                            against this proposed measure as being an unwarranted threat against the
                            commerce of the world involving grave danger to the lives of peaceful
                            citizens of all nationalities and in wanton disregard of any serious

                            been partially or wholly carried out, if the mines and other such
                            obstructions to navigation are not immediately removed from the ports in
                            reference, your Government will be constrained to adopt appropriate

                                    proposed to bombard Salina Cruz this morning. The Consul

                                    morning but he does not state whether the bombardment was

                                    unqualifiedly condemned by your Government as an operation
                                    unwarrantably exposing the lives and interests of American

                        <p>60. Your 46, January 22, noon. The American Consul at Vera Cruz has
                            reported that Mr. de la Huerta has definitely abandoned his effort to
                            blockade the port of Tampico.</p>
                        <p>You will advise the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the foregoing
                            and say that this action terminates the temporary mission of the United
                            States cruiser <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> to Tampico to protect
                            adequately the peaceful and legitimate United States commerce going in
                            and out of that port from interference under any assertions of blockade,
                            and that the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> is being withdrawn from
                            Mexican waters.</p>
                        <p>You will also say in this connection that the reopening of cable
                            communication between Vera Cruz and the United States eliminates the
                            emergency which necessitated the dispatch of the <hi rend="italic">Tacoma</hi> to that port, that consequently the United States
                            cruiser <hi rend="italic">Omaha</hi> and six destroyers ordered to that
                            port because of the disaster to the <hi rend="italic">Tacoma</hi> will
                            be withdrawn from the waters of the Gulf as soon as their services are
                            no longer needed in connection with the rescue of the <hi rend="italic">Tacoma’s</hi> crew which probably will be terminated today and that
                            the <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi> and two tugs, auxiliary vessels of
                            the United States Navy engaged in salvaging the <hi rend="italic">Tacoma</hi>, will also be withdrawn as soon as that task is
                            completed.</p>

                            mined by Federal authorities. He feels that it was not asking too much
                            in view of the removal of this protection he had against an attack by

                            entertain the hope that said gunboat will not be allowed to leave the

                        <p>The city has been entirely evacuated without disturbance although under

                            Mexican ships have left port. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> is in
                            the harbor. The legally elected civil authorities are now functioning
                            effectively due to the suggestions and moral support of the consular
                            corps, the American and Spanish consuls playing the major part. The
                            police force has been adequately organized. This office has furnished 48
                            rifles and ammunition upon the request of the local authorities through
                            the helpful and necessary cooperation of Admiral Magruder. The situation
                            is therefore under control and it is believed that no unpleasant
                            incident will occur. The population has been reassured and is calm. It
                            is expected the Federal troops will assume control tomorrow.</p>

                            Cruz at the earliest possible moment, and the American Consul there has

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of December 31, 1923,<note n="17" xml:id="d353fn17">Not printed.</note> in relation to the closing of the ports of Vera
                            Cruz and Manzanillo, Mexico. You say that those ports were declared
                            closed to foreign commerce by your Government by the method provided for
                            in the law of Mexico, namely, by means of a decree of the Mexican
                            Executive, made known to this Government through your Embassy in
                            compliance with the requirements of international usage.</p>
                        <p>You add that, as a consequence, those responsible for the mooring of
                            vessels and the loading and landing of persons at those ports which have
                            thus been closed by your Government will be subject to trial and
                            punishment in accordance with the law of Mexico as having been done
                            outside of the ports open to foreign trade, and that import, export and
                            other duties paid at those places to private persons no matter what
                            title they carry nor what character they assume shall be held as unpaid
                            for the purposes of the revenue laws. Finally you say that the situation
                            must be temporary and that you will take pleasure in letting the
                            Department of State know when the ports will be reopened.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have the honor to inform you that this Government, with the
                            friendliest disposition toward the Mexican Government, feels obliged,
                            following a long line of precedents, to respect what <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0534"/>are believed to be the requirements of
                            international law, to the effect that a port of a foreign country
                            declared by the government thereof to be outside of its control, cannot
                            be closed by such government save by an effective blockade maintained by
                            it. Therefore, this Government takes the position that it cannot advise
                            American citizens engaged in commerce with Mexico that they cannot have
                            access to ports outside of the control of the Mexican Government and in
                            fact controlled by insurgent forces. Moreover, this Government feels
                            obliged to inform such American citizens that they may, in conformity
                            with international law, deal with persons in authority in such ports
                            with respect to all matters affecting commerce therewith.</p>
                        <p>It is earnestly hoped that the Mexican Government will appreciate the
                            necessity which impels this Government to take this stand, and that it
                            will accordingly consider the wisdom of the withdrawal of the decree of
                            December 10 last and of other like orders, so that no divergence of
                            opinion may be manifested between the two Governments respecting the law
                            applicable to the situation.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I desire to inform you that the position of this Government
                            as above set forth has been communicated to the Foreign Office of your
                            Government by the American Chargé d’Affaires ad interim at Mexico City
                            in pursuance of telegraphic instructions sent to him under date of
                            January 23, 1924.</p>

                            request Foreign Office to take prompt action looking to remission of all
                            further payment of duties by shippers on <hi rend="italic">Esperanza</hi>, pointing out that under applicable rules and
                            principles of international law these American citizens were entitled to
                            pay charges to persons exercising <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            authority in Vera Cruz and having made such payment to be free from
                            further obligations in the matter. You will add that if, as stated by
                            Foreign Office, Mexican law requires exaction of a second payment of
                            duties that law clearly conflicts with principles of international law
                            which Mexican Government will doubtless be desirous of following and

                        <p>In this relation you will recall to attention of Foreign Office that <hi rend="italic">Esperanzaa</hi> entered Vera Cruz and loaded her cargo

                            during revolutionary control, that this action was taken under Article 6

                        <p>113. Discussed matter customs duties with Foreign Minister yesterday. He
                            confirmed position that Mexican Government would not insist upon
                            repayment of customs duties already paid to <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> authorities in control of ports. …</p>
                        <p>I raised the question of duplicate tax payments to state authorities. He
                            replied that it would not be the policy of the Mexican Government to
                            insist upon repayment of state taxes already paid to <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities. He said that the Secretary of the
                            Interior would advise the state authorities to adhere to this rule. I
                            made the suggestion that a general statement be issued by the President
                            to the effect that if such taxes had been paid to the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities they would not have to be repaid. They
                            are reluctant to assume such a bold position in a matter which they
                            believe falls within the rights of the respective states. However, the
                            Government will maintain the general policy set forth above and will
                            request the state authorities not to collect taxes already paid to the
                                <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my telegram No. 198 June 4, 3
                            P.M. regarding the effort of the Mexican Government to expel Mr. H. A.
                            Cunard Cummins, who is in charge of the archives of the British Legation
                            in this capital, I have the honor to inform the Department that at the
                            request of Mr. Cummins, who is remaining for the present within the
                            precincts of the British Legation, I called on him there this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0542"/>
                        <p>Mr. Cummins’ purpose in requesting me to call upon him was not made clear
                            in the course of our conversation unless it was merely for the purpose
                            of informing me of the status of his case.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the notice to leave the country which Mr. Cummins
                            received from the Mexican Government on June 4 contemplated his
                            departure on June 10 and not within ten days as reported in my telegram.
                            The period in question would therefore expire tomorrow. Mr. Cummins
                            informed me that he had telegraphed his Government the substance of the
                            note of June 4 from the Mexican Minister of the Interior and had
                            received from London instructions to reply to the note mentioned and to
                            state that while the British Government was prepared to give Mr. Cummins
                            leave of absence upon the arrival of Mr. Hohler, whose forthcoming
                            journey to Mexico was announced some time ago for the purpose of
                            submitting a report to the British Government on the situation here, any
                            action on the part of the Mexican Government looking to the expulsion of
                            Mr. Cummins would result in the immediate cancellation of Mr. Hohler’s
                            mission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cummins advised me further that about a month ago the Mexican Consul
                            in London had complained to the British Government of the offensive tone
                            of a note delivered by Mr. Cummins to the Mexican authorities in the
                            case of Mrs. Rosalie Evans, a British subject whose property at San
                            Martin de Texmelucan, Puebla, has been expropriated. He said that the
                            British Government had informed the Mexican Consul at London that the
                            statements made by Mr. Cummins in the note were fully justified by the
                            facts. The British Government then obviously assumes responsibility for
                            the note upon which, apparently, the Mexican Government seeks to base
                            its action against Mr. Cummins.</p>
                        <p>This British official is evidently nervous as to the possibility that
                            there may be an attempt on the part of the Mexican authorities actually
                            to invade the British Legation, which is owned by the British
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Cummins seemed desirous of apprising me of the foregoing for my
                            information, on which score I transmit it to the Department.</p>

                        <p>212. Embassy’s 198 dated June 4, 3 p.m. and despatch 8570 dated June 9.
                            Cummins is virtually a prisoner in British Legation which <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0543"/>is now under open surveillance by
                            Mexican authorities. He fears an attempt may be made to enter Legation
                            by force to take him. For that reason he is now in touch with the
                            Chilean Minister, who in the absence of the American Ambassador is dean
                            of the diplomatic corps. His purpose is to enter a vigorous protest
                            before that body in case of a violation of the Legation. Please instruct
                            me for such an eventuality.</p>
                        <p>As set forth in my above-mentioned despatch the British Government’s
                            position is that they will cancel the mission of Sir Thomas Hohler if
                            orders to expel Cummins are carried out. Otherwise Cummins will be given
                            leave when Hohler arrives. Cummins has informed me that Mexican
                            Government is highly indignant because London is supporting him, but I
                            personally doubt if Mexican Government will violate British Legation.
                            Present situation is untenable.</p>

                        <p>219. This afternoon Chilean Minister informed me that he had been
                            unsuccessful in obtaining revocation of expulsion decree against
                            Cummins. Pie read to me a long note which he had received from the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs in answer to his representations on behalf
                            of the diplomatic corps. This note embodies the substance of a statement
                            which Mexican missions abroad will issue tomorrow and sets forth the
                            history of the case, denying the diplomatic character of Cummins and
                            insisting on his expulsion. It is the belief of the Chilean Minister
                            that the Mexican Government has determined to resort to drastic measures
                            which even include entry into British Legation tomorrow. Late this
                            afternoon Chilean Minister <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0544"/>intended to make another attempt to persuade Mexican Government not to
                            resort to extreme measures. …</p>
                        <p>Minister said that this noon he had seen orders from President to take
                            immediate action to expel Cummins.</p>
                        <p>It might be desirable, although it may already be too late, to suggest to
                            British Government the expediency of instructing Cummins to leave Mexico
                            on receipt of passports in due form if Mexican Government can be induced
                            to change its present attitude.</p>
                        <p>Cummins says that if Mexican Government attempts to enter Legation by
                            force tomorrow he intends to remain until locked doors are forced. Then
                            he will surrender quietly. Meanwhile he will continue to fly the British
                            flag over the Legation.</p>

                        <p>224. Department’s 312, June 18, 4 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] p.m. I
                            personally delivered a note to the Under Secretary of Foreign Relations
                            at 6:30 this evening informing the Mexican Government that I was taking
                            over the archives and effects of the British Legation as from this day
                            in pursuance of your instructions and soliciting the cooperation of the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs in facilitating the departure of Cummins. I
                            suggested orally as Chilean Minister had done earlier in the afternoon
                            that the Mexican guard at the British Legation be withdrawn and freedom
                            of communications reestablished. I also addressed a note to Cummins
                            conveying textually his instructions from the British Government and
                            enclosing a copy of my note to the Foreign Office for his
                            information.</p>
                        <p>On my return from Foreign Office I called on Cummins who informed me he
                            was telegraphing his Government requesting detailed instructions as to
                            what should be delivered to me and the procedure that should be followed
                            and that corresponding instructions be sent to me. The Mexican guard had
                            already been withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>I am now in receipt of a note from Cummins suggesting that as “Schoenfeld
                            shall probably require a day or two to receive and act on” my [<hi rend="italic">his</hi>] instructions and as “a packing and
                            disposition of” his (Cummins’) effects “must occupy a day or two” he
                            expects to be able to leave here either on Saturday or Sunday next.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I am in receipt of a note from Minister for Foreign Affairs in
                            acknowledgment of mine taking cognizance of my action and adding that
                            Cummins will be given “usual facilities” to leave here up to 7 o’clock
                            tomorrow evening. I am advising Cummins orally of this at once. I should
                            however welcome earliest possible advices from the Department as to
                            whether I should accept this statement without question, the more so
                            since in my conversation with the Under Secretary of Foreign Relations I
                            intimated that some slight delay might be necessary and he informed me
                            Cummins’ departure might be postponed to Friday 11th hour.</p>

                            departure.</p>

                        <p>226. My telegrams numbers 224, 225 last night. With a view to avoiding
                            embarrassing situation which might arise from noncompliance on the part
                            of Cummins with the demand of the Mexican Government that he depart by 7
                            this evening, and in view of material impossibility of carrying out
                            final arrangements for delivery to me of the British Legation’s archives
                            and effects before that time, I have just called Subsecretary of State
                            for Foreign Affairs and asked whether it would not be possible to grant
                            an extension so that I can carry out my instructions with due
                            completeness as well as obtain supplementary instructions already
                            requested as to details of the transfer.</p>
                        <p>Subsecretary informed me that Chilean Minister as dean of the diplomatic
                            corps had given guarantee yesterday that Cummins had promised to leave
                            tonight though Cummins denies this and Chilean Minister does not admit
                            having given such guarantee.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to Subsecretary that in any case a new [situation?] arose
                            upon arrival of my instructions to take over British Legation and I
                            reiterated material impossibility of closing up affairs in the time
                            given adding that as we were all agreed that Cummins should withdraw it
                            seemed inexpedient to make a special point of the exact moment of his
                            withdrawal. Subsecretary, after consulting Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            who has been unable to receive me, promised to <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0547"/>let me know his decision as soon as
                            President could be consulted in the matter.</p>
                        <p>One p.m. I am just informed by Subsecretary of State for Foreign Affairs
                            that out of consideration for this Embassy time limit for Cummins’
                            departure is extended to 7 o’clock tomorrow, Friday evening. Cummins
                            informed.</p>

                        <p>319. Embassy’s 224, June 18, 9 p.m., and 225, June 18, 10 p.m. Inform
                            Cummins that it is important that he depart from Mexico at the earliest
                            possible time in order to minimize possibility of friction which would
                            be deplored.</p>
                        <p>Inform Minister for Foreign Affairs informally that the Department is
                            gratified to learn that Cummins will be afforded “usual facilities”,
                            which means of course that he will be assured all usual diplomatic
                            immunities in connection with his departure. At the same time you will
                            say that it is the earnest hope and expectation of this Government that
                            Cummins will be given the necessary time to pack his baggage and depart
                            from Mexico. You will say further, if necessary, that this Government
                            would regret to see any steps taken by the Mexican Government which
                            would in any way restrict Mr. Cummins’ personal liberty or comfort in
                            Mexico during the time when he is making all reasonable efforts to
                            depart from Mexico. You are instructed in particular to inform the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs of the unfortunate impression which such
                            restriction would create on the mind of the American people, who are in
                            full sympathy with the general aspirations of the Government of Mexico.
                                <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0548"/>The Government of the
                            United States would consider it indeed unfortunate if any circumstance
                            should arise which would alienate American sympathy from the Government
                            of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that the Government of Mexico will not under any
                            circumstance violate the premises of the British Legation. Should such a
                            violation appear to be imminent you will inform the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs of this Government’s regret were the Government of Mexico to
                            pursue such a course. You will explain that this Government bases its
                            action on the fact that it is now in charge of the archives and effects
                            of the Legation and incidental to that charge must protest. Of course it
                            would be undesirable to intimate that such protest will be made, unless
                            actual danger of violation is imminent.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that your action as stated above must appeal to
                            the good sense of the Government of Mexico and will prevent a situation
                            which would be a cause of regret to all of Mexico’s friends.</p>

                            of any kind nor any show of force. Cummins informed me had received

                                    tried before Belgian consular courts. Belgian Government
                                    suggested that all countries which should adhere to the
                                    convention should be given representation on the Mixed

                        <p>The Belgian Government was then informed by identic notes from the French
                            and British Governments that it was impossible to make any changes in
                            the convention because of the difficulty which had been encountered in
                            reaching an agreement. The Belgian Government is still considering form
                            of reply to be made.</p>
                        <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0552"/>
                        <p>Belgian Government seems to feel that it will eventually be forced to
                            adhere to the present convention. It has reached no decision in regard
                            to the chief of the <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi>. If possible it
                            will make a reservation in regard to the Mixed Tribunals as this is the
                            article to which it chiefly objects. It will also endeavor to make some
                            sort of reservation in regard to its second observation given above.
                            Belgian Government feels that nation is too small to take any effective
                            action against operation of this convention, and an article in the
                            London <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> criticizing Belgium’s attitude
                            toward the new convention has had a certain effect. In regard to the
                            Tangier port concession, the Belgian Government has taken no action and
                            is not yet in a position to comment.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Ambassador’s note of May 29, 1924, informing me of the
                            ratification by the Governments of Great Britain, France and Spain, of
                            the convention signed by those Governments on December 18, 1923,
                            regarding the statute of Tangier, and the deposit of such ratifications
                            on May 14, 1924, at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Paris. The
                            Ambassador states that he has been instructed by his Government to ask,
                            in concert with his French and Spanish colleagues, the accession of the
                            Government of the United States to this convention.</p>
                        <p>I beg to inform you that this Government has given careful consideration
                            to the request and to the convention and related documents with
                            reference to the proposed administration of the Tangier Zone.</p>
                        <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0554"/>
                        <p>It is observed that the representation which the three signatory Powers
                            have assigned to this Government in the conduct of affairs in Tangier is
                            of a far more limited character than that now enjoyed and quite
                            disproportionate to that which the three Powers have allocated to
                            themselves. This Government would not, therefore, care to assume the
                            responsibility which it feels would of necessity devolve upon it from
                            participation in the administration of the Zone, while having no
                            appreciable part in formulating the policies or conducting the affairs
                            of the Zone.</p>
                        <p>This Government has no political interest in Tangier and no desire or
                            purpose to obtain any special rights or privileges which would abridge
                            the rights of nationals of other states. Its interests, as was indicated
                            in the reservation made at the time it signed the Act of Algeciras in
                            1906, and in the Resolution by which the Senate gave its advice and
                            consent to ratification thereof, lie in securing for all peoples the
                            fullest measure of equality of opportunity for commerce and industry in
                            Morocco and in the protection of the life, liberty and property of
                            citizens of the United States going into or having interests in that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Having thus stated the reasons why this Government does not find it
                            practicable to participate in the proposed administrative machinery of
                            the Tangier Zone and the interests which it is this Government’s purpose
                            to protect, I shall indicate with more particularity this Government’s
                            position with respect to the establishment of a regime of the character
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>It is evident from the text of the convention that notwithstanding the
                            proposed participation of other Powers in governmental activities of the
                            Zone, the principal control will be vested in the three signatory
                            Powers, Great Britain, France, and Spain. In many respects the political
                            status of the Zone will be anomalous. It appears, for example, that
                            responsibility for the maintenance of public order and the general
                            administration of the Zone is, under delegation of authority by His
                            Shereefian Majesty, to devolve upon the authority specified in the
                            convention. Sovereignty over the Zone, however, is to remain in His
                            Shereefian Majesty and diplomatic matters are specifically reserved to
                            the Moroccan Government acting through the intermediary of France under
                            Article 5 of the Protectorate Treaty of 1912. The Zone is not,
                            therefore, to be an independent political entity, with an existence
                            separate and apart from the parent State, but will on the contrary be in
                            the nature of a municipality, granted limited legislative, executive and
                            judicial powers, under a charter from the sovereign. So long as the
                            convention shall remain in force (it specifies a period of twelve
                            years), parties thereto apparently can look only to the administration
                            of the Zone for the observance of treaty rights, and the satisfaction
                                <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0555"/>of any claims, grievances,
                            or wrongs of an international character. The administration being
                            international in character would not, therefore, be accountable to any
                            one Power, nor would any one Power be responsible for the acts of the
                            administration. It is therefore conceivable that with no central
                            authority responsible for acts of the Zone administration, difficulty
                            may be experienced by aggrieved parties in obtaining proper recognition
                            of rights, the violation of which, under ordinary conditions, might
                            afford just grounds for international reclamation.</p>
                        <p>This Government being desirous, however, of placing no obstacle in the
                            way of an honest effort to improve conditions in Tangier, would, after
                            having had an opportunity to examine the regulations and codes referred
                            to in Articles 32 and 48 respectively of the convention, consider the
                            possibility of suspending the extraterritorial rights in the Zone to the
                            extent that such rights appear to be safeguarded by the new regime on
                            the following conditions: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the meaning of the provisions concerning the observance
                                    of economic equality shall be explained with greater
                                    particularity, for the purpose of maintaining with no
                                    uncertainty the principle of the open door. This Government
                                    understands that the terms “economic equality among nations” and
                                    “regime of economic equality” used in Articles 7 and 30,
                                    respectively, of the convention, require, among other things,
                                        (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that in all matters pertaining to
                                    customs or tonnage duties, warehousing, port dues, or other

                                    industry, trade or commerce, there shall be no discrimination in

                                    products or ships of one country at any disadvantage as compared
                                    with those of another country; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that
                                    in the right to acquire and hold property, in the pursuit of

                                    to facilities of any kind, there shall be no discrimination;
                                        (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that in the granting of
                                    concessions of all kinds as well as in the granting of contracts
                                    for public works and in the purchase of supplies, there shall be

                        <p>Mr. de Laboulaye said that he had been disturbed by the various and

                            the note and it did not seem quite clear to him what we intended to do.
                            He also thought that some of the phrases in the note were somewhat hard
                            and he implied that he did not find it altogether satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. de Laboulaye that before definitely approaching the question
                            of our adhesion to the Convention, we had first wished to consult the
                            three governments with regard to the question of guarantees and
                            safeguards as raised in our note. We believed that further
                            correspondence would reveal the method by which those governments would
                            assure us of the guarantees and safeguards which we desired and that the
                            question of acceding to the Convention could then be approached. If
                            these guarantees and safeguards were given us in a satisfactory manner,
                            it was our intention to consider recommending to the Senate the
                            suspension of our extraterritorial rights and our adhesion to the
                            Convention with the reservation that we should not participate in the
                            administration of the Zone. This of course implied that we should not
                            wish to avail <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0557"/>ourselves of
                            appointing a representative to the Legislative Assembly as provided for
                            in the Convention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. de Laboulaye said that this explanation was fully satisfactory. He
                            thought the desired guarantees could be given by an exchange of notes (I
                            suggested also the possibility of a protocol) so that the text of the
                            Convention itself need not be altered. It would remain with us to decide
                            whether we wished to avail ourselves of filling the position accorded us
                            on the Legislative Assembly. I repeated that we did not wish to assume
                            any obligations in connection with the administration of the Zone, but
                            added, as I had told him before, that our spirit in the matter was one
                            of cooperation and that we desired to place no obstacles in the way of
                            the proposed regime so long as our interests were properly
                            safeguarded.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to inform you that His
                            Majesty’s Government have not failed to accord the most careful
                            consideration to the note which you were so good as to address to Mr.
                            Brooks on July 11th last containing the reply of the United States
                            Government to the invitation extended to them by the Governments of
                            Great Britain, France and Spain to accede to the Tangier Convention and
                            to renounce their extra-territorial rights in the Tangier Zone.</p>
                        <p>I am now instructed by Mr. Secretary MacDonald to communicate to you the
                            following expression of the views of His Majesty’s Government upon the
                            matters discussed therein.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government wish at the outset to express their
                            gratification at the friendly terms of your note above-mentioned and
                            their appreciation of the desire avowed by the Government of the United
                            States to place no obstacle in the way of an honest effort to improve
                            existing conditions at Tangier.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of your note it is intimated that the United States
                            Government will consider the possibility of returning a favourable
                            response to the three Powers subject to the receipt of satisfactory
                            assurances on five specific points. His Majesty’s Government desire to
                            offer the following observations on each of the points in question.</p>
                        <p>1. Definitions of the terms “economic equality among nations” and “regime
                            of economic equality” were intentionally omitted from articles 7 and 30
                            of the Tangier Convention. It was thought that definitions might obscure
                            rather than clarify the meaning of the terms. In deference to the wish
                            of the Government of the United <pb n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0558"/>States, His Majesty’s Government are ready to declare that they
                            interpret articles 7 and 30 of the Convention as requiring <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) in all matters relating to customs or tonnage
                            duties, warehousing, port dues or other charges or taxes of whatever
                            character pertaining to industry, trade or commerce there shall be no
                            discrimination in law or in fact placing or tending to place the
                            nationals, products or ships of one country at any disadvantage as
                            compared with those of another country; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) as
                            regards the right to acquire and hold property, the pursuit of
                            occupations, industry or professions, and all that pertains to
                            facilities of any kind there shall be no discrimination; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) in the granting of concessions of all kinds,
                            as well as in the granting of contracts for public works and in the
                            purchase of supplies there shall be suitable opportunity for competition
                            and open bidding free from any condition or provision calculated to give
                            competitors of one nationality any advantage over those of another; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) no monopoly or exclusive privilege shall be
                            created or granted which would result in monopolisation of the markets,
                            resources or facilities of the Tangier zone for the benefit of any
                            special interests, directly or indirectly or in any exclusion or
                            preferential advantage inconsistent with the principle of complete
                            equality of opportunity. In order to avoid any misunderstanding it
                            should be added that under articles 8 and 9 of the Tangier Convention
                            nationals of Germany, Austria and Hungary are excluded from the
                            enjoyment of economic equality as defined above.</p>
                        <p>2. There seems to be some misapprehension on this point in the mind of
                            the United States Government. Under the terms of the Convention neither
                            the internal nor external affairs of the zone are in the hands of the
                            signatories, whose powers of intervention are limited to the functions
                            assigned by articles 30 and 31 to the Committee of Control in which all
                            the signatories of the Act of Algeciras are equally represented, and to
                            which is entrusted the task of ensuring the observance of the regime of
                            economic equality and the provisions of the Tangier Convention. The
                            internal administration of the zone is in the hands of the Assembly
                            which is composed of representatives of the various countries in
                            proportion to their number, wealth and commerce and of administrative
                            officials responsible only to the Assembly. The external affairs of the
                            zone are dealt with in article 5 of the Convention, which provides that
                            in diplomatic matters there shall be no derogation from the provisions
                            of article 5 of the Protectorate Treaty of March 30th, 1912. Article 5
                            of the Protectorate Treaty lays down that the “Resident General is the
                            only intermediary of the Sultan with foreign representatives and in the
                            relations which these representatives have with the Shereefian
                            Government. He is entrusted with the negotiation of all questions
                            affecting foreigners in Morocco”. The signatories of the Tangier
                            Convention have thus recognised the special rights and with them the
                            special responsibility of France in the Tangier zone in so far as
                            diplomatic questions are concerned. It is the special duty of the
                            Committee of Control, on which His Majesty’s Government earnestly hope
                            that the United States will be represented, to ensure that the Tangier
                            administration is not guilty of acts or omissions which would ordinarily
                            give rise to international representations. Should such a situation
                            arise, however, the French Government are obliged <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0559"/>under the terms of the Convention to
                            accept, and are understood in fact to be prepared to acknowledge, full
                            responsibility towards the United States or any other government.</p>
                        <p>3. In framing the Dahir establishing the Mixed Tribunal the
                            representatives of the signatory states were actuated by the almost
                            universally accepted principle of the divorcement of the judicial from
                            the executive authority. For that reason it was provided in the Statute
                            that the magistrates should be appointed by the Sultan on the
                            recommendation of the government concerned without reference to the
                            Tangier Assembly, and that no person holding an official position should
                            sit on the tribunal as an associate judge. His Majesty’s Government feel
                            that a rigid adherence to the above provisions Is in the best interests
                            of Tangier. Nevertheless, in order to meet the wishes of the United
                            States Government, they are willing to interpret the Convention as
                            permitting the designation of an associate judge or judges from amongst
                            the personnel of the United States Consulate at Tangier, excluding only
                            consular officers <hi rend="italic">de carrière</hi> and provided that
                            the nominee be an American citizen. They trust that this solution will
                            be satisfactory to the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>4. His Majesty’s Government confirm that the provisions of article 13 of
                            the convention with respect to semsars are intended in no way, and do
                            not in fact, affect the existing rights of the powers in regard to
                            semsars in other parts of Morocco.</p>
                        <p>5. His Majesty’s Government agree that the extension to the Tangier Zone
                            of any future international agreement concluded by His Shereefian
                            Majesty shall not in any way prejudice or abridge the rights of American
                            citizens in Tangier without the consent of the United States
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government note with regret that the United States
                            Government do not propose to participate in the administration of the
                            Tangier zone. They trust, however, that that decision does not mean that
                            the United States Government will not be represented on the Committee of
                            Control. His Majesty’s Government do not aspire to a predominant
                            position at Tangier. They sincerely desire the co-operation of all the
                            powers to secure the principle of economic equality, the maintenance of
                            which is the primary function of the Committee of Control and they
                            believe that the representation of the United States on that body will
                            be no less in the interests of the United States than in those of the
                            inhabitants of the zone.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful if you would give these observations of His
                            Majesty’s Government your careful consideration, and inform me at your
                            early convenience of the decision of the United States Government in
                            this matter. I need hardly say that if there is any question in
                            connection with the Treaty requiring further elucidation, I am entirely
                            at your disposal to give such explanation as I can or to make enquiries
                            of the Foreign Office on such points.</p>

                            considered very carefully and with the most sincere wish of arriving at

                            submit to Your Excellency the following remarks and explanations:</p>

                            special interests, directly or indirectly, or that would lead either to
                            any exclusion or preferential treatment inconsistent with the principle
                            of full equality of opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing, of course, cannot affect the provisions of Articles 8 and
                            9 of the Convention of Paris of December 18, last, relative to the
                            Statute of Tangier. These Articles specify that in accordance with No.
                            141 and the following Articles of the Treaty of Versailles, the
                            provisions of the said Statute cannot be claimed by the German, Austrian
                            and Hungarian nationals.</p>
                        <p>2nd. The American Government asked that the signatories of the convention
                            should undertake to assume full responsibility for all acts or omissions
                            of the executive authorities of the zone which would usually give birth
                            to an international claim.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States will kindly remember in this
                            connection that under Article 5 of the said Convention the Delegation
                            given by the Sultan on the Tangier zone is permanent and general “except
                            in diplomatic matters for which the provisions of Article 5 of the
                            Protectorate Treaty of March 30, 1912, stand”.</p>
                        <pb n="467" xml:id="pg_467" facs="0561"/>
                        <p>Now this Article 5 of the Protectorate Treaty provides “that the Resident
                            Commissioner General is the only intermediary of the Sultan with the
                            foreign representatives and in the relations maintained by said
                            representatives with the Shereefian Government. He has in particular
                            charge of all questions concerning aliens in Morocco.”</p>
                        <p>The signatories to the Tangier Convention have thus confirmed in
                            diplomatic matters and for that zone the formal rights of France, the
                            power which protects Morocco, and as a consequence the responsibility of
                            France in such matters.</p>
                        <p>The above mentioned reservation in Article 5 of the Convention relative
                            to the Statute is, furthermore reproduced in Article I, Second
                            subsection of the draft of Dahir organizing the administration of the
                            zone which confirms the general and permanent delegation given by the
                            Sultan of the zone “does not apply to diplomatic matters in regard to
                            which the provisions of Article 5 of the Treaty of March 30, 1912 are
                            fully observed;”</p>
                        <p>(3) With regard to the administration of justice, the American Government
                            would like to be at liberty to select from the staff of the American
                            Consulate at Tangier the associate judge or judges who are to sit in all
                            cases in which an American citizen is concerned.</p>
                        <p>By reason of the widely accepted principle of the separation of the
                            Powers it does not seem possible to gratify that wish in the manner in
                            which it is expressed. Acting upon the said principle, Article I of the
                            Dahir concerning the organization of international justice at Tangier
                            provides that unsalaried associate members of the court are free to
                            engage in an occupation or profession “but not in public office”. It is
                            not easily seen how this provision could reasonably be contravened.</p>
                        <p>If, however, the United States Government understood the phrase “staff of
                            the Consulate” to mean the auxiliary members, exclusive of the career
                            officials, the text might be interpreted so as to satisfy your
                            Excellency, with the understanding that the associate judges so selected
                            should be American citizens. This last reservation may be deemed
                            unnecessary since Article I of the above mentioned Dahir provides that
                            the associate members are “subjects or citizens of every one of the
                            Powers signatory to the Act of Algeciras” and it so happens that the
                            staff of the diplomatic agency of the United States now includes
                            employes who are not Americans but belong to the Syrian or Moorish
                            nationality.</p>
                        <p>4th. My Government is in position to give Your Excellency the assurance
                            that there was no question of making any change whatsoever in the
                            existing rights with regard to the protégés in other parts of Morocco
                            through the provisions in Article 13 of the Convention.</p>
                        <p>5th. It is expressly understood with regard to the extension to the zone
                            of Tangier of the international agreements that may hereafter be made by
                            his Shereefian Majesty with other powers that no agreement of that
                            character shall be considered as restricting the rights of American
                            citizens without the consent of their Government.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed to express in submitting the foregoing to Your Excellency
                            for your benevolent consideration the wish that you would find
                            sufficient grounds therein to agree to give your adhesion <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0562"/>to the Statute of Tangier which, as you
                            know, we all earnestly desire and which would powerfully contribute to
                            developing the region in the interest of all.</p>
                        <p>Be pleased [etc.]</p>

                            advising Your Excellency of the ratification by the Governments of
                            Spain, Great Britain and France of the Convention signed by said
                            Governments on December 18, 1923, concerning the Statute of Tangier and
                            asking, jointly with my colleagues of France and England, the Government
                            of the United States to adhere to that Convention.</p>
                        <p>The said note of July 11, 1924 from Your Excellency has been carefully
                            examined by the Government of His Majesty and I am in receipt of
                            instructions from the President of the Military Directorate to present
                            to Your Excellency the viewpoint of the said Directorate about the
                            contents of Your Excellency’s note, which viewpoint can be summed up in
                            the following remarks:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Regime of Free Economic Competition:</hi> Although the
                            stipulations contained in the Spanish-Franco-English Convention relative
                            to the Statute of Tangier on this point constitute a sufficiently full
                            and clear guarantee of the regime of free economic competition, His
                            Majesty’s Government would have no objection whatsoever to giving the
                            Washington Cabinet such concrete details and explanations as it might be
                            pleased to ask on the subject.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government is aware of the wording of the declarations and
                            explanations furnished on the subject to the Government of the United
                            States by that of the French Republic and fully agrees with its
                            terms.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Personality and responsibility of the Tangier
                                Administration:</hi> The American Government desires that the
                            signatories to the Convention of Paris will assume full responsibility
                            for any acts or omission on the part of the administrative authorities
                            of the zone of the kind which under ordinary circumstances give right to
                            international claims. The concern which seems to have prompted this
                            demand <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0563"/>may easily be dispelled
                            in the opinion of the Military Directorate by the statement that the
                            part taken by the American Consul in the labors of the Control Committee
                            and the special powers of that assembly constitute a sufficient
                            guarantee for the Government of the United States in this respect.</p>
                        <p>There should also be taken into account with respect to the point here
                            referred to, Article 6 of the Convention of Paris, to which His
                            Majesty’s Government is a signatory.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Administration of Justice:</hi> His Majesty’s
                            Government is of opinion that the power implied in the provision in
                            Article 6, Paragraph 4 of the judicial Dahir constitutes a judicial
                            guarantee as effective for North American citizens as the right to elect
                            their assistants from among the officials assigned to the Consulate of
                            their country in Tangier could be.</p>
                        <p>In any event the Military Directorate, moved by a spirit of friendly
                            conciliation, is ready to accept, and even now does accept, the phrase
                            “public function” contained in paragraph 4 of article 1 of the judicial
                            Dahir be interpreted to mean that it does not include the subordinate
                            bureaucratic functions discharged by European officials assigned to the
                            foreign Consulates in Tangier.</p>
                        <p>By virtue of this opinion His Majesty’s Government has no objection to
                            admitting that in cases where there may be occasion to appoint an
                            American assistant the choice may fall upon any of the subordinate
                            officials assigned to the Consulate of the United States at Tangier
                            provided he is an American citizen. This interpretation of the
                            Convention shall not, however, apply to the Consular officers of career
                            who may and do have in the Control Committee different powers and duties
                            which are perfectly well defined in the Statute and which should not be
                            confounded with or exercised at the same time as the administration of
                            justice.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Régime of protection:</hi> The American Government
                            desires that it be well understood that the provisions contained in
                            article 13 relative to the suppression of the regime of protection
                            exclusively referred to the city of Tangier and its Zone and that the
                            international stipulations which govern the said regime of protection
                            must be considered as subsisting in other parts of Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Government, of course, would like the Government of the
                            United States to waive, as a consequence of the United States giving up
                            the regime of capitulations in the Tangier Zone, at the same time and
                            voluntarily in the zone of the Spanish Protectorate, the benefits
                            derived from the said régime which in the opinion of the Military
                            Directorate surely does not constitute a supreme guarantee for a defense
                            in the interests of any foreign subject residing in said zone since
                            there are in that zone perfectly organized courts of justice
                            officiating.</p>
                        <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0564"/>
                        <p>There is no objection, however, to declaring expressly that the
                            stipulations of article 13 of the Spanish-Franco-English Convention of
                            December, 1923, refer exclusively to the city of Tangier and its
                            district, the consequence being that all that has to do with United
                            States waiving the regime of capitulations and protection in any other
                            zone of Morocco must be made the subject of separate negotiations.</p>
                        <p>It being the purpose and desire of His Majesty’s Government to place upon
                            the future administration of the Tangier Zone the stamp of an

                            upon the American cooperation as strong and as effective as the
                            interests of its citizens in that port may suggest and even now with the
                            honoring and efficient cooperation of the Consular officer of the United
                            States on the Control Committee, the working of which justifies such
                            great hopes with regard to the maintenance of the essential principles

                        <p>Excellency: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your courteous
                            note of October 10, 1924, regarding the proposal of your Government and
                            the Governments of France and Spain that the United States shall adhere
                            to the Convention signed December 18, 1923, with reference to the
                            Statute of Tangier.</p>
                        <p>I stated in my note of July 11, 1924, that this Government would, after
                            having had an opportunity to examine the regulations and codes referred
                            to in Articles 32 and 48, respectively, of the Convention, consider the
                            possibility of suspending its extraterritorial rights in the Zone of
                            Tangier, to the extent that such rights might appear to be safeguarded
                            by the new régime on certain conditions specified in the note.</p>
                        <p>You have been good enough to favor me with the views of your Government
                            on each of the points raised in my note. Those views, as well as the
                            views expressed by the Governments of France and Spain on the same
                            subject, have been given most careful consideration <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0565"/>by this Government, and I beg now to
                            submit the following comments thereon in the order in which the
                            different subjects are discussed in your note.</p>
                        <p>1. I am pleased to note that your Government accepts this Government’s
                            understanding, as expressed in paragraph numbered 1 of my note of July
                            11, 1924, of the meaning of the terms “economic equality among nations”
                            and “regime of economic equality” employed in Articles 7 and 30,
                            respectively, of the Convention. The replies of the French and Spanish
                            Governments on this point are likewise acceptable to this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to the condition indicated in paragraph numbered 2 of my
                            note of July 11, 1924, that the signatories to the Convention shall
                            assume responsibility for any acts or omissions of the administrative
                            authorities of the Zone which would ordinarily give rise to a right of
                            international reclamation, you state the French Government, as the only
                            intermediary of the Sultan with foreign representatives and in the
                            relations which those representatives have with the Shereefian
                            Government, will assume full responsibility in the Tangier Zone toward
                            the United States or any other government, in so far as diplomatic
                            questions are concerned. A similar statement is contained in the notes
                            which I have received from the French Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>It is not, however, entirely clear to this Government whether it is
                            intended that the French Government should assume this responsibility or
                            whether that Government is merely to act as the intermediary of the
                            Moroccan Government in such matters. In view of this uncertainty I
                            should be pleased to receive a further expression of your Government’s
                            understanding of the situation.</p>
                        <p>3. With respect to the third point mentioned in my note of July 11
                            regarding the designation of associate judges from among the personnel
                            of the American Consulate General at Tangier, to sit on the Mixed Courts
                            in cases to which American citizens are parties, you state that in
                            framing the dahir establishing the Mixed Tribunal the representatives of
                            the signatory states were actuated by the principle of the divorcement
                            of the judicial from the executive authority, and that it was,
                            therefore, provided in the statute that no person holding an official
                            position should sit on the Tribunals as an associate judge. You express
                            willingness to interpret the Convention as permitting the designation of
                            an associate judge or judges from among the personnel of the American
                            Consulate General exclusive of officers <hi rend="italic">de
                                carrière.</hi></p>
                        <p>This Government’s only purpose in desiring the privilege of selecting
                            judges from among its consular personnel in Tangier is to insure proper
                            representation on the Mixed Courts. There are, as your Government is
                            aware, but few American citizens in Tangier and it is probable that at
                            times it might be difficult to find outside of official, circles a
                            person suitable for the important duty of acting as associate judge. It
                            is, therefore, considered that, with a view to assisting, in so far as
                            may be practicable, in maintaining the courts on such a plane as will
                            inspire confidence and promote a proper administration of justice, this
                            Government should be free to designate for this duty any qualified
                            citizen of the United States regardless of the fact that he may hold a
                            position as consular officer <hi rend="italic">de carrière.</hi></p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0566"/>
                        <p>I fully share the view of your Government, and this appears also to be
                            the view of the French and Spanish Governments, concerning the
                            desirability of separating the judicial from the executive authority,
                            but I would respectfully suggest that since this Government does not
                            contemplate taking any part in the administration of the Zone of Tangier
                            and since its consular officers will not, therefore, occupy any
                            executive position in connection therewith, not even on the Committee of
                            Control to which you refer, the designation of such consular officers as
                            associate judges would not seem to run counter to the purposes of the
                            Convention in this respect.</p>
                        <p>I assume, therefore, that in the light of this explanation the objections
                            voiced by the signatories to the Convention with respect to the
                            designation of consular officers <hi rend="italic">de carrière</hi> as
                            associate judges will no longer obtain. I should be pleased if I might
                            have the assurance of your Government on this point.</p>
                        <p>4. I observe with satisfaction your Government’s confirmation of this
                            Government’s understanding, stated in paragraph 4 of my note of July 11,
                            that the provisions of Article 13 of the Convention with respect to
                            semsars are intended in no way, and do not in fact affect the existing
                            rights of the powers in regard to semsars in other parts of Morocco.
                            Similar assurances have also been received from the Governments of
                            France and Spain.</p>
                        <p>5. I also note with satisfaction that your Government agrees that the
                            extension to the Tangier Zone of any future agreement concluded by His
                            Shereefian Majesty with any other Power shall not in any way prejudice
                            or abridge the rights of American citizens in Tangier without the
                            consent of this Government.</p>
                        <p>In addition to receiving further assurances on the points discussed in
                            paragraphs numbered 2 and 3 above I should be pleased to be informed (1)
                            whether the regulations and codes referred to above have been compiled
                            and whether it is intended that this Government shall be given an
                            opportunity to examine them before steps are taken to put them into
                            operation, and (2) whether it is intended that the diplomatic agencies
                            in Tangier, which it is provided in Article 49 of the Convention shall
                            be replaced by consulates, shall be established elsewhere in Morocco and
                            if not, by what method it is contemplated that diplomatic relations with
                            the Shereefian Empire shall be maintained.</p>
                        <p>Upon receipt of satisfactory assurances on these remaining points, this
                            Government will, as stated in my note of July 11, 1924, consider the
                            possibility of suspending its extraterritorial rights in Tangier to the
                            extent that they may appear to be adequately safeguarded by the proposed
                            new regime. Your Government will, of course, understand that the
                            Executive Branch of this Government cannot undertake to make the
                            provisions of the Convention applicable to American citizens in Tangier
                            without an appropriate Convention to that end with the approval of the
                            Senate of the United States or appropriate legislative sanction of the
                            suspension of extraterritorial rights.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to your recent
                            call at the Department, at which time you inquired whether the United
                            States would be disposed to extend for the further period of five years
                            the Convention of Arbitration concluded between the United States and
                            the Netherlands, May 2, 1908, and extended by the operation of renewal
                            agreements until March 25 next.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to assure you that the United States is ready to enter into a
                            renewal agreement with the following understanding. On February 24 last
                            the President proposed to the Senate<note n="2" xml:id="d396fn2"><ref target="frus1923v01#pg_17"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, 1923,
                                    vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 17</ref>.</note> that it
                            consent under certain stated conditions to the adhesion by the United
                            States to the Protocol of December 16, 1920, under which the Permanent
                            Court of International Justice has been created at The Hague. In the
                            event that the Senate gives its assent to the proposal, this Government
                            would wish to be able to rely upon a previous assurance that the
                            Government of the Netherlands would not be averse to considering a
                            modification of the convention of arbitration to be renewed, or the
                            making of a separate agreement, providing for the reference of disputes
                            mentioned in the Convention to the Permanent Court of International
                            Justice.</p>
                        <p>Upon the assurance from yourself that your Government is disposed to
                            renew the arbitration convention now existing between the two countries
                            with such an understanding, I shall at once arrange to have the draft of
                            a convention prepared for your consideration and send you in advance a
                            copy of my proposed note; and I should be glad in that event to receive
                            a copy of your Government’s proposed reply with respect to the

                            Cross, Commercial Attaché of the Legation, had an occasion to bring this
                            matter up discreetly in a private conversation to-day with Dr. J. A.
                            Nederbragt, Chief of the Economic Section of the Netherlands Foreign
                            Office.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Nederbragt stated that the question of some new arrangement with the
                            United States had already come up in the Foreign Office committee
                            dealing with tariff questions and that the Foreign Office would be
                            extremely glad to negotiate an unconditional most-favored-nation clause
                            with the United States, as all the Netherlands asks is competitive
                            equality.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that Dr. Nederbragt has been charged with the work of
                            preparing new commercial agreements with foreign countries, it seems
                            fairly safe to assume that the Netherlands Government <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0571"/>would not be at all opposed to the

                        <p>65. Department’s telegram 56, November 21, 1923, 3 p.m. Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs has sent me a note stating that Netherland Government is
                            disposed in principle to conclude a new general treaty of amity,
                            commerce, and consular rights with the United States on basis of
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. He adds that he wishes at
                            the proper time to be informed as to the views of the American
                            Government with respect to the time for the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Minister wishes as soon as possible to announce the proposed
                            negotiation of the treaty. In order to anticipate unauthorized
                            announcement he thinks it wise to give the press an inspired
                            announcement and suggests that the statement be issued for coincident
                            publication in the United States and the Netherlands on Saturday,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Following conversations which you recently
                            had with officers of the Department and conversations which the American
                            Minister at The Hague has had with officials of the Netherlands
                            Government, I have the honor to inform you that this Government is
                            cordially disposed to enter into negotiations with the Netherlands
                            Government for the conclusion of a treaty of friendship, commerce and
                            consular rights. As appropriate to that end there is submitted to you
                            here with <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0573"/>the draft of a
                            proposed treaty<note n="8" xml:id="d406fn8"><p>Not printed; the draft
                                    treaty submitted to the Netherland Minister was the same, with a
                                    few modifications, as the draft treaty transmitted to the
                                    Ambassador in Spain in instruction no. 162, May 18, 1923,
                                    printed in <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_831"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 831</ref>. The one important difference was
                                    the insertion in the draft treaty for the Netherlands of a
                                    paragraph in article VII reading as follows:</p>
                                <p>“All articles which are or may be legally imported from foreign
                                    countries into ports of the United States in vessels of the
                                    United States may likewise be imported into those ports in
                                    vessels of the Netherlands, without being liable to any other or
                                    higher duties or charges whatsoever than if such articles were
                                    imported in vessels of the United States; and, reciprocally, all
                                    articles which are or may be legally imported from foreign
                                    countries into the ports of the Netherlands in vessels of the
                                    Netherlands, may likewise be imported into these ports in
                                    vessels of the United States without being liable to any other
                                    or higher duties or charges whatsoever than if such articles
                                    were imported from foreign countries in vessels of the
                                    Netherlands.”</p></note> of which the text is
                            self-explanatory.</p>
                        <p>You will observe from the preamble that the document embodies a treaty of
                            friendship as well as of commerce and of consular rights. It is designed
                            to promote the friendly intercourse between the peoples of the United
                            States and the Netherlands. Through the text submitted it is sought to
                            lay the foundation for a comprehensive arrangement responsive to the
                            modern and exacting requirements of important maritime states. To that
                            end the several Articles are expressed in terms which definitely and
                            clearly set forth the principles involved. It is sought by this means to
                            avoid as far as possible danger of conflicting interpretations.</p>
                        <p>You will be interested in noting that Article VII makes full provision
                            for the enjoyment of the most favored nation clause in its unconditional
                            form, as applied to persons, vessels and cargoes, and to articles the
                            growth, produce or manufacture of the Contracting Parties. It will be
                            seen, moreover, that the most favored nation clause is applied to duties
                            on imports and exports and to other charges, restrictions and
                            prohibitions on goods imported and exported.</p>
                        <p>It is provided by Article XXX of the draft that the Convention of
                            Commerce and Navigation, concluded by the United States and the
                            Netherlands on August 26, 1852<note n="9" xml:id="d406fn9">Malloy, <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>, 1776–1909, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 1248.</note> and the Consular

                            from the date of the exchange of ratifications of the proposed treaty.
                            This Government is hopeful that this proposal will meet with the
                            approval of your Government.</p>
                        <p>The document in its present form may, of course, be subject to minor
                            changes by the United States in the course of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>This Government is gratified to learn that it is agreeable to your
                            Government that the negotiations shall be carried on at this

                        <p>The Minister of the Netherlands presents his compliments to the Honorable
                            the Secretary of State and, acting upon instructions received from his
                            Government, has the honor to inform him that the Royal Government,
                            having taken cognizance of the draft of a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and
                            Consular Eights proposed by the United States Government and submitted
                            to the Royal Government by the note of the Secretary of State of January
                            9, 1924, wishes to give expression to her satisfaction and appreciation
                            of the efforts of the United States Government to arrive at constructive
                            work in the field of commercial treaties and of the liberal principles
                            that guide her hereby.</p>
                        <p>This appreciation, however, does not prevent the Royal Netherland
                            Government’s having several objections against the proposed treaty,
                            objections which are raised in a spirit of willingness to cooperate with
                            the United States Government in the direction indicated by her.</p>
                        <p>In the first place the Royal Netherland Government in principle is not in
                            favor of highly detailed treaties if not strictly necessary. If treaties
                            intended to remain in force for a length of time enter into various
                            details instead of limiting themselves to the basic principles of the
                            understanding, there is in the opinion of the Royal Government, always a
                            danger that their effect be contrary to that which they have in view,
                            that in concrete questions which may arise they might easily cause
                            controversies instead of avoiding them. Furthermore, detailed clauses
                            sometimes go farther than conditions in the two countries demand. Even
                            if such clauses could be accepted with regard to one certain country it
                            would be inadvisable to have such stipulations inserted in a Treaty as
                            the most-favored-nation-clause perhaps might render such stipulations
                            applicable also with regard to other countries with respect to which
                            they could not be acceptable. For Colonial Powers as the Netherlands a
                            detailed treaty, moreover, always offers the difficulty that some
                            clauses are undesirable for the Mother Country as they would stamp her
                            more or less with backwardness, and other clauses could go too far where
                            the Colonies are concerned, where the conditions are not yet developed
                            in the same degree as in the Mother Country.</p>
                        <p>Besides objections of this more general character against the system
                            which has been followed by the drafting of the treaty in question, the
                            Royal Government has objections against several special clauses of the
                            draft which in the course of further negotiations may be brought
                            forward. For the present it seems sufficient to point out that for
                            instance Article VII would put the Netherlands in a considerably <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0575"/>less favorable position than
                            has been acquired by the treaty of August 26, 1852.</p>
                        <p>In connection with her objections against the system of the drafted
                            treaty as well as against several special clauses thereof, the Royal
                            Netherland Government foresees that negotiations about a more or less
                            explicit commercial and consular treaty between the United States
                            Government and the Royal Netherland Government will take a considerable
                            length of time. Therefore the Royal Government being in full accordance
                            with the desire of the United States Government to lay a foundation for
                            the relations between both Governments as far as Commerce and Consular
                            Rights are concerned, suggests that for the present time both parties
                            satisfy themselves with entering into a simple agreement—either in the
                            shape of an <hi rend="italic">optima forma</hi> treaty or in the form of
                            an exchange of notes—substantially limited to a reciprocal warrant of
                            unconditional-most-favored-nation-treatment and safeguarding the mutual
                            rights of both countries as agreed upon by the above mentioned Treaty of
                            1852.</p>
                        <p>Jonkheer de Graeff would be glad to learn from the Secretary of State
                            whether this suggestion of the Royal Government meets with the approval
                            of the United States Government.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the Minister of the
                            Netherlands, and has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the
                            Minister’s note of May 8, 1924, relating to the proposal made by the
                            United States for the negotiation of a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and
                            Consular rights between the United States and the Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>Careful consideration has been given to the counter-proposal made by the
                            Government of the Netherlands that for the time being the United States
                            and the Netherlands enter into an agreement substantially limited to a
                            reciprocal warrant of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment and
                            safeguarding the mutual rights agreed upon by the United States and the
                            Netherlands in the Convention of Commerce and Navigation concluded on
                            August 26, 1852.</p>
                        <p>Stipulations concerning many of the subjects included in the draft for a
                            treaty which was transmitted to the Minister of the Netherlands on
                            January 9, 1924, are in force on a reciprocal basis under treaties to
                            which the United States is a party. The United States is not inclined to
                            extend the benefits of certain of such provisions or of <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0576"/>proposals which it made in the draft
                            submitted to the Minister of the Netherlands to countries which do not
                            accord to the United States treatment completely reciprocal, as might be
                            the consequence if the United States should become a party to treaties
                            containing a most-favored-nation clause applicable to those subjects
                            instead of specific reciprocal stipulations concerning them.</p>
                        <p>It may be, however, that it is the intention of the Government of the
                            Netherlands that the agreement for unconditional most-favored-nation
                            treatment, which it suggested, shall relate only to commercial
                            privileges. With respect to commercial privileges which are not covered
                            by the Convention of 1852, the Secretary of State understands that the
                            United States and the Netherlands now apply most-favored-nation
                            treatment to the commerce between the two countries. The United States,
                            for its part, does not contemplate making any departure from that
                            principle.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the Convention of 1852 is in full force the Secretary of
                            State does not perceive the object that would be attained by including
                            in a new instrument a provision purporting to safeguard the rights
                            stipulated in that Convention as was suggested by the Government of the
                            Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>It is not apparent to the Secretary of State in what particulars the
                            Netherlands would be placed in a less favorable position under Article
                            VII of the draft for a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular
                            Eights submitted to the Minister of the Netherlands on January 9, 1924,
                            than has been acquired under the Convention of Commerce and Navigation
                            concluded on August 26, 1852. The Secretary of State would be glad to
                            receive information on this point, as well as information in regard to
                            modifications of other clauses of the draft which it appears from the
                            Minister’s note the Government of the Netherlands may desire to
                            suggest.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your note of July 11, 1924 I
                            have the honor to inform you that the Royal Government although
                            disappointed that the American Government cannot agree with the proposal
                            made in my note of May 8, 1924 to enter for the time being in an
                            agreement substantially limited to a reciprocal warrant of unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment has instructed me to proceed with
                            negotiations on the basis of the draft for a Treaty of Amity, Commerce
                                <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0577"/>and Consular Eights as
                            submitted to my Government on January 9, 1924</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to these instructions I allow myself to broach in the first
                            place two questions that in the opinion of my Government are of primary
                            importance as the solution thereof may greatly influence her attitude
                            toward the drafted treaty in general.</p>
                        <p>With a few words I mentioned already the first of these questions in fine
                            of paragraph 4 of my aforesaid note of May 8, 1924, where I made the
                            remark that Article VII of the draft would put The Netherlands in a
                            considerably less favorable position than has been acquired under the
                            Convention concluded between The Netherlands and the United States on
                            August 6 [<hi rend="italic">26</hi>], 1852.</p>
                        <p>The Royal Government is pleased by learning from your note of July 11,
                            1924 that it is not apparent to you in what particulars this would be
                            the case, as this statement gives hope that there is some
                            misunderstanding on our side on [<hi rend="italic">of?</hi>] the real
                            tenor of Article VII. In order to clear up such possible
                            misunderstanding I take the liberty to explain further on what grounds
                            my Government is under the impression that our position as it is under
                            the treaty of 1852 would be injured by Article VII of the draft.</p>
                        <p>The letter and the whole spirit of the Convention of 1852 guarantee
                            unconditionally and in all respects reciprocal equality in relation to
                            the flags of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>This principle is maintained in paragraph 5 of Article VII of the draft
                            but only as far as imports and import duties are concerned, in contrast
                            to Article I of the Convention of 1852 where also exports and export
                            duties are mentioned and to the paragraphs 3 and 6 of Article VII of the
                            draft which extend most-favored-nation treatment also to goods
                            exported.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore paragraph 5 of Article VII applies the principle of
                            reciprocal equality in relation to the flags only to duties or charges
                            and not to “bounties, drawbacks and other privileges of this nature”
                            whereas the last paragraph of Article I of the Convention of 1852
                            explicitly stipulates that if such privileges are granted in the States
                            of either of the contracting parties on goods exported or imported in
                            national vessels, they shall also and in like manner be granted on goods
                            exported or imported in vessels of the other country.</p>
                        <p>So, as paragraph 5 of Article VII passes over in silence export duties
                            and the above mentioned privileges, the United States would be at
                            liberty to levy higher duties on articles exported from the United
                            States in vessels of The Netherlands than on the same articles exported
                            in vessels of the United States and further to allow for instance
                            special railroad fares in favor of goods having been imported or to be
                            exported in vessels of the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>In both respects—if our conception of Article VII is correct—this article
                            would place The Netherlands at a serious disadvantage in comparison with
                            our position under the Convention of 1852.</p>
                        <p>This, however, being apparently not the intention of the American
                            Government the Royal Government would appreciate a different wording of
                            paragraph 5 of Article VII so as to exclude also in the future any
                            possible misunderstanding. For this purpose my Government suggests to
                            substitute for this paragraph the following two paragraphs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“All articles which are or may be legally imported from foreign
                                    countries into ports of the United States or are or may be
                                    legally exported therefrom in vessels of the United States may
                                    likewise be imported into those ports or exported from those
                                    ports in vessels of The Netherlands without being liable to any
                                    other or higher duties or charges whatsoever than if such
                                    articles were imported or exported in vessels of the United
                                    States, and reciprocally, all articles which are or may be
                                    legally imported from foreign countries into ports of The
                                    Netherlands or are or may be legally exported therefrom in
                                    vessels of The Netherlands, may likewise be imported into these
                                    ports or exported from these ports in vessels of the United
                                    States without being liable to any other or higher duties or

                        <p>The second question whereto I am instructed to draw your attention bears
                            upon the last sentence of paragraph 1 of Article VII of the draft, where
                            is stipulated that nothing in the treaty shall be construed to restrict
                            the right of either High Contracting Party to impose, on such terms as
                            it may seem fit, prohibitions or restrictions of a sanitary character
                            designed to protect human, animal or plant life, or regulations for the
                            enforcement of police or revenue laws.</p>
                        <p>The Royal Government naturally does not discuss the right of every
                            Government to see that by importations no damage may be done to the
                            sanitary conditions of human beings, animals or plants. My Government is
                            convinced that precautions against such damage are fully justified but
                            in her opinion it is a universally accepted principle that measures to
                            this effect must be based on reasonable grounds and must be confined to
                            such precautions as are strictly necessary for the purpose they intend
                            to serve so that international trade is not affected in a higher degree
                            than is demanded by the sanitary requirements of a country.</p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>The Royal Government is under the impression that the policy followed by
                            the Department of Agriculture with regard to the importation in the
                            United States of plants, bulbs, et cetera from The Netherlands does not
                            fully reckon with the principle promised. On several produces of our
                            horticultural industry embargo has been laid and will be laid in the
                            near future although in the opinion of my Government on account of the
                            highly efficient phytopathological service in The Netherlands and the
                            proper methods taken to deal with plant disease within our own borders
                            less drastic measures would be sufficient for safeguarding plant life in
                            the United States against eventual infection by importations from The
                            Netherlands.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the unaccountably extreme character of the measures taken by
                            the American Government under the Plant Quarantine Act 1912,<note n="11" xml:id="d409fn11">37 Stat 315.</note> as well as other circumstances
                            give rise to serious doubt on the side of my Government whether these
                            measures are solely based on the wish to protect sanitary conditions of
                            plant life in the United States and have not at the same time the object
                            to lend economical protection to horticulture in the United States by
                            excluding all such foreign horticultural produces as might enter into
                            active competition with home products. It seems obvious to my Government
                            that measures if based on this motive and if taken to serve this
                            purpose, cannot be considered as “prohibitions or restrictions of a
                            sanitary character designed to protect plant life” and as such
                            admissible under the above mentioned clause of paragraph 1 of Article
                            VII of the drafted treaty.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons the Royal Government does not feel sure that as far as
                            the United States is concerned the interests of her highly important
                            foreign trade in horticultural produces will be sufficiently safe under
                            the said clause, and feels obliged to emphasise the necessity of adding
                            to the last sentence of paragraph 1 of Article VII another sentence of
                            about the following sense: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The High Contracting Parties, however, agree that the care for
                                    the sanitary conditions of plant life in either country shall
                                    not take such shape that for the purpose of barring the
                                    introduction of diseases, importation of plants, whether they
                                    are infected or not, is prohibited. On the contrary the
                                    importation in either country of plants and parts of plants in
                                    principle shall be allowed if reasonable guarantee is given that
                                    they are free from disease or noxious insects.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The exact wording of this addition may be susceptible of modification, on
                            an addition of this tenor the Royal Government has to insist.</p>
                        <p>Before entering into a discussion of other articles of the drafted treaty
                            my Government would appreciate to learn the opinion of the <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0580"/>American Government with regard to the

                            Grew’s letter of October 24, 1924 (So 711.562/13),<note n="13" xml:id="d410fn13">Not printed.</note> addressed to the late
                            Secretary of Agriculture, regarding the relation of plant quarantine
                            regulations to treaties of amity, commerce, and Consular rights, has
                            been received.</p>
                        <p>The change suggested by the Minister of the Netherlands appears to be
                            unnecessary, and in its present wording, is entirely unsatisfactory to
                            this Department. The promulgation of quarantines by this Department, as
                            they apply to plants and plant products, is for the sole purpose of
                            protecting this country from the entry and establishment of injurious
                            insects and plant diseases. The dangers attending shipments of plants
                            and plant products into the United States from the Netherlands have been
                            repeatedly brought to the attention of inspection officials of that
                            country, both directly and through your Department. Information on this
                            subject will be found in the late Secretary Wallace’s communications to
                            you of April 8 and July 21, 1922.<note n="13" xml:id="d410fn14">Not
                                printed.</note> Accompanying the latter communication was a copy of
                            a memorandum prepared by Dr. C. L. Marlatt, Chairman of the Federal
                            Horticultural Board, which included a brief list of “European Bulb Pests
                            which May Become General Crop Enemies”.<note n="13" xml:id="d410fn15">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The paragraph which you transmitted to the Minister of the Netherlands on
                            January 9, 1924 appears to cover the subject fully, and is satisfactory
                            to this Department. It is understood that the “prohibitions or
                            restrictions of a sanitary character” are for the purpose of excluding
                            insects and plant diseases, the entry and establishment of which would
                            represent a menace to the country concerned.</p>

                            accompanied by about three assistants. It is understood that his
                            contract will be similar to his former contract. The compensation of his
                            assistants has not yet been fixed, but it is believed that Hill can
                            estimate roughly the total amount which will be necessary to meet their
                            salaries and expenses for about three months. The Department was most
                            unfavorably impressed by the delay which occurred in the payment of
                            Dodds’ salary two years ago and it must insist on this occasion on the
                            full cooperation of its appointee on the High Commission, in order to
                            assure the prompt payment of all sums due both to Dodds and his
                            assistants. Please show this cable to Hill and say that the Department
                            desires that he should either recognize these charges as a definite
                            obligation against the funds available to the High Commission or else
                            arrange with the Government to have other funds set aside for this

                            instruction No. 102, of October 8, 1923,<note n="4" xml:id="d413fn4"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_607"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p.
                                    607</ref>.</note> the Department contemplates the withdrawal of
                            the Legation Guard from Managua after the inauguration of the new
                            administration in January, 1925. It is believed that the withdrawal of
                            the Marines can be effected with less danger of disorder in Nicaragua if
                            the forthcoming elections are conducted in a manner which leaves no room
                            for doubt that the successful candidate has the support of a real
                            majority of the people. It is therefore desired that the Legation should
                            exert every proper influence to bring about the holding of free and fair
                            elections under the new electoral law. The employment of Dr. Dodds and
                            his assistants during the registration period will doubtless materially
                            assist the Nicaraguan authorities in conducting this part of the
                            elections in a satisfactory manner, and the Department hopes that the
                            Nicaraguan Government may also decide to employ electoral experts at the
                            time of the voting itself. It feels, however, that it will also be
                            necessary that the Legation should cooperate with the electoral experts
                            and the Nicaraguan authorities, and it desires to receive from the
                            Legation frequent and full reports regarding all matters connected with
                            the election and the campaign.</p>
                        <p>Since the preparation of the reports requires a very large amount of time
                            and would involve a careful study of the electoral law and the electoral
                            procedure, the Department suggests that you should instruct the
                            Secretary of the Legation, Mr. Walter C. Thurston, to devote himself
                            exclusively to the above described work until after the elections. In
                            order to obtain the necessary information, it would seem desirable that
                            Mr. Thurston should be in a position to communicate directly with the
                            officials of the Nicaraguan Government regarding matters concerned with
                            the elections. It is desired of course that Mr. Thurston should confer
                            with you upon all questions which may arise and should keep you fully
                            advised of his activities.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that Mr. Thurston should also keep in close touch with Dr.
                            Dodds and his assistants during the approaching registration period,
                            exerting any proper influence with the Nicaraguan officials to
                            facilitate their work. After the registration period it is desired that
                            he should obtain the fullest information about the manner in which
                            protests arising in connection with the registration are dealt with, and
                            about the methods employed by the various political parties in their
                            campaigns. It is desired that you should transmit <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0583"/>his reports fully and frequently to the
                            Department, using the telegraph where necessary, advising the Department
                            at the same time of such recommendations as he may deem advisable
                            regarding action to be taken to insure the holding of free and fair
                            elections. He may make his reports to you over his own signature.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that the Legation should use its influence in an
                            informal and friendly manner to obtain fair treatment for all parties in
                            the forthcoming elections. It does not desire that either you or Mr.
                            Thurston should make formal recommendations or protests to the
                            Nicaraguan authorities without first transmitting all of the facts in
                            the case to the Department and obtaining its instructions.</p>
                        <p>In order that the Government may be informed of the assignment of Mr.
                            Thurston to this work, so that it may extend to him all necessary
                            facilities, the Department desires that you should deliver the following
                            note to the Minister of Foreign Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In my note of (here insert date of note transmitted in
                                    accordance with Department’s instruction of October 8) I
                                    referred to the gratification and sympathetic appreciation with
                                    which my Government had noted the steps taken by the Nicaraguan
                                    Government to assure freedom and fairness in the approaching
                                    elections, and I stated that my Government would be glad to be
                                    of assistance to the authorities of Nicaragua in procuring the
                                    services of experts to aid in the application of the new
                                    electoral law. I wish further to inform Your Excellency that my
                                    Government desires to cooperate with the Nicaraguan Government
                                    in making the work of these experts as fruitful as possible.
                                    With this end in view I have instructed the Secretary of this
                                    Legation, Mr. Walter C. Thurston, to make a careful study of the
                                    new electoral law and of the problems which may arise in its
                                    application.</p>
                                <p>“I hope that Mr. Thurston may be permitted to confer upon any
                                    questions which may arise, not only with Your Excellency and the
                                    other officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but also
                                    with other officials who may be more directly concerned with the
                                    conduct of the elections, in order that he may obtain all
                                    pertinent information and may be of any possible assistance in
                                    connection with the work of Dr. Dodds or in the solution of the
                                    problems which may arise after Dr. Dodds’ departure.”</p>

                        <p>34. Your March 18, 11 a.m. and March 25, 10 a.m.<note n="7" xml:id="d416fn7">Neither printed.</note> This Government is
                            gratified at the steps so far taken by the Nicaraguan Government to make
                            possible the holding of free and fair elections next October. It has
                            learned with pleasure of the satisfactory progress of the registration
                            of voters and of the impartiality with which this registration appears
                            to have been carried out. The prompt action of President Martinez in
                            checking police interference and recruiting, which might have tended to
                            intimidate opposition voters, shows his desire to comply strictly with
                            his announced determination that his successor should be elected under
                            conditions of absolute freedom.</p>
                        <p>It has been evident, however, that the unfamiliarity of the local
                            electoral officials with the provisions of the new electoral law has
                            created certain difficulties in the administration of the law which make
                            evident the desirability of giving the national electoral board <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0585"/>such technical assistance as
                            will assure the proper execution of the law from a technical standpoint.
                            The failure of some of the departmental boards to report the division of
                            electoral cantons and organization of the local directorios within the
                            time required by law, and the delay in printing and distributing the
                            registration books, are examples of the administrative difficulties
                            which have arisen. A repetition of difficulties of this nature during
                            the preparations for the actual voting in October might easily defeat
                            the Government’s purpose to hold truly free elections and might thus
                            cause some doubt as to whether the administration coming into office as
                            the result of the elections was representative of the will of the
                            majority of the people.</p>
                        <p>In its desire to assist President Martinez in holding the forthcoming
                            elections under conditions which will make possible the withdrawal of
                            the Legation Guard without danger of subsequent disturbances in
                            Nicaragua, this Government desires to suggest to the Nicaraguan
                            Government the advisability of retaining the services of one of Dr.
                            Dodds’ assistants as technical adviser to the electoral authorities from
                            now until next October. It hopes that President Martinez may see fit to
                            conclude arrangements to this end.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you should call upon President Martinez,
                            accompanied by Thurston and Dodds, and present the above in the form of
                            a memorandum, explaining the desirability of retaining one of Dodds
                            assistants until the elections, and urging that this action be taken in
                            order that all parties in Nicaragua may have adequate assurance that the
                            electoral law will be satisfactorily complied with. Reply by cable.</p>

                        <p>82. You will please present the following note to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I am instructed by my Government to state to Your Excellency
                                    that the Government of the United States has learned with much
                                    satisfaction <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0586"/>of the
                                    steps taken by the Nicaraguan Government to assure free and fair
                                    elections to the Nicaraguan people. The first step in this
                                    direction was the invitation to Doctor Harold W. Dodds to draw
                                    up an electoral law. This law was duly enacted by the Nicaraguan
                                    Congress and as a second step the Nicaraguan Government invited
                                    Doctor Dodds and certain assistants to come to Nicaragua during
                                    the early period of registration and one of Doctor Dodds’
                                    assistants was contracted with to remain until after the
                                    elections.</p>
                                <p>My Government learned with gratification that under the new
                                    electoral law a greater proportion of voters has been registered
                                    than ever before in Nicaragua. The carrying out of the
                                    registration demonstrated, however, the many difficulties
                                    encountered in the administration tor the first time of such an
                                    important measure as an electoral law, the provisions of which
                                    were new and unfamiliar alike to the officials administering it
                                    as to the public which was exercising its rights under this law
                                    for the first time.</p>
                                <p>My Government was pleased to learn that Doctor Dodds and his
                                    assistants were of great value in helping the Nicaraguan
                                    officials to find satisfactory solutions for many of the
                                    questions which came up in connection with the administration of
                                    this law. It has been evident, however, that the unfamiliarity
                                    of the local electoral officials with the provisions of the new
                                    electoral law has created certain difficulties in the
                                    administration thereof which makes evident the desirability of
                                    continuing the help which Doctor Dodds and his assistants were
                                    able to render during the months of February, March and April of
                                    this year. Therefore, in its desire to prevent a repetition of
                                    the difficulties experienced during the period of registration
                                    which, should they occur during the preparations for and the
                                    actual voting in October, might easily defeat the Government’s
                                    purpose to hold truly free elections and in order to assist
                                    President Martinez in holding the forthcoming elections under
                                    conditions which will remove any doubt that the administration
                                    coming into office as the result of the elections is
                                    representative of the will of the majority of the people and
                                    thus merits the recognition of this and other Governments, and
                                    in order to make possible the withdrawal of the Legation Guard
                                    in January, 1925, without danger of subsequent disturbances in
                                    Nicaragua, my Government desires to suggest to the Nicaraguan
                                    Government the advisability of requesting Doctor Dodds to come
                                    to Nicaragua the middle of September with sufficient assistants
                                    to permit him to be of the utmost help to the Nicaraguan
                                    Government in carrying out its pledges of free and fair
                                    election. My Government feels that one assistant in each of the
                                    thirteen electoral districts with an additional assistant to
                                    help Doctor Dodds in his work of advising the central government
                                    should be sufficient and it accordingly suggests that an
                                    invitation be extended to Doctor Dodds to come to Nicaragua the
                                    middle of September to remain for approximately a month.</p>
                                <p>In making this suggestion my Government desires me to make it
                                    clear that it is highly sensible of the assurances given by the
                                    Nicaraguan Government for the proper conduct of the approaching
                                    elections and that it fully appreciates and is most gratified by
                                    the evidence already given by the Nicaraguan Government of its
                                    intention of fulfilling these pledges. My Government’s
                                    suggestion must therefore in no wise be considered as a sign of
                                    lack of confidence in <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0587"/>the intention of the Nicaraguan Government. On the contrary my
                                    Government has every confidence and expectation that the
                                    Nicaraguan Government will loyally carry out its obligations in
                                    this respect. My Government, however, is most anxious that there
                                    be no question regarding the claim of the person coming into
                                    office as the result of the forthcoming elections to the
                                    recognition of this and the neighboring Republics as the
                                    constitutionally elected President of Nicaragua. My Government
                                    is also, as Your Excellency is well aware, most anxious to
                                    withdraw the Legation Guard upon the installation of the new
                                    government on January 1, 1925, without in any wise jeopardizing
                                    the normal course of the affairs in the Republic and that this
                                    withdrawal shall not be a cause for unrest and disturbance.
                                    Having seen the difficult problems presented during the
                                    registration by the administration of the law the workings of
                                    which are as yet unfamiliar to the officials and electorate of
                                    Nicaragua, and having seen the invaluable assistance given by
                                    Doctor Dodds and his assistants in overcoming these difficulties
                                    my Government has felt that it could be of very considerable
                                    help to the Nicaraguan Government in carrying out its pledges by
                                    helping it to obtain the advice and counsel of Doctor Dodds and
                                    his necessary assistants.”</p>

                        <p>159. Legation’s 157 and 158 of August 6. Inasmuch as I was unable to
                            reconcile the purport of the Foreign Minister’s note with his assurance
                            that it did not definitely reject Department’s proposal as contained in
                            its no. 82, July 16, 4 p.m., I called on the President today. He said
                            positively that the note expressed Nicaragua’s definite and final
                            refusal to accept Department’s suggestion that Nicaragua engage Dodds
                            and his assistants to come here and assist in the elections.</p>
                        <p>Since the note lays special stress upon the futility of supervising
                            elections with only 14 people, I asked him if it would be desirable to
                            have a more elaborate supervision made at the expense of our Government.
                            He replied that even an extensive supervision would prove ineffective,
                            and that he would be obliged to consult his Cabinet before he could
                            speak on the advisability of a supervision which was unsought. My
                            impression was that such a policy would be opposed by him. …</p>

                        <p>93. Your 158, August 6, 6 p.m. As stated in the Department’s 82, July 16,
                            4 p.m., arrangements should be made with Dodds by August 10, in order
                            that he may make the proper arrangements with his collaborators in ample
                            time for him to sail for Nicaragua on August 28. You will please urge
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs and, should you deem it advisable, the
                            President, to have the necessary arrangements made without delay. The
                            Department does not wish to seem too insistent but in view of the very
                            short time intervening before Dodds will have to leave if he is to
                            arrive in Nicaragua <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0589"/>before the
                            elections, definite arrangements cannot longer be postponed. You will of
                            course understand the Department would very much rather have Dodds go to
                            Nicaragua at the invitation of the Nicaraguan Government than to have
                            him go on behalf of this Government. The Department feels that the
                            Nicaraguan Government would also prefer to have Dodds come to Nicaragua
                            at their invitation. You will please use all proper efforts to have the
                            matter concluded promptly.</p>

                        <p>160. My 159, August 7, 3 p.m. President Martinez called me to the White
                            House last night and handed me the following memorandum: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Memorandum of the President of the Republic for the American
                                    Chargé d’Affaires ad interim. The honorable American Chargé
                                    d’Affaires ad interim orally inquired of the President of the
                                    Republic on the 7th instant what would be the attitude of the
                                    Nicaraguan Government if, in view of the refusal by the
                                    Government of Nicaragua to accept the proposal to send Doctor
                                    Dodds with 14 assistants to supervise the next elections, the
                                    Government of the United States should decide to send at its
                                    cost a sufficient number of American marines or civilians for
                                    the purpose of observing said elections.</p>
                                <p>The President offered to submit this delicate question for the
                                    resolution of the Cabinet. This having met this morning resolved
                                    in agreement with the President in the following form: That if
                                    said persons come, whether they be civilians or regular forces,
                                    the Government will maintain its refusal and will assume the
                                    attitude, if the case arrives, which best serves the interests
                                    of Nicaragua. If they come in private character they will be
                                    guaranteed all the rights which the constitution and laws of the
                                    country authorize to foreigners. Presidential House, Managua,
                                    August 8th.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The foregoing version of my inquiry is sufficiently accurate for
                            acceptance with the exception of the reference to marines. I did not
                            specify the character of the probable supervisors. I should prefer
                            nevertheless if supervision is decided upon that marines be
                            employed.</p>
                        <p>The heavy pressure of my work at this moment prevents me from presenting
                            here certain recommendations which I beg to be permitted to make to the
                            Department in connection with this problem. I shall endeavor to submit
                            my suggestions by cable on Monday.</p>

                        <p>111. If you consider it advisable you are authorized to ask the Commander
                            of the Legation Guard to send a few reliable Marines to important
                            centers outside of Managua at the time of the elections in order to help
                            you obtain information about the manner in which the elections are
                            carried on. The Department is most anxious that you should obtain the
                            most full information about the conduct of the elections and it leaves
                            the manner of obtaining this information to your discretion. It realizes
                            that it will be exceedingly difficult for you to obtain full information
                            with the resources at your disposal.</p>
                        <p>The Department considers it extremely important that if the Marines are
                            used they should be very fully instructed that the object of sending
                            them to the places chosen by you is merely for observation and that they
                            must scrupulously limit their actions to observation only and must in no
                            case take any action in favor of or against any of the political parties
                            nor should they undertake any functions <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0591"/>whatsoever in connection with the conduct of the
                            elections. They are merely to observe conditions and make report thereof
                            to you.</p>
                        <p>Do you consider that it would be advisable or helpful for you or for the
                            Department to issue a public statement shortly before the elections to
                            the effect that the United States is carefully observing the manner in
                            which the elections are conducted in order that it may have at hand
                            adequate information to enable it to determine whether it can
                            consistently recognize the new administration on January 1? Please cable

                        <p>197. I was called to the White House yesterday morning by President
                            Martinez who during our conversation unexpectedly inquired whether I
                            would be willing to designate a number of marines from the Legation
                            guard to observe the elections and examine the election returns
                            submitted to the departmental boards of election before these boards
                            make the count of the votes. I replied that I was certain that my
                            Government would be disposed now as it had previously shown itself to
                            be, to lend all assistance requested in connection with the elections
                            but that I would of course have to obtain the Department’s authorization
                            before permitting members of the Legation guard to take active part in
                            the electoral process. I also requested a memorandum in confirmation of
                            the request.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after returning to the Legation the Department’s 111, September
                            25, 5 p.m., arrived and last night the President’s memorandum was
                            received stating that in a Cabinet meeting it had been resolved that I
                            should convoke a meeting of the directive boards of the three political
                            parties in order that they should agree in common to “consent” to the
                            utility of 13 marines without official character to witness the election
                            and take note of all electoral documents before the departmental boards
                            of election make the count of the votes and to render report thereon to
                            me. Council of Ministers distorted the matter and not only made it
                            appear that I had reopened the question of supervision but placed me in
                            the position of requesting approval thereof by the political parties. I
                            accordingly called on the President this morning and informed him that I
                            could not call a meeting of the party organizations nor could I engage
                            the marines to take active part in the elections without specific
                            instructions. I added, having learned from the commander of the Legation
                            guard that men were available for such use, that I did <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0592"/>intend at any event to distribute a
                            number of marines at certain selected places who would merely observe
                            the election and report thereon to me. The President then stated that
                            after having sent his note to me he realized that I might find it
                            inconvenient to take the action suggested and that he now felt that a
                            better plan would be for the parties to request the Legation to utilize
                            the marines in the manner described. I replied that insofar as the
                            Legation was concerned a simple request from the Government would
                            suffice but that if he wished to take the matter up beforehand with the
                            parties he should do so. I understand that the President is today
                            discussing the matter with the parties.</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be unwise to allow the marines, who can not now be
                            adequately instructed in the provisions of the electoral law, to attempt
                            to examine the electoral documents in the manner proposed or to attempt
                            any other participation in the election and I accordingly respectfully
                            recommend that if a petition for such participation should be received
                            by me I be authorized to refuse.</p>

                            correctly interpreted its views and it authorizes you to make the reply
                            which you suggest. It desires that the Marines should avoid any
                            participation which would seem to make them at all responsible for the
                            conduct of the elections, but it believes that it would be helpful to
                            have them present in order to supply you with accurate information about

                        <p>201. My 197 and 198 September 27th and 28th [<hi rend="italic">29th</hi>]. The Minister for Foreign Affairs called Monday to inform me
                            that the efforts to have the political parties request that the marines
                            participate in the electoral process had failed. He then stated that the
                            President had asked him to suggest to me that the marines to be sent out
                            as observers should wear civilian dress. I objected to this and the
                            suggestion apparently was withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>That evening I sent a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs giving the
                            names of the members of the Legation guard to be employed and their
                            destinations and requesting that orders be issued to the authorities of
                            those places to afford them the protection necessary to the fulfillment
                            of their mission. Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs called
                            again and on behalf of the President insisted that the marines wear
                            civilian dress and insinuated that otherwise their employment as
                            observers would be opposed. He advised me that political use was being
                            made by Chamorro of their employment which was detrimental. I promised a
                            final answer by 4 o’clock yesterday afternoon and discussed the matter
                            with the commander of the Legation guard who feels as I strongly feel
                            that to send the marines out in civilian clothes on election day with
                            conditions as they undoubtedly will be on that day would be to invite
                            serious trouble. It was therefore agreed that I should refuse to employ
                            the marines unless they should be in uniform and be guaranteed
                            protection. However before I was able to arrange an interview with him I
                            received a long note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs which stated
                            definitely that the President desired that the marines should go out
                            “not as marines, nor with official character of any kind, nor wearing
                            the uniform of any corps, but as simple private in the common clothing
                            of civilians who intend to witness the election without taking any part
                            therein, otherwise he should have the painful obligation to manifest his
                            frank disapproval.”</p>

                            concern with which this Government has learned of the creation of a
                            large new armed force to be used in connection with the elections. It
                            does not of course question the President’s intention to place this
                            force under the sole control of the Cantonal Directorios, since any
                            other course could only be construed as an attempt to control the
                            election by military pressure. It fears, however, that local
                            administrative officials may not fully comprehend the necessity for
                            giving the Cantonal Directorios absolute freedom in the disposition of
                            this force on election day, and it hopes that the President will issue
                            the strictest orders to such officials to abide by the provisions of the
                            electoral law, in order to avoid any semblance of police

                        <p>117. Your 201, October 1, 8 a.m. You will please address the following
                            note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to his quoted in your
                            telegram under reference: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I am instructed by my Government to inform Your Excellency that
                                    it has learned with surprise that the Nicaraguan Government
                                    having requested American Marines to observe the conduct of the
                                    elections, has now declined to have them sent unless they go in
                                    civilian clothes. Your Excellency will understand that it is
                                    impossible for members of the Legation Guard to undertake the
                                    work originally requested by the President except in uniform.
                                    This is obvious for many reasons not the least of which is the
                                    protection of the men themselves. Should the Marines not be in
                                    uniform it is highly possible that despite the greatest good
                                    will and best intentions of the Nicaraguan Government, their
                                    identity might not be clear to the local officials and
                                    regrettable incidents might occur. My Government therefore will
                                    not permit the use of the Marines in the manner requested by
                                    President Martinez unless they are in uniform.</p>
                                <p>In communicating the decision of my Government to you I am
                                    instructed to state that the desire of my Government throughout
                                    has been to lend its advice, assistance and cooperation to the
                                    Nicaraguan Government merely with a view to promote peace, order
                                    and constitutional government in the Republic. In informing the
                                    Nicaraguan <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0595"/>Government
                                    of the Department’s intention to withdraw the Legation Guard on
                                    January 1, next, the Legation stated, under instructions from
                                    the Department of State, that the United States Government had
                                    been gratified by the steps already taken to assure freedom and
                                    fairness in the approaching elections, the foremost of which was
                                    the enactment of the electoral law. My Government hoped that
                                    should this step be followed by such effective measures during
                                    the electoral period as would insure a free expression of the
                                    will of the people all parties would willingly accept the
                                    Government resulting from the elections as the constitutional
                                    government in Nicaragua with the support of the people of
                                    Nicaragua. Such a condition would permit the withdrawal of the
                                    American Marines upon the inauguration of that Government
                                    without danger to the peace and internal order of Nicaragua.</p>
                                <p>It was purely in order to help the Nicaraguan Government in this
                                    most important measure that after the desire of the Nicaraguan
                                    Government for free and fair elections had been shown by
                                    inviting Mr. Dodds to draw up the electoral law and enacting it
                                    that the Department gave its subsequent advice and counsel for
                                    the carrying out of the necessary supplemental measures to this
                                    end. Accordingly my Government suggested that the Nicaraguan
                                    Government consider the advisability of asking Mr. Dodds to go
                                    to Nicaragua to assist in the installation of this new electoral
                                    system which was unfamiliar alike to the officials charged with
                                    its enforcement as to the Nicaraguan, electorate which will
                                    exercise its rights according to its provisions. Mr. Dodds was
                                    invited to help during the period of registration and his
                                    assistance at that time proved to be invaluable. The Government
                                    of the United States therefore suggested that the Nicaraguan
                                    Government consider the desirability of inviting Mr. Dodds to
                                    carry this work to its logical conclusion by assisting during
                                    the actual electoral period. The Nicaraguan Government after it
                                    first apparently arrived at the same conclusion decided not to
                                    act upon this suggestion. On further consideration, however,
                                    your Government requested me to permit members of the Legation
                                    Guard to help in the carrying out of the electoral law by
                                    verifying electoral documents and counting the ballots. As I had
                                    the honor to inform you at the time my Government stated that it
                                    could not permit members of the Legation Guard to take any
                                    participation in the conduct of the elections but would be
                                    willing to permit them to go to places in the Republic chosen by
                                    me merely for observation. My Government has felt that the
                                    elections should be conducted wholly by the Nicaraguan
                                    Government or by such technical experts as it might care to
                                    contract for.</p>
                                <p>It is thus abundantly clear that the attitude of the United
                                    States Government throughout has been to give its advice and
                                    counsel, and assistance if so requested, on behalf of peace,
                                    order and constitutional government and its advice was always
                                    with a view to help Nicaragua to conduct the elections in such a
                                    manner that the authority of the Government resulting therefrom
                                    will not be disputed by any serious elements in Nicaragua and
                                    that the new Government of Nicaragua can consistently be
                                    recognized by the Government of the United States as the
                                    constitutional government of Nicaragua. My Government although
                                    it feels that it has fulfilled to the utmost its obligation to
                                    Nicaragua as a friendly sister republic in giving <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0596"/>the counsel above outlined is
                                    nevertheless ready to give any further proper assistance and
                                    advice but it regrets that it cannot for the reasons given
                                    accede to the present request of the Nicaraguan Government that
                                    American Marines be used in civilian dress in the manner
                                    indicated.</p>
                                <p>The responsibility now therefore rests entirely with the
                                    Nicaraguan Government.”</p>

                        <p>219. The note containing the Department’s instruction number 117, October
                            2, 7 p.m. was presented on October 3d to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs from whom I have received a note in reply consisting of 23 pages
                            and 45 sheets of digest.</p>
                        <p>After the usual recapitulation of the Legation’s note and brief reference
                            to the proposed employment of marines to observe the elections the
                            remainder of the note is devoted to a detailed and voluminous
                            description of the attitude of the Government during the electoral
                            period which is qualified as having been eminently impartial and
                            commendable. In this connection the assertion is made that the Executive
                            considers the legality of the elections to be indisputable.</p>
                        <p>The note also states that elections took place with admirable liberty,
                            impartiality and order with the exception of Chontales where
                            deliberately provoked disturbances were suffocated immediately. This
                            statement is interesting when it is recalled that the state of siege was
                            established because of those disturbances and is still in effect
                            although the country has been tranquil since noon October 5th.</p>
                        <p>Unless the Department desires a more extensive report on this note by
                            telegraph I shall send it by mail.</p>

                        <p>236. Department’s 134, November 5, 6 p.m.<note n="11" xml:id="d434fn11">Not printed.</note> In a signed statement presented to me yesterday
                            by Adolfo Diaz in his capacity as president of the directive junta of
                            the Conservative Party it is <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0597"/>asserted that elections in certain cantons of the Departments of
                            Managua, Masaya, Granada, Chontales, Nueva Segovia, Jinotega, Esteli and
                            Matagalpa, have been protested before the courts in conformity with the
                            provisions of article 92 of the Electoral Law. It is further asserted in
                            this statement and Diaz has personally so informed me that while such
                            protests should be made generally his party is not presenting them
                            because it fears that the new elections if held would be more
                            drastically controlled than the last unless supervised. That his
                            contention is not without justification may be deduced from the fact
                            that the pro-government president of the Chamber of Deputies having been
                            defeated for reelection at San Juan del Norte on October 5th, new
                            elections were held there on the following Sunday by Executive order on
                            the pretext that the election board had not taken oath of office,
                            without any reference of the matter to the national board of elections,
                            and the deputy concerned was victorious by a majority of 41 votes as
                            against 21 for his opponents. The results of the first election were 70
                            votes for his opponents as against 25 for him. As a result of the
                            disturbances at San José de los Remates on October 5th new elections
                            also took place there and although 499 voters were registered the new
                            elections according to the report published in the newspapers gave the
                            transaction [<hi rend="italic">Transactionist</hi>] candidate the
                            victory by 59 votes as against 39 for the Conservative candidate, a
                            total of 98.</p>
                        <p>Election figures today total 75,835 of which Solorzano has 41,075,
                            Chamorro 26,566 and Corea 7, 184. There are 84 cantons still to report
                            of which 44 correspond to Bluefields.</p>

                        <p>151. Your telegram 250, November 28, 11 a.m., and previous sections, and
                            your despatch 387, November 5.<note n="12" xml:id="d435fn12">Neither

                        <p>The Department has very carefully considered the whole Nicaraguan
                            electoral situation. It feels that it is not feasible to demand new
                            elections because it is not in a position to take the strong measures
                            necessary to insure compliance with the demand and even should the
                            Government readily consent to new elections they would be valueless
                            unless very closely supervised by this Government which would also mean
                            armed intervention which is not to be contemplated. The Department has
                            also given consideration to the question of suggesting the appointment
                            of a designado and a coalition <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0598"/>cabinet in which all parties will have a voice, this provisional
                            government to hold new elections. This also is impracticable for the
                            reasons mentioned above and because it does not seem likely that a
                            coalition government in Nicaragua, should the suggestion meet with the
                            support of all factions, would have any more chance of success than did
                            a similar attempt in Honduras.</p>
                        <p>The Department is therefore disposed to raise no question regarding the
                            validity of the elections and to continue normal diplomatic relations
                            with the Solorzano Government upon its inauguration in January. The
                            Department furthermore feels that it would be well to receive certain
                            assurances from Señor Solorzano before making known to him its decision
                            above stated. While the Department does not feel that it would be well
                            to insist upon a formal promise that the 1928 campaign and elections
                            shall be supervised by this Government as the Department does not desire
                            to make any definite commitment at this time concerning its action four
                            years hence, the Department would be glad to receive from Señor
                            Solorzano assurances that the 1928 elections will be carried out in full
                            freedom and fairness for all parties and strictly in accordance with the
                            provisions of the Dodds electoral law and that the latter will not be
                            modified except in strict accordance with the advice of Doctor Dodds or
                            another suitable electoral expert. Although the Department feels that
                            Señor Solorzano would perhaps be well advised to obtain the cooperation
                            of as many political elements in Nicaragua as possible in his Government
                            it does not feel that an imposed coalition cabinet, for the reasons
                            given above, would be a success. The Department feels that the immediate
                            formation of a constabulary will promote the peace of the country and
                            that equally important is the satisfactory solution of the economic
                            problems now confronting Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>You may therefore discuss the matter with Señor Solorzano stating as your
                            personal opinion that a definite, formal, written engagement on his part
                            to the Legation, that immediately upon assuming office he will form a
                            constabulary in order to provide suitable means to maintain order upon
                            the withdrawal of the American Marines for which he will request the
                            assistance of this Government in its training and organization, as well
                            as a statement that he will undertake adequate and satisfactory measures
                            with which the Government of the United States could cooperate in the
                            solution of Nicaragua’s economic problems and an engagement regarding
                            the 1928 elections as set forth in the preceding paragraph, might prove
                            a deciding element in determining this Government not to raise any
                            question as to the validity of the election and to carry on normal
                            diplomatic relations with his Government upon its inauguration on
                            January 1.</p>
                        <p>You may also suggest to Señor Solorzano that he consider the expediency
                            of obtaining the cooperation of as many political elements <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0599"/>in Nicaragua as possible in forming his
                            Government. While using the utmost care that it shall be definitely
                            understood by Señor Solorzano that it is not a condition precedent to
                            recognition by this Government that he form a coalition cabinet you may
                            nevertheless, in your discretion, should such be the desire of Señor
                            Solorzano, exert your good offices in an endeavor to bring about a
                            reconciliation between him and the other political elements in Nicaragua
                            which will assure their support of his administration. The Department
                            will welcome any suggestions from you as to any other measures which you
                            or the Department might take in composing the situation in
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The Department has been approached by the Guatemalan Minister with the
                            request, on behalf of his Government, that he be informed as to the
                            Department’s attitude in the Nicaraguan situation as the Guatemalan
                            Government desires to take similar action. Please telegraph immediately
                            Señor Solorzano has given you the assurances regarding the constabulary
                            and the economic and electoral situation as outlined above, upon receipt
                            of which the Department will, should the assurances be satisfactory,
                            inform the Guatemalan Government that it does not propose to raise any
                            question regarding the validity of the elections and will carry on
                            diplomatic relations with Señor Solorzano upon his inauguration. The
                            Department will then also instruct you to inform General Chamorro of its
                            attitude regarding the elections and that not only will any
                            revolutionary movement on his part meet with the Department’s decided
                            disapproval but that the constituted government will receive its moral
                            support.</p>

                        <p>62. You are instructed to call on President Martinez and say to him
                            privately that the Department views with concern the persistent reports
                            that he intends to run for office to succeed himself. The Government of
                            the United States does not wish to intervene in Nicaraguan domestic
                            affairs, and is impartial towards political parties and candidates
                            therein. However, on January 1st next it will have to decide whether it
                            can consistently extend its recognition to the new administration as the
                            constitutional government of Nicaragua. It is its desire that no
                            question should arise at that time regarding the eligibility of the one
                            who shall have been elected President. It desires that the situation
                            should afford an opportunity for this Government to extend to the new
                            Government its fullest and most sympathetic cooperation. After a
                            thorough study of the question the Government of the United States feels
                            itself constrained to express the view that it would be contrary to the
                            Constitution of Nicaragua if a person holding the office of President
                            during the next preceding term should be elected President.<note n="13" xml:id="d437fn13">See art. 104 of the Constitution, <ref target="frus1912#pg_997"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            instructed to assure him that its decision is based solely upon its
                            policy concerning the recognition of new governments and is not due to
                            any personal objection to him. You may assure him that this Government
                            has the highest regard for him. You may add that you have been
                            instructed to take up this matter with him privately, and that you are
                            not informing anyone else of what has taken place, not even the other
                            members of the Legation staff, because the Department does not desire to
                            cause him any embarrassment or permit its action to come to the
                            attention of his political opponents.</p>
                        <p>If you so desire, you may let him see the translation of your
                            instruction. Cable result of your interview.</p>

                        <p>102. On evening May 30 I visited President Martinez and read to him
                            Spanish translation of your 62 May 29, 5 p.m. He seemed neither
                            displeased nor surprised, but he did show an unchanged intention to
                            become a candidate according to the conditions which are described
                            below. He asked me to notify the Department that he has not accepted the
                            Presidential nomination which was offered to him on May 25, and would
                            not unless the Liberal Party should ratify it. If, however, the Liberal
                            Party should ratify it, he would accept the nomination, since he
                            believed from reports of eminent American attorneys acting in his behalf
                            in Washington that in that case our Government would approve his
                            candidacy; that his policy thus to unite the Conservative and Liberal
                            Parties offered the only way to avoid civil war. He said he had received
                            the opinion of 15 attorneys that under article 100 of the new election
                            law (Spanish version) he could become a candidate for Senator; after his
                            election he could admit his disqualifications, band over his office to
                            the Vice President; the latter would then bring about a new election at
                            which he would be legally elected. He did not desire to take such a
                            course, and he intimated that if our Government should continue to view
                            his candidacy in an unfavorable light, he would withdraw.</p>

                        <p>66. You are instructed to say to the President that the Government of the
                            United States desires to remove all doubt as to its attitude as set
                            forth in its May 29, 5 p.m. It would regard his election as
                            unconstitutional, and upon the expiration of his present term would be
                            highly indisposed to extend its recognition to him as Constitutional
                            President. Due to its high personal regard for him, the Government of
                            the United States has conveyed its views to him privately and
                            confidentially in order not to embarrass him. Should it become clear,
                            however, that he is an active candidate to succeed himself, the
                            Government of the United States would be compelled, because of the dire
                            consequences which might result from his course, to give due
                            consideration to the advisability of making its views public so that
                            there may arise no grounds for a misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>If you think it advisable you may say also, but not as an instruction
                            from the Department, that your Government is in possession of
                            information that wholly false reports have been sent to him by a number
                            of his advisers who have come to Washington. You will recall to him that
                            on several occasions the Department deemed it necessary to instruct its
                            Legation to correct misleading statements regarding the attitude of the
                            Department.</p>

                                    is hostile to no candidate; it desires only that free and fair

                                    be expressed without hindrance at the polls. My Government feels
                                    that the transference of the center of political activity of
                                    Nicaragua to Washington would be detrimental to that
                                    Government’s interests and this Government therefore cannot

                            receipt of the Department’s confidential circular instruction, of August
                            18, 1923, (diplomatic serial number 211, file number 611.0031.)<note n="16" xml:id="d442fn16"><ref target="frus1923v01#pg_131"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 131</ref>.</note> respecting the
                            inclusion of an unconditional most-favored-nation clause in a commercial
                            treaty with Nicaragua, and to say that the insertion of such a clause
                            would appear to be desirable and should meet with no opposition.</p>
                        <p>During my conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding
                            the proposed Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Consular Rights, mentioned in
                            the Department’s cable instruction number 44, of September 20, 6
                                p.m.,<note n="17" xml:id="d442fn17">Not printed.</note> I received
                            the impression that the Government of Nicaragua would be very gratified
                            by the conclusion of such a treaty, and would leave in our hands the
                            formulation of the greater part of its provisions—although it probably
                            would not fail to propose certain clauses.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the proposed Treaty, I have the honor to report that
                            there is said to exist between the Governments of France and Nicaragua
                            an agreement whereunder special import rates are accorded by the former
                            to Nicaraguan coffee. I do not know what reciprocal privilege is granted
                            any French products, but I will endeavor to ascertain the terms of the
                            agreement and submit a further report.</p>
                        <p>Another matter which should, perhaps, receive the Department’s
                            consideration when arranging for the conclusion of the Treaty with
                            Nicaragua is the peculiar situation which exists by reason of the
                            several financial plans.<note n="18" xml:id="d442fn18">The reference is
                                to several financial agreements made in 1920 between the Government
                                of Nicaragua and the two New York banking houses of Brown Brothers
                                &amp; Co. and J. W. Seligman and Co.</note> One of these plans, for
                            example, would appear to render any reduction of Nicaraguan customs
                            rates impossible.</p>

                        <p>16. Your February 6, 3 p.m. While Department does not fully understand
                            statement that “simple statement of adherence to the treaty” will obtain
                            for us equal rights, it assumes that Nicaraguan Government is suggesting
                            the conclusion of a preferential tariff arrangement like that between
                            Nicaragua and France. You may point out that it is not the policy of
                            this Government to enter into such arrangement. This Government’s
                            present policy is one of equality of treatment to all countries which do
                            not discriminate against American commerce. The Tariff Act of 1922

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: At the present time the
                            Government of Nicaragua, under a treaty with France, accords to certain
                            specified French products a reduction in import duties amounting to
                            twenty-five per centum of the regularly imposed duties. This reduction
                            is not extended to similar goods from the United States and would
                            appear, consequently, to constitute a discrimination within the meaning
                            of Section 317 of the Tariff Act of 1922, which authorizes the
                            President, under specified conditions, to levy additional duties upon
                            products imported into the United States from countries which
                            discriminate against American commerce in favor of the commerce of any
                            other country.</p>
                        <p>It appears preferable for the United States, rather than to consider the
                            imposition of additional import duties on merchandise from Nicaragua, to
                            negotiate an arrangement with a view to eliminating the discriminations
                            by mutual consent. Arrangements of this sort providing for unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment, a policy which was approved by President
                            Harding in a letter which he addressed <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0607"/>to me under date of February 27, 1923,<note n="21" xml:id="d447fn21">Not printed.</note> were effected by exchanges of
                            notes with Brazil, on October 18, 1923,<note n="22" xml:id="d447fn22"><ref target="frus1923v01#pg_461"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            29, 1923.<note n="23" xml:id="d447fn23"><ref target="frus1923v01#pg_873"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 873</ref>.</note>
                            Accordingly, with a view to avoiding the continuance of the existing
                            discriminations against American commerce on the part of Nicaragua, it
                            is proposed to enter into an arrangement with that Government, in the
                            form of an exchange of notes, by which Nicaragua and the United States
                            would respectively undertake not to discriminate against the goods of
                            the other country. Such an arrangement, while removing the
                            discrimination against American products, would not involve the United
                            States in an obligation to do anything that would not be done as a
                            matter of course under existing legislation, once the discrimination
                            against American goods is removed. The proposed arrangement would be
                            terminable in case either party should find itself in a position where,
                            because of change in legislation, it could not continue to be bound by
                            its commitments.</p>
                        <p>I have ascertained that the Nicaraguan Government is disposed to enter
                            into an arrangement of this character, but before proposing to that
                            Government the text of notes to be exchanged I desire to learn whether
                            this course of action meets with your approval.</p>

                            Honduras or Salvador”.</p>
                        <p>“That, similarly, no higher or other duties or charges shall be imposed
                            in either of the two countries on the exportation of any articles to the
                            other than are payable on the exportation of the like articles to any
                            foreign country with the exception of those mentioned above”.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that, with the above-mentioned exceptions every
                            concession with respect to any duty affecting commerce now accorded or
                            that hereafter may be accorded by the United States or by Nicaragua by
                            Law, Proclamation, Decree or Commercial Treaty or Agreement to the
                            products of any third country will become immediately applicable without

                            United States respectively.</p>
                        <p>It is, however, the purpose of the United States and Nicaragua and it is
                            herein expressly declared that the provisions of this arrangement shall
                            not be construed to affect the right of the United States and Nicaragua
                            to impose on such terms as they may see fit prohibitions or restrictions
                            of a sanitary character designed to protect human, animal or plant life
                            or regulations for the enforcement of police or revenue laws.</p>
                        <p>The present arrangement may be terminated by either party on thirty days
                            notice. In the event, however, that either the United States or
                            Nicaragua shall be prevented by legislative action from giving full
                            effect to the provisions of this arrangement, it shall automatically <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0610"/>lapse. I shall be glad to have

                            Excellency my understanding of the views developed in the conversations
                            recently had in Managua on behalf of the Governments of Nicaragua and
                            the United States, with reference to the treatment which Nicaragua shall
                            accord to the commerce of the United States and which the United States
                            shall accord to the commerce of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>These conversations have demonstrated mutual understanding between the
                            two Governments, which is that in respect to import, export and other
                            duties and charges affecting commerce Nicaragua will accord to the
                            United States and the United States will accord to Nicaragua
                            unconditional most favored nation treatment with, however, the following
                            exceptions: <list>

                        <p>The true meaning and effect of this engagement is “that no higher tariff

                        <p>It is understood that with the above mentioned exceptions every

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: On January 7th, 1924,
                            there appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Rochester Herald</hi>, (state of
                            New York) a correspondence from the national capital dated January 6,
                            saying among other things that the Norwegian Polar explorer Roald
                            Amundsen had agreed that the United States might claim all the land he
                            might find on the expedition he is planning to make by aeroplanes to the
                            North Polar regions. This became known, it is stated in said
                            correspondence, through the presence of a letter in the Navy
                            Department’s files, signed by Mr. H. H. Hammer, the American
                            representative of Mr. Amundsen. It is further stated in said
                            correspondence that Mr. Hammer signed a communication saying that the
                            United States was welcome to any discoveries. The Secretary of the Navy,
                            Mr. Denby, it is further stated in the correspondence, acknowledged this
                            offer with thanks and agreed to lend to the expedition Lieutenant Ralph
                            Eugene Davison.</p>
                        <p>Upon learning about the correspondence published by the <hi rend="italic">Rochester Herald</hi>, Mr. Roald Amundsen has informed the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs at Christiania that he has in no way given his
                            consent to any annexation of land for the benefit of the United States.
                            I have been instructed by my Government to bring Mr. Amundsen’s
                            statement to the attention of the Government of the United States under
                            reference to said press communication, of which a photostat copy is

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to your note of February
                            25, 1924, concerning an alleged agreement of Roald Amundsen to allow the
                            United States to claim all lands he might discover on his projected
                            aeroplane expedition to the North Polar regions, I beg to inform you
                            that I am in receipt of a communication from the Acting Secretary of the
                            Navy stating that a search of the files of the Navy Department shows
                            that the article which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Rochester
                                Herald</hi> was incorrect in its statement that any offer made by
                            Mr. Hammer was acknowledged by the Secretary of the Navy. The basis for
                            the rumor contained in the clipping from the <hi rend="italic">Rochester
                                Herald</hi> of January 7, 1924, is, however, to be found in a signed
                            statement, dated October 26, 1923, made by H. H. Hammer, the American
                            representative of Captain Amundsen, to Captain Johnson, Assistant Chief
                            of the Bureau of Aeronautics, of the Navy Department, setting forth the
                            plans for the transpolar flight.</p>
                        <p>In the concluding sentence Mr. Hammer states “although Captain Amundsen
                            is Norwegian, he would not lay claim to any new lands discovered on
                            behalf of his government, and an American officer could if so desired
                            claim it for his government.” The Navy Department did not reply to this
                            offer in any manner. Furthermore, the Acting Secretary of the Navy
                            states that while Lieutenant Davison was granted permission to volunteer
                            to accompany the expedition, “The Navy has no official connection with
                            the expedition and no control over the plans made by Captain Amundsen to
                            carry it forward.”</p>
                        <p>In the penultimate paragraph of your letter you state that., in order to
                            avoid any misunderstanding, you would add that possession of all the
                            land which Mr. Amundsen may discover will, of course, be taken in the
                            name of His Majesty, the King of Norway. In my opinion rights similar to
                            those which in earlier centuries were based upon the acts of a
                            discoverer, followed by occupation or settlement consummated at long and
                            uncertain periods thereafter, are not capable of being acquired at the
                            present time. Today, if an explorer is able to ascertain the existence
                            of lands still unknown to civilization, his act of so-called discovery,
                            coupled with a formal taking of possession, would have no significance,
                            save as he might herald the advent of the settler; and where for
                            climatic or other reasons actual settlement would be an impossibility,
                            as in the case of the Polar regions, such conduct on his part would
                            afford frail support for a reasonable claim of sovereignty. I am
                            therefore compelled to state, without now adverting to other
                            considerations, that this Government cannot admit that such taking of
                            possession as a discoverer by Mr. Amundsen <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0614"/>of areas explored by him could establish the basis of
                            rights of sovereignty in the Polar regions, to which, it is understood,
                            he is about to depart.</p>

                            Amundsen would not lay claim to any new lands discovered on behalf of
                            the Norwegian Government, and that an American officer could claim it
                            for the American Government, which statement Mr. Hammer had made without

                            order to provide ample time for the conclusion of the treaty
                            negotiations, the War Department is today instructing the Canal
                            authorities to continue as heretofore, for a period of one month the <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0617"/>rules and practices of the
                            Canal administration in the matter of commercial operations in the Canal
                            Zone. This will mean that: (1). The sale of goods imported into the
                            Canal Zone by the Government of the United States shall be limited by it
                            to the officers, employees, workmen and laborers in the service and
                            employ of the United States and the Panama Railroad Company, and to
                            contractors operating in the Canal Zone and their employees, workmen and
                            laborers and the families of all such persons. The United States would
                            continue to make sales to ships as heretofore. (2). The Canal
                            authorities will continue to cooperate in all proper ways with the
                            Republic of Panama to prohibit smuggling into the Republic of goods
                            purchased in the commissaries. (3). The Canal authorities will continue
                            to extend to private merchants residing in the Republic of Panama the
                            facilities for making sales to vessels transiting the Canal which they
                            now enjoy. (4). The Government of the United States will continue to
                            provide at a reasonable charge ships trading between ports of the
                            Pacific coast and the city of Panama with docking facilities for the
                            loading and unloading of merchandise in the port of Balboa whenever
                            merchandise are consigned to the city of Panama or are to be shipped
                            therefrom; same facilities to continue to be enjoyed by passengers bound
                            for and departing from the city of Panama from or for ports of the
                            Pacific coast. (5). With the exception of cable companies, oil, shipping
                            and other concerns having a direct connection with the construction,
                            operation, maintenance, sanitation and protection of the Canal no
                            private business enterprise shall be permitted by the United States to
                            be established, in addition to those already established in the Canal
                            Zone. (6). With the exception of the guests of the Tivoli and Washington
                            Hotels no person who is not an officer, employee, workman or laborer of
                            the United States, the Panama Canal, the Panama Railroad Company or a
                            contractor operating in the Canal Zone or his employees, workmen and

                        <p>Greatly disturbed by the reports sent by the Panaman Commissioners who
                            are negotiating in Washington the new treaty to take the place of the
                            Taft Agreement and earnestly desiring the negotiations to yield
                            satisfactory results, I wish to appeal to Your Excellency’s sense of
                            justice and equity and to ask for your personal intervention so as to
                            prevent a failure of the negotiations. Panama has declared herself
                            willing to agree to all requests of the United States including the
                            transfer of jurisdiction over a large part of the city of Colon which
                            for Panama means the distressing sacrifice of witnessing a further
                            mutilation of her territory in the principal port of the Republic. All
                            that Panama asks is that the new treaty achieving the ends by which it
                            is inspired, shall insure stability for Panama in her economic life by
                            permanently establishing the proposition that the status of the Canal
                            Zone cannot affect the commerce of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>Panama asks that the policy outlined by President Theodore Roosevelt in
                            1904 and afterwards confirmed by his successor and various Secretaries
                            of State be given expression in the new treaty so that she may find
                            therein the guarantee of the security that is most wanting, for if the
                            essential stipulations are not laid down as permanent in the same terms
                            as are used in the Hay–Bunau Varilla Treaty,<note n="12" xml:id="d459fn12"><ref target="frus1904#pg_543"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1904, p. 543</ref>.</note> she will
                            ever lie under the threat of commercial, industrial and physical ruin
                            brought on by the erection of a competing commercial colony in the Canal
                            Zone. As long as that menace exists the people of Panama will always
                            live in fear of their economic development being curtailed or
                            crippled.</p>
                        <p>In 1903 Panama gave the United States every power and privilege needed to
                            insure the construction of the inter-oceanic canal and did so in the
                            hope that in it she would find her economic redemption. The United
                            States has built and operated the Canal with full success and we have
                            declared, for its protection, our will to bind ourselves as allies
                            without restriction both in peace and in war. By the treaty of 1903
                            Panama ceded and the United States acquired the use, occupation and
                            control of the Canal Zone for the construction, maintenance, operation,
                            sanitation and protection of the Canal. We ask that that strip of land
                            be ever used for those lofty ends and never be made a cause of
                            instability and menace of ruin to the very nation that ceded it. Present
                            difficulties are due to insistence by the American Commissioners <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0619"/>in stipulating a fifteen-year
                            period for the only clauses that are vital to Panama, despite the fact
                            that the Taft Agreement endured twenty years and that the joint
                            resolution of Congress, no. 259 of February 6, 1923,<note n="13" xml:id="d459fn13"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_677"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p.
                                    677</ref>.</note> authorized the abrogation of that agreement
                            which was styled transitory and was to be superseded by a permanent one,
                            and also despite the fact that each and every one of the concessions
                            made by Panama in the draft of the treaty now under consideration are in
                            perpetuity as must also be the concessions asked by Panama for the
                            stability of her economic independence. Equity prescribes that there
                            should be reciprocity and mutual concessions in the terms of the new
                            treaty and I trust that through Your Excellency’s benevolent
                            intervention all the clauses agreed on will be perpetual so that each
                            one of the two parties shall be equally favored by its benefits.</p>

                        <p>49. You will deliver the following to President Porras: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Your Excellency’s telegram to the President dated the 9th
                                    instant regarding the treaty negotiations now going on in
                                    Washington has been received and carefully considered and
                                    special study has been given to your desire that the article of
                                    the treaty granting commercial privileges to Panama be made in
                                    perpetuity and not for a period of fifteen years. I beg to
                                    recall to you the statement made by the Secretary of State in
                                    his note of October 15, 1923,<note n="14" xml:id="d460fn14"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_648"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 648</ref>.</note> to the Panaman
                                    Minister in Washington that it was manifest that before entering
                                    upon the vast extent of the enterprise undertaken by this
                                    Government in providing for the construction, operation and
                                    protection of the Panama Canal this Government had to be sure
                                    that it obtained adequate rights in the Zone and that the
                                    protection of the Canal in the future was appropriately secured.
                                    For this purpose the Canal Treaty of 1903 was made. To meet
                                    certain administrative exigencies during the period of the
                                    construction of the Canal, the administrative arrangement known
                                    as the Taft Agreement was effected. This arrangement, however,
                                    was of a temporary nature in order to serve more conveniently
                                    the situation then existing and it was expressly declared that
                                    in no wise did it affect the rights of either party to the
                                    Treaty of 1903. That Treaty forms and must continue to form the
                                    basis of the relations between the United States and Panama and
                                    provides the safeguards for the future which were deemed by this
                                    Government to be of controlling importance in making the
                                    decision to construct the Canal.</p>
                                <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0620"/>
                                <p>Thus while it was possible to grant certain concessions to Panama
                                    in the Taft Agreement, through the non-exercise of certain of
                                    our rights under the Treaty of 1903 because that Agreement was a
                                    temporary one and was expressly stated not to be a delimitation,
                                    definition, restriction or restrictive construction of the
                                    rights of either party under the Treaty, it is manifestly
                                    impossible for the United States to make such concessions in
                                    perpetuity when its eventual needs in the future cannot now
                                    clearly be foreseen.</p>
                                <p>Your Excellency asks that the policy outlined by President
                                    Roosevelt in 1904 be given expression in the new treaty. You
                                    doubtless refer to the statement in a letter from President
                                    Roosevelt to Mr. Taft, dated October 19, 1904, in which he
                                    stated ‘we do not intend in the least to establish an
                                    independent colony in the center of the State of Panama or to
                                    exercise governmental functions broader than is necessary to
                                    enable us to build, maintain and operate the Canal, in
                                    accordance with the rights given us by the Treaty.’ In making
                                    this statement President Roosevelt undoubtedly gave expression
                                    to the policy of this Government, a policy to which it has
                                    closely adhered, but the statement will not admit of such a
                                    broad construction as to imply any intention on President
                                    Roosevelt’s part to limit the rights definitely accorded to this
                                    Government by the Treaty of 1903.</p>
                                <p>The policy outlined by President Roosevelt has, as stated above,
                                    been closely adhered to but the American Government must
                                    preserve its complete freedom of action for the future to avail
                                    itself should necessity therefor arise of the rights, power and
                                    authority granted to the United States by the Treaty of 1903.
                                    This Government is perfectly willing to grant to the Panaman
                                    Government privileges of the character described in the proposed
                                    treaty for as long a period as can be safely foreseen and for
                                    this reason these privileges have been given for a term of
                                    fifteen years with a provision that they will be continued
                                    thereafter for periods of five years unless denounced one year
                                    in advance of the termination of any such period. This is in
                                    accordance with the traditional policy of the United States
                                    Government to deal not only fairly and justly but generously
                                    with the Republic of Panama and I hope you will agree with me
                                    that the interests of Panama are fully protected and provided
                                    for in the proposed treaty.</p>
                                <p>The above question and the question of the transfer of
                                    jurisdiction over a part of the city of Colon are distinct and
                                    separate. In this connection I desire to point out that title to
                                    all the land comprised in the area in question is now vested in
                                    the Panama Railway Company and at the expiration of that
                                    Company’s concession the reversionary rights to those lands are
                                    held by the United States by virtue of the provisions of the
                                    Treaty of 1903. It is eminently reasonable that the United
                                    States should desire jurisdiction, especially police
                                    jurisdiction, over the areas used in connection with the Canal
                                    operation and inhabited by officers and employees of this
                                    Government in the operation of the Canal. This will avoid
                                    possibilities of friction.</p>
                                <p>Your Excellency further states that each and every one of the
                                    concessions made by Panama in the draft of the treaty now under
                                    consideration are perpetual. I desire to point out to Your
                                    Excellency that a number of concessions granted by the United
                                    States to <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0621"/>Panama in the

                                    instance, the appraisement of additional private lands acquired
                                    by the United States in the future to be based upon their value
                                    at the time they are acquired rather than at their value prior
                                    to the conclusion of the Treaty of 1903; the agreement of the
                                    United States to construct roads to the value of approximately
                                    $2,000,000 in the territory of Panama; to supply free of charge
                                    to Panama the necessary space for the establishment of custom
                                    houses in Canal Zone ports; free trade established between
                                    Panama and the Zone; concession regarding transportation of
                                    alcoholic liquors across the Zone; the making of Panaman
                                    currency legal tender in the Zone, et cetera. The only
                                    privileges granted to Panama for a term of years rather than in
                                    perpetuity are those in regard to certain commercial privileges
                                    and the reasons why they cannot be given in perpetuity are
                                    explained above.</p>
                                <p>I am confident that Your Excellency, upon further consideration
                                    of the matter, will perceive the very generous spirit in which
                                    the negotiations have been undertaken by the United States and
                                    will fully appreciate the desire and determination of this
                                    Government to deal justly and liberally with the Panaman
                                    Government in all matters. Joseph C. Grew, Acting Secretary of
                                    State.”</p>

                            Panaman Minister to the United States, who, by reason of the absence of

                            period from March 17 to August 6 last. The discussions were restricted
                            for the most part to the points presented for consideration by the

                            extent upon certain preliminary proposals advanced by Dr. Alfaro at a
                            series of informal conferences which took place in February and early in
                            March. The major part of the questions discussed offered no serious
                            difficulties to an agreement and, after formal exchanges of views by the
                            two commissions, were satisfactorily disposed of. The results of these
                            deliberations are embodied in a tentative draft of the proposed treaty,
                            a copy of which is transmitted with this instruction for your strictly
                            confidential information only.<note n="16" xml:id="d461fn18">Not
                                printed.</note> This draft was prepared by the American Commission
                            and modified in accordance with agreements reached at subsequent
                            meetings with the Panaman Commission. It should be pointed out, however,
                            that Articles II and IV as incorporated in the draft represent only
                            partial agreements respecting their subject matter, and the inability of
                            the negotiators to arrive at a mutually satisfactory settlement on these
                            points, particularly the latter one, is responsible for the delay in
                            concluding the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Article II relates to the proposal of the American Commission that Panama
                            grant to the United States the use, occupation and control of a portion
                            of the city of Colon required by this Government for the more efficient
                            administration of the Panama Canal. The American Commissioners’ original
                            proposal envisaged the cession of an area somewhat larger than that
                            described in the draft under reference and offered as compensation
                            therefor to remit the debt owed by Panama to the United States for the
                            construction of water works, sewers et cetera, in Colon. A counter
                            proposal of the Panaman Commission provided for the surrender by the
                            United States to Panama of all property owned by the Panama Railroad
                            Company in Panama and Colon, not employed for Canal purposes, in return
                            for the proposed cession of land in Colon. This was rejected by the
                            American Commission and the suggested pecuniary compensation was
                            increased by an offer to repay to Panama the sums already paid by the
                            latter on account of the original indebtedness for water works and sewer
                            construction, thus making a total of about $1,250,000. The Panaman
                            Commissioners declined to accede to this proposition and appeared, as
                            was revealed by subsequent events, to entertain the intention of
                            bargaining its acceptance of this proposal against the acceptance by the
                            American Commission of Panama’s contention that the provision of
                            proposed Article IV, in which the United States agrees to waive the
                            exercise of certain <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0623"/>commercial
                            privileges in the Canal Zone, be made of permanent effect. As the
                            American Commission was unwilling to go beyond its proposals as embodied
                            in Article IV of the attached draft, an effort was made to reach a
                            solution of the difficulty by decreasing the area sought in Colon to the
                            absolute minimum consistent with the needs of the Panama Canal and by
                            offering to cede a small portion of Cristobal abutting on Boca Chica to
                            Panama. These last proposals are those contained in the draft and, as
                            stated above, have not been accepted by the Panaman Commission.</p>
                        <p>Article IV of the draft relates to the temporary non-exercise by the
                            United States of certain commercial rights in the Canal Zone and grants
                            certain rights therein to the Republic of Panama. While the Panaman
                            Commission appeared to be willing to accept the numbered sections which
                            it contains, it declined to accede to the temporary feature of the
                            article embodied in the final paragraph, and originally proposed, as an
                            alternative, a limitation thereof of not less than thirty years. The
                            American Commission, which had at first proposed a limitation of ten
                            years after which the article would continue in force indefinitely
                            unless denounced by either party on six months’ notice, found itself
                            unable to accept this suggestion and proposed, as a compromise, that the
                            period be extended to fifteen years, the article to remain in effect
                            thereafter for successive periods of five years, unless denounced one
                            year prior to the expiration of any such period. The matter remained in
                            abeyance during the consideration of other subjects, and when
                            conversations thereanent were resumed the Panaman Commission, as already
                            stated, made the acceptance of their views that the article be of
                            permanent effect a condition for their acquiescence in the American
                            Commission’s proposals regarding the cession of land in Colon.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the Chairman of the Panaman Commission sought and
                            obtained an audience with the President, in which he presented the views
                            of his government regarding this question. The President reiterated the
                            assurances previously given by the Secretary of State that this
                            Government is animated by the friendliest feelings toward Panama, that
                            it is not its desire to do anything that would harm Panama or its
                            commercial prosperity, and that while the United States did not intend
                            as a matter of policy to set up a commercial colony in the Canal Zone it
                            could not give up its rights under the Treaty of 1903, but at most would
                            agree to a non-exercise of certain of those rights for so long a period
                            as it can safely foresee what its requirements may be. Similar
                            assurances were conveyed to the President of Panama in the Department’s
                            telegram of July 12, 2 p.m., to your legation.</p>
                        <p>From certain remarks made by Dr. Alfaro to officers of the Department as
                            well as from several of your reports on the situation in <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0624"/>Panama, the Department gained the
                            impression that the Government of Panama might be entertaining the
                            opinion that that country might lose nothing by not entering into the
                            projected treaty, in the hope and expectation that, as a result of the
                            assurances above referred to, no competing commercial establishments
                            would be permitted in the Canal Zone which might interfere with the
                            monopoly that would otherwise be enjoyed by the merchants of Panama.</p>
                        <p>The Department considered that, while the conclusion of the treaty under
                            negotiation might be of greater advantage to Panama than to the United
                            States, the substantial progress already recorded in the work of the
                            Commissions afforded satisfactory solutions of the majority of the
                            problems confronting the two Governments. The Department, therefore,
                            felt that it would be unfortunate should a misapprehension of the intent
                            of the President’s remarks to Dr. Alfaro lead the Panaman Government to
                            terminate the negotiations. Accordingly, the matter was submitted to the
                            President who authorized the following statement to be communicated
                            orally to the Panaman Minister on August 4, 1924: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The expression which the President gave in his conversations
                                    with Señor Alfaro and Señor Chiari, of the policy of this
                                    Government not to set up a commercial colony in the Canal Zone
                                    will of course not admit of such a broad construction as to
                                    imply any intention on the President’s part to limit the rights
                                    definitely accorded to the United States Government by the
                                    Treaty of 1903. Señor Alfaro had informed this Government that
                                    in entering upon negotiations for a new agreement after the
                                    abrogation of the Taft Agreement, Panama did not intend to
                                    assume the attitude of a nation whose interests were
                                    antagonistic to the United States, but desired to deal with the
                                    United States openly and frankly as a staunch friend. This
                                    Government has always been animated by like feelings and the
                                    President gave expression to this feeling in his statement of
                                    policy which was made not only in view of the friendly spirit
                                    expressed by the Panaman Minister but also in the belief that
                                    negotiations carried on in that spirit would eventuate in the
                                    conclusion of an agreement to settle difficulties which had
                                    arisen in the relations between the two Governments. Should a
                                    treaty not be concluded, the United States—while it will
                                    continue to be animated by the friendliest feelings toward
                                    Panama, and will continue as in the past to deal not only in a
                                    friendly but also in a generous manner with Panama—must reserve
                                    the right to act in such circumstances in accordance with the
                                    full rights granted to it by the Treaty of 1903. This frank
                                    statement is inspired through friendship for Panama and in order
                                    that there may be no misunderstanding regarding the scope of the
                                    President’s statement to the Panaman Minister.”</p>

                        <p>To this the Minister replied that he fully understood the situation; that
                            the President’s friendly expression was of course not a limitation of
                            the Treaty and that should there be no treaty the relations would <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0625"/>be on the basis of the Treaty
                            of 1903. It was for this reason that his Government desired the
                            commercial clause in the treaty to be perpetual.</p>
                        <p>Prior to his departure on leave of absence, Dr. Alfaro informed the
                            Department that he believed it to be the desire of his Government that
                            the treaty negotiations should remain in abeyance until his return to
                            Washington in October next.</p>

                                printed.</note> and 217 of August 22, regarding treaty negotiations.
                            Had purely informal conversation with President and Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs. Both understood that I had no instructions from Department.
                            President expressed desire to finish treaty and said that he would sign
                            treaty and get it ratified before he went out of office on October 1 if
                            questions of difference could be resolved in the following manner: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That waterworks and sewer construction debts be permitted to
                                    pend, but that about $1,250,000 be spent by United States in
                                    building road from Panama to Colon and thence to Porto Bello. In
                                    case the amount proved insufficient Panama would contribute
                                    balance. The conditions governing the maintenance and use of the
                                    road would be the same as those stipulated in article 3 of the
                                    draft treaty. I was recently informed by the commanding general
                                    of the Canal Zone that he considers it very desirable to build a
                                    road from Panama to Colon.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That the United States cede to Panama in addition to the small
                                    part of Cristobal abutting on Boca Chica an unoccupied strip of
                                    land about 400 meters long located near the club in Colon which
                                    is now owned by the Panama Railroad Company. This land is to be
                                    used entirely for docking purposes in connection with the
                                    coastwise trade. It is my opinion that the President will not
                                    insist upon this proposal.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>That article 4, last paragraph, of draft treaty stipulate 30
                                    years instead of 15. Dr. Morales was of the impression that the
                                    Department never declined to accept the 30–year limit. In case
                                    Department is opposed to 30-year term perhaps a compromise could
                                    be made by Department considering term of 22 to 25 years, and
                                    this compromise would have greater chance of success if
                                    subsequent terms were six or seven years instead of five
                                    years.</item>

                        <p>There seems to be little doubt that present Assembly would ratify treaty
                            immediately. Both the Assembly and its committee on foreign relations
                            would be favorably disposed. There will probably be only a short
                            session. It is still uncertain whether Chiari will agree to accept
                            treaty in its present form. The President appears enthusiastic over
                            finishing the treaty and now seems to be the time to close the
                            negotiations. If the Department should be of the opinion that an
                            agreement can be reached along the line of the above-mentioned points or
                            of any or all of them, I shall be pleased to convey Department’s views
                            to the President in a purely informal way and without prejudice to the
                            negotiations which the two commissions are conducting.</p>
                        <p>The President has not informed Alfaro of his latest views as to signing
                            of the treaty, for reasons which were reported in my telegram no. 80 of
                            September 2.<note n="18" xml:id="d462fn18">“The friction which arose

                        <p>86. Legation’s number 82, September 8. Inasmuch as Department does not
                            seem interested in President’s recent proposals in the matter of the
                            proposed treaty, I have purposely avoided having any more informal
                            conversations with regard to the treaty. The Department may rest assured
                            that the formal negotiations have in no way been prejudiced.
                            Nevertheless, this morning Mr. Morales notified me informally that
                            President Porras would withdraw his request for the 400-meter water
                            frontage in Colon, included in item 2 of my cable, and that the clause
                            in the draft treaty which refers to a transfer of jurisdiction of a
                            portion of Colon to the United States would be acceptable with the
                            following provisos: <list>

                        <p>64. Your 82 and 86, September 8, 4 p.m., and September 15, 4 p.m. You may
                            tell the President informally in reply to his suggestions made to you as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. This Government would be willing to have the debt for water works and
                            sewer construction liquidated in accordance with the arrangement now in
                            force, and it will therefore not be mentioned in the treaty. This
                            Government would be willing to include in the treaty a stipulation that,
                            as compensation for the land in Colon jurisdiction of which is to be
                            given to the United States, the United States would expend a sum not
                            exceeding $1,250,000. for the construction of a road from Panama to
                            Colon and Porto Bello on condition that the roads shall be constructed
                            by the Panama Canal and construction shall be undertaken only after
                            Panama has made satisfactory financial provision for furnishing the cost
                            above the $1,250,000. provided by this Government, and after the latter
                            sum has been appropriated by the Congress of the United States.</p>
                        <p>For your own information. Should Panama not be willing to make the above
                            financial arrangement this Government would consider an agreement by
                            which the cost of the construction as it progresses would be prorated
                            between the two Governments each Government paying a share in relative
                            proportion to its share of the total cost of the project as determined
                            by the engineers’ estimate on the understanding that the total
                            contribution by the United States will not exceed one million and a
                            quarter dollars.</p>
                        <p>It is not clear from the Panaman proposal what line the proposed road
                            will follow. The Department presumes that advantage will be taken of the
                            road which the Canal Government proposes to construct from Balboa to
                            Alhajuela.</p>
                        <p>2. While this Government does not now foresee the necessity for asking
                            for any further cession of the city of Colon to the United States, it
                            cannot bind itself in a treaty never to do so since future <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0628"/>exigencies cannot be foreseen at this
                            time. You may point out to the President that this request on his part
                            seems unusual and unnecessary in view of the fact that Panama is in no
                            wise obligated to grant any further request for transfers of
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>3. This Government is unable to accept the Panaman proposal that the
                            dividing line between the Zone and Colon follow the course of the
                            streets and that the latter remain under Panaman jurisdiction. This
                            Government would, however, consent to establishing the boundary line
                            along the middle of the streets. You may point out to President Porras,
                            however, that under such an arrangement Panama would be obliged to
                            construct and maintain one half of the street paving which would not be
                            the case if the boundary proposed by the United States were followed.
                            The President of course understands that should the boundary be changed
                            to follow the center of the streets a delay must necessarily occur while
                            the new metes and bounds are surveyed and prepared.</p>
                        <p>4. The question of the statue of Christopher Columbus would not appear to
                            be a matter to be covered by the treaty. However, should the treaty be
                            negotiated this Government would have no objection to informing the
                            Panaman Government by note that it can do what it pleases with this
                            statue.</p>
                        <p>5. The United States would be willing to make proper allowance to Panama
                            for the present value of improvements in the area to be ceded to the
                            United States which were actually paid for by Panama. A number of these
                            improvements were made by the Canal Zone and Panama contributed nothing
                            to their cost. In such case of course no allowance can be made to
                            Panama. The present value of the improvements for which compensation is
                            to be made would be determined by the Joint Commission provided in
                            Article I of the draft treaty.</p>
                        <p>6. The United States would consent to a cession of a small water area at
                            the head of Boca Chica, covering the frontage involved in the recession
                            provided for in the draft treaty. The line would be approximately as
                            follows: From the intersection of the receded area and the Canal Zone in
                            a straight direction to a point in about the middle of the Bay thence
                            east to a point in the entrance of the Bay and thence north to land. The
                            exact description of the water area ceded will be drawn up by the Canal
                            authorities. The United States will also make full reservation regarding
                            cables and cable landings already in existence or that may be required
                            in the future.</p>
                        <p>7. In a desire to meet President Porras’ urgent request for a conclusion
                            of the treaty before October 1, this Government would be willing to
                            consent to a modification of the last paragraph of Article IV of the
                            draft treaty so that it shall provide that the Article shall <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0629"/>continue in force for twenty years from
                            ratification of the treaty and thereafter for succeeding periods of
                            seven years each.</p>
                        <p>You will of course make these proposals to the President orally and not
                            in writing. You will also make it absolutely clear to the President that
                            these very considerable concessions on the part of the American
                            Government are made in a desire to meet the President’s wish that the
                            treaty be concluded before October 1, and that they are made purely on
                            the understanding that the treaty will be concluded and ratified by
                            Panama prior to October 1, and that should this not occur for any reason
                            whatsoever these concessions will be considered as withdrawn and the
                            United States will stand upon the proposals made in the treaty
                            negotiations in Washington. Cable results of your conference.</p>

                        <p>91. Your 64 September 18, 5 p.m. The President informed me this morning
                            that he agrees to the proposals contained in the Department’s
                            above-mentioned telegram. In regard to paragraph 1 of the Department’s
                            telegram, the alternative financial arrangement of prorating the cost of
                            roads as construction progressed was unnecessary and therefore not
                            mentioned by me. The President is inclined to leave the direction of the
                            road to the engineers and sees no objection to using any road now built
                            or contemplated which would be practicable.</p>
                        <p>The matter mentioned in paragraph 2 of the Department’s telegram is no
                            longer insisted upon.</p>
                        <p>As to paragraph 3 of the Department’s telegram, the President desires the
                            boundary line to be established along the middle of the streets; the
                            construction and maintenance of one half the street paving is
                            satisfactory. The Panaman engineers will be ready Monday morning to
                            cooperate in any way with the Zone authorities in surveying and
                            preparing the new metes and bounds.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s proposals in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of its
                            above-mentioned telegram are accepted.</p>
                        <p>Concerning paragraph 7 of the Department’s telegram the 20-year period
                            and subsequent 7-year periods are acceptable provided the United States
                            will give two instead of one year’s notice of denouncement or abrogation
                            before the expiration of the 20-year or any of <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0630"/>the 7-year periods. I hope that the
                            Department will find it convenient to meet this request.</p>

                        <p>92. My 91, September 20, 2 p.m. The President has informed me that the
                            new proposals were discussed in detail at yesterday’s conference with
                            the President-elect<note n="19" xml:id="d466fn19">Rodolfo Chiari.</note>
                            which was also attended by the commissioners and that the new President
                            is favorably inclined both to the signing and ratification of the
                            treaty. Mr. Chiari is familiar with all previous negotiations.<note n="20" xml:id="d466fn20"><p>Further changes in the draft were
                                    proposed however by the Panaman negotiators and reported to the
                                    Department by the United States Minister, namely: in art. 2,
                                    that the boundary line be made definitive and perpetual; in art.
                                    4, par. 1, that bonded warehouses be established in the Canal
                                    Zone only by the United States itself and not by private
                                    persons; in art. 6, last par., that the right of the United
                                    States to make use of the cities and harbors of Panama and Colon
                                    for anchorage, loading, etc., be exercised only “in case of
                                    emergency”; in art. 8, that the right of the United States to
                                    enforce quarantine and sanitary regulations be limited to those
                                    which were not of a strictly municipal character. (File nos.

                            conversations should be allowed to be continued after October 1st. I
                            have again informed him and the Commissioners that the Department’s
                            informal proposals are definitely withdrawn and that the negotiation
                            will have to be continued between the two commissions in Washington
                            after agreement had been reached upon the two principal points of

                <p>[The Department of State had hoped to print in the present volume of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> the full record of the case concerning
                    the killing of Vice Consul Robert W. Imbrie at Teheran, Persia, on July 18,
                    1924. However, when certain documents in the case were, in accordance with
                    established practice, submitted to the Iranian Government with a view to
                    obtaining permission for publication, that Government requested that the

                <p>In view of the importance of the Imbrie case from the point of view of
                    international law, the Department considered that it would be undesirable to

                    proper understanding of the case. In the circumstances the Department
                    reluctantly reached the conclusion that it would be best to defer publication
                    until such time as the Iranian Government was in a position to give its consent

                                general counsel of the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey.</note> called
                            on me on January 23rd to take up the Mesopotamian oil question he read
                            me, asking for any comments, correspondence between the Standard Oil
                            Company of New Jersey and a person in the far west who had written to
                            inquire of the Company whether it was true that they had joined with a
                            British Company to exclude another American oil company from Persia. Mr.
                            Wellman said that this was rather a serious accusation and that as they
                            found out that the person making the inquiry was a substantial citizen
                            they thought his letter should be answered.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0634"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wellman then read the reply which the Company had already sent. This
                            reply gave a somewhat full history of the negotiations of the Standard
                            Oil Company of New Jersey with the Persian Government and the
                            Anglo-Persian Oil Company with regard to North Persia, and explained the
                            Company’s cooperation with British interests on the ground of a
                            pre-existing concession granted to Koshtaria and acquired from Koshtaria
                            by the Anglo-Persian Company. Reference was also made to the conferences
                            which the Standard Oil Company’s representatives had had with the
                            Department in December 1921, at which time, according to Mr. Wellman’s
                            letter, the Department had indicated that it favored a policy of
                            cooperation rather than of conflict in Persia. As I recall (Mr. Wellman
                            did not leave a copy), the letter also indicated that the Standard Oil
                            Company proposed to defend their share of the Koshtaria claim acquired
                            from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.</p>
                        <p>After reading me this letter Mr. Wellman said that the Standard Oil
                            Company had felt that it was desirable to make this frank statement,
                            that they naturally planned to protect their interests. Mr. Wellman
                            further indicated that the Standard Oil Company contemplated making the
                            letter public. I told Mr. Wellman that I could not comment in any way
                            upon the letter. It expressed the views of the Standard Oil Company not
                            the views of the Department. I realized that the Company had a right to
                            protect its interests in the way which seemed best to it.</p>
                        <p>(The letter which Mr. Wellman read was of a character to precipitate the
                            controversy between the Standard Oil and the Sinclair with regard to
                            their rights and interests in Persia which will be inevitable in case
                            the Sinclair concession is formally ratified. I gathered the impression
                            from Mr. Wellman that the Standard Oil Company expected the Department
                            to maintain a position of neutrality as between the 50% Standard Oil
                            Company interest in the Koshtaria concession and the prospective 100%
                            Sinclair Oil Company interest in the concession recently signed by the
                            Persian Ministry but not ratified by the Parliament. Mr. Wellman
                            apparently felt that the Department, in case issue should be joined on
                            this point, would favor the settlement of the controversy by an
                            impartial arbitration which would determine the respective merits of the
                            Koshtaria and the possible Sinclair concession. I said that the
                            Department, as far as I knew, had not definitely decided the course it
                            would take in case the contingency to which he referred should arise.
                            There were two possibilities, one that the Department might itself
                            examine the records and claims of the rival American <hi rend="italic">concessionnaires</hi> and decide which had a valid concession and
                            therefore the right to support. On the other hand the Department might
                            feel that the question was one for arbitration outside the
                            Department.)</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wellman as lie was leaving said that Mr. Bedford<note n="3" xml:id="d468fn3">Alfred C. Bedford, chairman of the board of the
                                directors of the standard Oil Co. of New Jersey.</note> had recently
                            expressed the view to him that the Standard Oil Company, by following
                            the line of policy which the Department had favored in Russia and in
                            Persia, had apparently been placed in a disadvantageous position <hi rend="italic">vis à vis</hi> other Companies which were willing to
                            go ahead irrespective of the Department’s general policy. He then
                            referred to the fact that the Standard Oil Company had refused Russian
                            offers similar to those which had been taken up by the Sinclair. Mr.
                            Well-man added that however this might be the Standard had no idea of
                            changing the policy which it was following, namely, of taking into
                            account what they considered to be the policy of this Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your Excellency has doubtless been
                            informed that, in connection with the contract signed in December last
                            by the Persian Government and the representative of the Sinclair
                            Consolidated Oil Corporation in Teheran for the exploitation of
                            petroleum in four of the five northern provinces of Persia, the Standard
                            Oil Company of New Jersey have let it be known in a letter addressed by
                            them to Mr. A. G. Berger on January 18th, referred to by the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of February 4th last, as about to
                            appear in the current number of <hi rend="italic">The Lamp</hi> (a copy
                            of the advance sheets of which is enclosed<note n="4" xml:id="d469fn4">Not printed.</note>) that they hold jointly with the Anglo-Persian
                            Oil Company, Ltd., a British corporation, a one-half interest in the
                            so-called Khoshtharia grants covering approximately three and
                            one-quarter provinces in north Persia, and that they will take the
                            proper steps to protect their rights and to develop a petroleum
                            production.</p>
                        <p>In view of this attitude on the part of the Standard Oil Company of New
                            Jersey, I deemed it advisable to publish, on my own initiative, a letter
                            in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of the 8th instant,
                            reciting briefly the various phases of my Government’s negotiations with
                            the Standard Oil and the Sinclair interests. That letter has, I
                            understand, been brought to Your Excellency’s attention, but
                            nevertheless I enclose herewith a copy<note n="4" xml:id="d469fn9">Not
                                printed.</note> to complete the record.</p>
                        <p>Having kept my Government informed of recent developments, I have just
                            been instructed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to submit the
                            following points for Your Excellency’s consideration.</p>
                        <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0636"/>
                        <p>In the first place, my Government reiterate the sentiments expressed in a
                            memorandum which I had the honour of handing you shortly after my
                            arrival in Washington on September 15, 1921,<note n="5" xml:id="d469fn5">Printed in S. Doc. 97, 68th Cong., 1st sess., p. 87.</note> namely,
                            that the Persian Government and people have always recognized the
                            altruism and impartiality which distinguish the American Government and
                            people. They particularly appreciate the concern of the United States
                            for fair play, for the respect of the independence of the smaller
                            nations and for the maintenance of the economic open door.</p>
                        <p>It was because of their implicit faith in the lofty ideals and trusted
                            friendship of America that my Government, over a year ago, confided the
                            reorganization of their finances to American advisers and have
                            consistently courted the technical and financial cooperation of this
                            country in the industrial and economic development of Persia.</p>
                        <p>In harmony with this desire for America’s friendly cooperation my
                            Government and the Madjless have consistently acted during the
                            negotiations for an oil concession in the five northern provinces of
                            Persia, as the following brief outline of the negotiations will
                            demonstrate.</p>
                        <p>Early in November, 1921, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey were
                            approached by Mr. W. Morgan Shuster, as Fiscal Agent of the Persian
                            Government, with a view to enlisting their interest in the development
                            of the north Persian oil fields. As a result of these negotiations, I
                            was able to submit by cable to my Government a draft agreement for a
                            concession in the five northern provinces of Persia and for a five
                            million dollar loan. Upon the receipt of this agreement, the matter was
                            discussed in the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Public Works of the
                            Madjless. After consideration in the Committee of the Whole, the
                            Madjless passed a resolution approving the granting of a concession for
                            the north Persian oil fields to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey,
                            and laid down certain conditions intended to safeguard the public
                            interest, among which may be mentioned the condition that the Standard
                            Oil Company of New Jersey should not, in any circumstances, assign or
                            transfer this concession or enter into partnership without the approval
                            of the Madjless. This condition was merely the enunciation of the
                            fundamental policy of my Government that the capital employed must be
                            entirely American. The resolution, of which a copy is enclosed,<note n="6" xml:id="d469fn6">Not printed.</note> was communicated to the
                            Standard Oil Company of New Jersey by Mr. Shuster, with a view to
                            ascertaining whether it was prepared, as my Government hoped would be
                            the case, to enter into an agreement in conformity with the conditions
                            laid down therein.</p>
                        <p>Some months of negotiation ensued, during which representatives of the
                            Anglo-Persian Company, Ltd., approached the Standard Oil <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0637"/>Company and informed it of the
                            exclusive rights which the former claimed in the north Persian oil
                            fields under the supposed Khoshtharia concession. Thereupon, in
                            February, 1922, the Standard Oil Company signified a desire to associate
                            itself in the development of the Persian Oil fields on a fifty–fifty
                            basis with the Anglo-Persian Company. Although I repeatedly requested
                            it, I was never able to obtain from the Standard Oil Company a copy of
                            its agreement with the Anglo-Persian Company, or any information as to
                            its scope. Nevertheless, I was certain that an association of this kind
                            would be distasteful to my Government and the Standard Oil Company was
                            so advised by me. That Company, however, was insistent that this was the
                            only plan upon which it would enter into the proposed concession and a
                            new draft agreement was drawn up on this basis in February, 1922, and
                            forwarded to my Government for consideration. This February proposal was
                            rejected because of the association with the Anglo-Persian Company. On
                            account of this association between the Standard and Anglo-Persian
                            Companies and in order to give the Government more latitude in carrying
                            on the negotiations, the Madjless on June 11, 1922, voted an amendment
                            to its previous resolution, empowering the Government to negotiate a
                            petroleum concession in North Persia with any independent and
                            responsible American Company. With these broad powers, my Government
                            extended the scope of its negotiations and sought proposals from not
                            only the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey but from the Sinclair
                            Consolidated Oil Corporation.</p>
                        <p>At the end of June, the Standard Oil Company indicated its willingness to
                            conform to the resolution of the Madjless and to take and operate the
                            concession entirely on its own account without entering into partnership
                            with any other company so far as the carrying out of the concession was
                            concerned. This new attitude of the Standard Oil Company, which, it will
                            be observed, left out of consideration entirely any partnership alliance
                            with the Anglo-Persian Company, was set forth in an initialed memorandum
                            of June 30, 1922, a copy of which is herewith enclosed.<note n="7" xml:id="d469fn7">Not printed.</note> At the same time, my Government
                            was receiving proposals from the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation
                            through its representative in Teheran. Also after the receipt of the
                            June memorandum, my Government sought more definite terms, in conformity
                            therewith, from the Standard Oil Company, and a draft concession was
                            forwarded to Teheran in the following August. With the Standard and the
                            Sinclair proposals in hand, my Government, in view of the great
                            importance of the concession and the vital interests involved, sought
                            the views of the Madjless by laying both proposals before a special
                            committee of that body.</p>

                        <p>After a thorough examination by this Committee and by my Government, the
                            Standard declining to make any substantial modifications in their
                            proposal or to send a representative to Teheran to discuss the matter
                            directly with the Government, both sets of proposals were rejected
                            because they did not seem to safeguard sufficiently the interests of
                            Persia. In view of this, the Madjless deemed it best to pass a law
                            laying down in greater detail the basis of a concession which my
                            Government was authorized to grant to any independent and reputable
                            American concern that might show interest in the matter. The Standard
                            Oil Company of New Jersey did not show any inclination to meet the
                            requirements of the law and made no proposals, but the Sinclair
                            Consolidated Oil Corporation submitted terms following closely the
                            conditions laid down in the Oil Law. The Standard manifesting no further
                            interest in the concession, an agreement was consequently signed last
                            December by the Government and the Sinclair representative in Teheran
                            subject to the ratification of the Madjless, as the Sinclair Company was
                            the only applicant in the field.</p>
                        <p>Now that there is at last a prospect of the northern oil fields of Persia
                            being developed under purely American auspices, the Standard Oil Company
                            of New Jersey advances certain claims on the basis of association with
                            the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Ltd., in the so-called Khoshtharia
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>I need not repeat the arguments laid in detail before Your Excellency in
                            my note of January 3, 1922,<note n="8" xml:id="d469fn8">Printed in S.
                                Doc. 97, 68th Cong., 1st sess., p. 94.</note> which to your judicial
                            mind will, I am sure, carry conviction that these so-called concessions
                            are null and void. If the Standard Oil Company believed it had acquired
                            any valid rights under these alleged concessions by virtue of
                            association with the Anglo-Persian Company, why did it continue for two
                            years to negotiate for a new concession with the Persian Government? The
                            negotiation indicates the doubtful sincerity of the claims now advanced
                            by the Standard Oil Company.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, therefore, but express surprise that a large American
                            corporation should in these circumstances ally itself with a policy
                            known by it to be repugnant to the Persian nation and openly declare
                            that it maintains its so-called rights under the Khoshtharia concessions
                            and that it proposes to enforce them in defiance of the Persian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Standard Oil made the mistake of yielding to the unwarranted
                            contentions of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. They were repeatedly
                            warned by Mr. Shuster and myself of the strong feeling of suspicion
                            inevitably entertained in Teheran, in view of past experiences, as to
                            British motives and aims, and of the decision of the Persian Government
                            to stand on the firm ground of the invalidity of the alleged Khoshtharia
                            concessions. In spite of this warning, the <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0639"/>Standard Oil Company made their proposal of February,
                            1922, to exploit the five northern provinces in association with the
                            Anglo-Persian Oil Company on a fifty-fifty basis.</p>
                        <p>In view of the facts of the case and the known policies of my Government,
                            Your Excellency will appreciate that the announced determination of the
                            Standard Oil Company in association with the Anglo-Persian Company to
                            enforce its rights under concessions which my Government regard as
                            invalid, cannot be carried out within Persian territory with my
                            Government’s approval. Should, however, the Standard Oil Company of New
                            Jersey, as an American concern, seek the assistance of the United States
                            Government with a view to asserting its alleged rights in the North
                            Persia oil fields, I, acting under instructions from my Government, beg
                            you to take into consideration the history of this whole transaction as
                            I have outlined it above:—the association of the Standard Oil Company
                            with a British concern, in which the British Government has a
                            predominant influence,—an association peculiarly distasteful to my
                            Government, my Government’s well-founded view that the concessions, on
                            which these companies base their rights, are null and void, and also the
                            earnest desire of Persia for American aid, free from foreign influences,
                            in the development of her natural resources.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I am instructed to express again the gratitude of the
                            Government and people of Persia for the friendly and valuable assistance
                            already given them by Your Excellency and to formulate the hope that
                            your Government will continue the policy of encouraging unalloyed
                            American enterprise in Persia.</p>

                            I have the honor to advise the Department that in a recent conference
                            Prince Firouz, the Reporter of the Parliamentary Oil Commission,
                            informed me that inasmuch as the representative of the Anglo-Persian Oil
                            Company has interpreted the action of the Commission in substituting
                            Article 29 of the oil bill as passed in June 1924 for Article 25 in the
                            Sinclair contract as additional evidence of Persia’s inability to defend
                            her position with regard to the Sepahsalar concession, the Commission
                            has decided to reconsider its action and to make the article read “the
                            Persian Government declares that no other concession is valid”.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of five points, the Commission has finished its study
                            of the concession and expects to report out the bill by July 20.</p>

                            oil bill not only because a loan to Persia at the present time seems
                            problematical but because it would prolong life of the present Medjliss

                            had approved all principal clauses of oil concession save that providing
                            for loan. He also gave assurances that if Sinclair would indicate
                            readiness to take over concession, the stipulation for a loan could and
                            would be dropped.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Consulate’s telegram No.
                            9 of July 29, 1924 reporting the departure from Teheran of the
                            representative of the Sinclair Exploration Company, I have the honor to
                            inform the Department that, in a conference on September 17 with the
                            Prime Minister immediately after his return from Khorammabad, I advised
                            him of the departure, on September 11, during his absence, of Mr.
                            Addison T. Ruan, representative of Ulen &amp; Company. This together
                            with the departure on July 28 of Mr. Soper, the Sinclair representative,
                            closely subsequent to the killing of Vice Consul Robert W. Imbrie in
                            Teheran would, I remarked, appear to have dealt, at least for the
                            present, a severe blow to the “American economic program” in Persia so
                            assiduously sponsored by the Prime Minister himself <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0643"/>as well as by most Persian patriots. As
                            both the Sinclair and Ulen projects were originally predicated upon the
                            possibility of a Persian loan being floated on the American market, a
                            more fatal blow could hardly have been struck at this program than the
                            destruction of American confidence in Persia inevitably resultant from
                            the killing of the American Vice Consul.</p>
                        <p>Before I could proceed to a discussion of the only asset remaining from
                            the wreckage, the American financial mission, whose existence hangs now
                            by a thread, the Prime Minister launched at once into the question of
                            the oil concession and expressed his deep personal disappointment that,
                            after three years effort, and an expenditure by the Persian Government
                            of more than 300,000 tomans on telegrams alone, and the passage by the
                            Medjliss of all but two of the articles of this concession, the Sinclair
                            company now appeared to have lost interest in the fate of the concession
                            and was willing to let it lapse. Despite repeated efforts on the part of
                            the Persian Government to ascertain the intentions of the company since
                            Mr. Soper’s departure, no answer to its inquiries had been received.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon requested the Prime Minister to inform me exactly of the
                            present prospects for the passage of the oil concession and promised him
                            I would do what was possible under the circumstances to obtain, through
                            the Department, information from the Sinclair company as to its
                            intentions. He then assured me that the concession could and would pass
                            the Medjliss if that body were sure of its acceptance by the Sinclair
                            company, and that he personally would see that the loan clause was
                            eliminated. It was desirable that Persia find money, it was true, but in
                            view of the urgent necessity of resuscitating her economic life, the
                            question of an immediate loan could be disregarded.</p>
                        <p>As the circumstances attending the passage, up to the last important
                            article of this concession, despite America’s disinterest and the
                            bitterest opposition of the British, are so remarkable, the Legation
                            would find it very helpful if the Department were inclined to instruct
                            it as to the best policy to follow in the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Since my arrival in Teheran in April 1922, I have watched closely the
                            evolution of this exceedingly complicated question so that I trust the
                            Department will not take it amiss if I venture to offer the following
                            observations based on my personal acquaintance with the issue from this
                            angle.</p>
                        <p>1. It is unquestionable that the Standard Oil Company could, in November
                            1921, after the decision of the Medjliss to negotiate with that company
                            for the award of the oil concession in the northern provinces, have had
                            it for the asking. This was never done.</p>
                        <p>2. It is equally as unquestionable that, after the alliance between the
                            Standard Oil Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0644"/>and the subsequent incredible offer to
                            the Persian Government to exploit these provinces on a basis of 50–50
                            participation with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Standard Oil
                            Company could have obtained the concession by no means short of a
                            miracle. A most casual knowledge of the state of Persian sentiment
                            (right or wrong) towards the British since the ill-fated Anglo-Persian
                            Agreement, and of Soviet Russian sentiment since the collapse of
                            Britain’s attempt to seize Baku in 1919 should suffice to prove the
                            truth of this statement.</p>
                        <p>3. Any company, American or otherwise, that obtains the concession to
                            exploit these provinces must, of necessity, have made its peace, at
                            least economic, with Soviet Russia. It is obvious from a glance at the
                            geographical lay of these fields that, barring unexpected events in
                            Russia, the Soviets have, and will continue to have, the last say as to
                            the development of these resources in North Persia. The key of these
                            resources is the Caucasus, and that key is in Russia’s possession.</p>
                        <p>4. It is exceedingly unlikely that, even granting the recent Anglo-Soviet
                            Russian reconciliation, such as it is, and the possibility that an
                            agreement will be reached on a mutual policy and plan of action
                            elsewhere, such a cooperation could easily be arrived at with regard to
                            the Asiatic policy of these Powers. Hence, were American economic
                            intervention in North Persia for the moment blocked or even definitely
                            defeated, it is inconceivable that Great Britain will be able to obtain
                            what she may have prevented America from obtaining.</p>
                        <p>The advantage to Britain of such a “negative victory” is, however, by no
                            means to be underestimated. Great Britain’s interest in Persia dates
                            from the seventeenth century, and her policy may be said to be geared to
                            centuries, whereas ours is scarcely geared to years. She can wait.</p>
                        <p>It is furthermore the conviction of the Prime Minister, as of most
                            enlightened Persians, that the policy of the Standard-Anglo-Persian
                            combination in seeking to acquire these fields was purely that of the
                            dog-in-the-manger awaiting a new turn in Russia and an absorption on
                            world markets of a greater oil supply without menacing present
                            prices.</p>
                        <p>5. If American participation in the development of Persia is to be
                            regarded as desirable, the circumstances attend[ing] the competition of
                            these two American companies for the concession may be regarded as
                            unfortunate, and this for the following reason, namelitem:</p>
                        <p>Whereas the British Government would appear to have regarded the Standard
                            Oil Company, by virtue of its alliance with the Anglo-Persian Oil
                            Company, a company in which 50% of the stock is owned by that
                            Government, as entitled to the mobilization of the last ounce of
                            influence available to the British Legation at Teheran in <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0645"/>order to acquire, in the American
                            company’s name, a concession that doubtlessly would have passed
                            eventually into the complete possession of the British shareholders, the
                            American Government, justly, of course, was obliged to regard both of
                            the American companies as equally entitled to the support, or rather to
                            the neutrality, of the American Legation in Teheran. Hence the anomalous
                            situation of one American company competing without the assistance of
                            its Government’s representative against another American company
                            enjoying the fullest protection and support of a foreign Legation. It
                            may therefore be safely stated that, had the American Government been in
                            a position under the circumstances, to have lent its open assistance in
                            the matter, the concession would doubtlessly have been granted two years

                        <p>99. According to reports from Persia appearing in press, the Persian
                            Government has received a telegram from an official of the Sinclair
                            Company accepting North Persian oil concession. It is stated also that
                            the stipulation for a loan is omitted from the contract. Information has
                            not reached the Department that concession in complete form has been
                            confirmed by the Mejliss (Legation’s 123, September 18). Department
                            awaits your report on the actual status of the oil concession and on the
                            correctness of the above press reports. Soper and others of Sinclair
                            Company when calling recently at Department did not express any
                            expectation that an agreement would be reached so soon.</p>

                        <p>153. Referring Legation’s 123, September 18, and Department’s 99, October
                            14. Yesterday I was informed by Dr. Millspaugh that Sinclair Company has
                            in fact accepted concession as reported in papers. But it is still
                            necessary to obtain from Mejliss final confirmation of contract with
                            omission of the provision for a loan.</p>

                        <p>About October 8 I had heard rumors of Sinclair Company’s acceptance, but
                            I did not then think it expedient to attempt to approach the Persian
                            Government in the matter.</p>
                        <p>In opinion of Millspaugh the concession, omitting reference to loan,
                            could and should pass Mejliss.<note n="12" xml:id="d481fn12">A

                        <p>I have the honor to refer to my report of January 2, 1924 (877) entitled
                            “Projected Persian Railways”<note n="13" xml:id="d482fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> wherein I mentioned the expected arrival of Mr.
                            Lawrence Bennett, representing the Henry Ulen Company and Stone &amp;
                            Webster (the two concerns are now in partnership), and discussed the
                            probable connection of his visit with the pending concession for the
                            exploitation of North Persian Oil by the Sinclair Exploration
                            Company.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lawrence Bennett arrived in Teheran on January 17th., and certain
                            developments have since taken place which are of the best possible
                            augury for the harmonious cooperation of American capital in North
                            Persia.</p>
                        <p>The second day following his arrival Mr. Lawrence Bennett called at this
                            office and fully outlined his intentions, requesting that the Consulate
                            assist him to get into touch with Mr. Ralph Soper, representative in
                            Persia of the Sinclair Exploration Company with a view to cooperate
                            financially in Persian affairs. Mr. Lawrence Bennett stated that the
                            sole interest of his concern was in the construction of public works,
                            including railroads, that they had no interest whatever in oil
                            exploitation, and no affiliations with either the <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0647"/>Standard Oil Company or with any
                            foreign interests and that a brief review of the local situation had
                            convinced him of the advisability of cooperation with the Sinclair
                            financially.</p>
                        <p>I was very happy indeed to place him in touch with Mr. Ralph Soper, and
                            had the privilege of assisting at a most interesting interview between
                            the two gentlemen. Mr. Lawrence Bennett briefly advanced the above
                            information regarding his connections, emphasized the fact that his
                            company had no interest whatever in oil and stated that the sole object
                            of his visit was the construction of public works for the Persian
                            Government upon a cost plus basis, the Persian Government to advance the
                            necessary funds for construction purposes. As an incentive, it had been
                            contemplated to arrange for the disposal of a Persian bond issue in the
                            United States through the connections of Ulen Co., and Stone &amp;
                            Webster, the proceeds of this loan to be earmarked for construction
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>A review of the local situation, Mr. Lawrence Bennett frankly concluded,
                            had convinced him that unless his principals cooperated with the
                            Sinclair Company, nothing could be done in this direction. Under the
                            terms of its oil concession approved by the Persian Government and
                            awaiting ratification by the Medjliss, the Sinclair Company had already
                            undertaken to float a loan of ten million dollars for the Persian
                            Government upon satisfactory security.</p>
                        <p>There could be no doubt that the American market would not absorb two
                            Persian bond issues. He was accordingly convinced that the sole way out
                            of the difficulty was cooperation with the Sinclair Company, and was
                            quite certain that his principals would be willing to arrange for the
                            flotation of five million dollars of the proposed Sinclair loan.</p>
                        <p>Like a good diplomat, however, Mr. Lawrence Bennett did not draw
                            attention to what probably constitutes the main motive of his
                            willingness to cooperate. The Sinclair loan is to be made upon
                            satisfactory security. It has been definitely understood that the
                            Anglo-Persian oil royalties are to constitute this guarantee.
                            Consequently, Mr. Lawrence Bennett found himself confronted with the
                            preemption of the only really giltedged security in the country for the
                            purpose of backing up the Sinclair loan. Cooperation with the Sinclair,
                            consequently, was the only solution of the problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lawrence Bennett concluded with the suggestion that he telegraph his
                            principals of the proposed cooperation in financing this loan, and that
                            Mr. Ralph Soper do likewise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ralph Soper replied that he had no objection whatever, assuming that
                            the Ulen Company had no other connections than those stated, to
                            cooperating to the best of his ability. He offered to cable his
                            principals as suggested, and expressed his personal gratification at the
                            prospect of American capital actively cooperating in North <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0648"/>Persian affairs. For two companies such
                            as Ulen Co., and Sinclair to be at cross purposes, and both actively
                            engaged in trying to float a loan, could not but injure the prospects of
                            both parties; the Persian Government, as well as other interested
                            foreign powers, would only be too ready to take advantage of such
                            dissension.</p>
                        <p>Of course, there is no doubt that it is in the interest of the Sinclair
                            Company as well, to enter into the proposed arrangement. Under the best
                            of conditions it would be an extremely difficult matter for the Sinclair
                            unaided to float ten million dollars worth of bonds in the United
                            States, and the proposal of the Ulen Company to take over half the issue
                            cannot but be welcome.</p>
                        <p>The main difficulty with which Mr. Lawrence Bennett is confronted, of
                            course, is in arranging for the loan, when made, to be expended upon his
                            Company’s construction projects, whatever form they may take. Mr. Ralph
                            Soper went into this matter rather at length. The Sinclair Company is,
                            of course, not concerned with the disposition made of the loan when
                            raised, by the Persian Government. The general impression is that the
                            Premier, Reza Khan, intends to employ the proceeds, or a part of them,
                            for productive purposes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lawrence Bennett may encounter no little difficulty in persuading the
                            Persian Government to accept his proposal in its present form. Persian
                            Government circles are undoubtedly under the impression that he is here
                            for the purpose of negotiating a railroad concession, and not a
                            contracting project. There are rumors to the effect that the Premier’s
                            intention is to build railroads with Persian capital, from the Sinclair
                            loan and possibly the proceeds of a mortgage of the crown jewels with
                            which possibly $10,000,000 might be raised abroad. On the other hand,
                            the Government may desire to give a railroad concession, with mineral
                            rights along the right of way and in return for which a second loan
                            should be raised in the United States. It is too early as yet to
                            determine just what the attitude of the Government may be in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>It is my opinion that Mr. Lawrence Bennett will find it most difficult to
                            get the Persian Government to consent to earmark the proposed loan which
                            his company desires to make in collaboration with Sinclair, for
                            construction purposes. He may succeed in having a part of it thus
                            alloted, but even 50% would prove very little indeed for practical
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>… I do not believe that the Persian Government realizes the immense cost
                            of such a project.<note n="13a" xml:id="d482fn13a">A railroad connecting
                                the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf.</note> It is the opinion of

                            locally that Persia’s economic future would be better served by
                            concentration upon a road building scheme and encouragement of
                            motor-truck transport which would be sufficient to handle existing
                            freight for a long time to come. But the vision of a trunk line joining
                            up North and South Persia, with resulting military advantages, has a
                            very strong hold indeed upon the minds of the Premier and his
                            counsellors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lawrence Bennett is of the opinion that if a railroad project is
                            insisted upon, it could be accomplished only by slow degrees—two hundred
                            miles of road could be built within the next few years and measures
                            subsequently taken to finance an extension of the project. I do not
                            believe that Mr. Lawrence Bennett himself as yet realizes the opposition
                            that may be encountered in this connection from foreign quarters. The
                            Government is supposed to have the intention of commencing operations
                            from the Persian Gulf and building north. The Russians would certainly
                            object to any such procedure. On the contrary, the British would
                            certainly not look kindly upon an attempt to start operations from the
                            Northern end. Perhaps a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> may be
                            arrived at by pursuing operations simultaneously from both the Caspian
                            and Persian Gulf ends.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, my personal conviction is that Mr. Lawrence Bennett started
                            from the United States with the intention of doing business with the
                            Persian Government independently of the Sinclair. The granting of the
                            concession while he was en route deranged his plans, and certain local
                            happenings lead me to believe that he received instructions immediately
                            upon his arrival to cooperate with the Sinclair Company. Dr. A. C.

                            himself says, advised him to combine with Sinclair if possible.</p>
                        <p>Both parties are now awaiting advice from their principals. It is to be
                            hoped that these two companies find collaboration practicable as a
                            united front locally would render the task of both much easier.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Lawrence Bennett expects Mr. Ruan of the Ulen Company who has been
                            detailed for a similar purpose, to arrive within a month’s time.</p>
                        <p>I shall keep the Department duly informed of developments.</p>

                        <p>Referring to my report of January 22, 1924, entitled “Cooperation of
                            Sinclair Exploration Company and Ulen Company in Persian Bond Issue”, I
                            have the honor to inform the Department that Mr. Bennett interviewed the
                            Prime Minister, Reza Khan, yesterday morning. He stated that his firm
                            was interested in the construction of public works for the Persian
                            Government and requested that the Government inform him of its
                            intentions, and as to just what projects it desired to accord priority
                            of construction. Reza Khan, of course, lost no time in enlarging upon …
                            the construction of a railroad to a Persian Gulf port; the Prime
                            Minister declared that he would be most happy to enter into relations
                            with a reputable American Company with a view to its realization.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bennett specifically inquired whether the field was clear and whether
                            any obstacles existed in the way of prior concessions or options. The
                            question of the British controlled Persian Railways Syndicate’s existing
                            option on both the Mohammerah–Khoramabad line and the Khanikin–Teheran
                            line was raised. Reza Khan was inclined to regard them both as having
                            lapsed; Mr. Bennett privately expressed to me his opinion that they
                            would bear looking into, as well as his disinclination to undertake
                            especially the southern railway project if any prior British claim
                            existed which could be utilized as propaganda against the Persian loan
                            which his company might desire to float in the United States in this
                            connection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bennett, in concluding, requested of Reza Khan that the Persian
                            Government apprize him of the specific project which it had in mind, in
                            order that he might transmit same to his company.</p>
                        <p>He also asked the Prime Minister whether he would be disposed to sign a
                            preliminary contract for perhaps six months duration, in the event that
                            the Government’s offer was adjudged to be practicable, and Reza Khan
                            stated that he had no objection to so doing.</p>
                        <p>Within the next day or so, I hope to have in my possession certain
                            correspondence between the Persian Government, the Persian Railways
                            Syndicate (holders of the so-called option), the text of the 1920 option
                            on the construction of the Khanikin–Bagdad route, and several letters of
                            Prince Firouz, former Persian Premier, of which <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0651"/>I shall send copies<note n="15" xml:id="d483fn15">Not printed.</note> to the Department, which, I do

                        <p>15. I have been asked informally by the British Minister to explain to
                            Bennett that the British will uphold validity of option granted to the
                            Persian Railways Syndicate. British Minister also made it plain that,
                            while American interests would be gladly admitted to participation, yet
                            if either Persia or America declined to accept an arrangement Persia’s
                            chief securities could not be pledged to American loan until British
                            claims against Persia had been taken care of. I was given to understand
                            also that the British might consider it necessary to revert to the
                            economic, although not the political, arrangements of 1907 in order to
                            safeguard their interests.</p>

                            Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs I have the honour to
                            inform you that <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0653"/>the attention
                            of His Majesty’s Government has been drawn to the fact that an American
                            group has been negotiating for a concession from the Persian Government
                            for the construction of a railway from Mohammerah to Khorrembad and
                            Tehran.</p>
                        <p>It is the desire of His Majesty’s Government to be perfectly frank with
                            the United States Government in this matter and in order to avoid the
                            possibility of future misunderstanding or conflicting claims I have been
                            instructed to communicate to you in the most friendly manner the two

                            the co-operation of American firms of good standing with the Persian
                            Railway Syndicate in these matters, and you will recall that efforts
                            were made in the course of last year to secure such American
                            participation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose herewith
                            memorandum submitted to me by Mr. L. E. Bennett,<note n="20" xml:id="d489fn20">Not printed.</note> representing the Ulen &amp;
                            Company of <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0654"/>New York City,
                            relating to the loan his company would have to negotiate should it be
                            awarded the contract for the construction of railways or motor roads in
                            Persia.</p>
                        <p>To my mind, Mr. Bennett’s suggestion to combine the Ulen loan with that
                            of the Sinclair Exploration Company has much in its favor. Mr. Lambert
                            Molitor, the Director General of Customs, advises me that normally the
                            Persian customs amount to Tomans 6,000,000 per annum. Of this, 2,500,000
                            are pledged for the yearly interest and amortization of the funded
                            British loan. The remaining 3,500,000 ought to be sufficient for the
                            payment of the interest and amortization of a loan of $20,000,000,
                            provided, of course, that the Persian Government would obligate itself
                            not to divert any of these customs for any other purpose. The best
                            assurance for this would be the continuance of the American Financial
                            Mission. Unless the Ulen company succeeds in combining its loan with
                            that of the Sinclair company, there is no doubt that the latter would
                            endeavor to obtain a lien on all these customs. The only collateral that
                            would then be available would be the Anglo-Persian oil royalties, which,
                            though the property of the Persian Government, the British might oppose
                            being given as security for an American loan for the construction of
                            railways for which they claim to have an option.</p>
                        <p>In view of the statement made to me by the Prime Minister in regard to
                            the manner in which Persia intends to draw the funds placed to her
                            credit by an American loan, (see Legation’s despatch No. 467 of April
                                23),<note n="21" xml:id="d489fn21">Not printed.</note> it would
                            appear that there is a far greater sense of responsibility and economy
                            in the present government than in those that preceded it. There is every
                            indication that this government will maintain itself for some time; but
                            even if it should fall sooner than expected, it will have set a
                            wholesome example to its successors. This therefore would seem to be an
                            opportune time for American enterprise to gain a foothold in Persia. If
                            the Ulen company’s project could be launched it might be the beginning
                            of a great industrial movement in Persia.</p>
                        <p>I should be very pleased if the Department would communicate to me its
                            impression of the views expressed in the enclosed memorandum.</p>

                                    <p>It is understood that iron and coal mines exist in places
                                        through which the proposed railroads should pass and the
                                        Persian Government desires to utilize these mines for the
                                        construction of the railroads. The Company is prepared to
                                        undertake investigations of any known iron or coal mines in

                                        undertaken for account of the Government. The Company will
                                        organize a Commission of Experts in the United States with
                                        the cooperation and approval of the Persian Minister in
                                        Washington. The Experts will be competent high class
                                        specialists who will study the matter of mines thoroughly
                                        and impartially with a view to their use in supplying
                                        materials for the construction and operation of the

                                        practical use in connection with the proposed railroads, the

                                        aspect of this problem which will enable the Persian

                                        exploitation of the mines. If the report of the Expert shows
                                        that mines exist and it is practical and economical to work
                                        them and manufacture iron and steel materials in Persia,
                                        then the Government can proceed and may count always upon
                                        the loyal cooperation of the Company to assist in every

                            for construction of railways will not terminate until September 25. His
                            view seems to be that prospects are dubious for Ulen Company in Persia
                            since Imbrie’s death and since Sinclair agent has left country. Ulen and
                            Sinclair had practically arranged to unite in loan to Persians, and Ruan
                            feels that success of joint enterprise is now uncertain.</p>

                            <p>The question of payment by foreigners of the taxes established by the
                                Municipality has been for some time the subject of exchanges of view
                                between the Imperial Minister for Foreign Affairs and the various
                                Legations. Desirous of finding a just solution to this question,
                                their Excellencies, the Ministers of Great Britain, France, United
                                States of America, as well as the Chargé d’Affaires of Italy, agreed
                                with the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to examine it in the most
                                conciliatory spirit. From this examination, it has resulted that
                                there is reason to distinguish in this request two essential points: <list>
                                    <label>1)</label>
                                    <item>regard for the text of the treaties as far as the
                                        importation of merchandise from abroad is concerned;</item>
                                    <label>2)</label>
                                    <item>the legal uniformity of the taxes which the Municipalities
                                        might impose and the guarantees as to their
                                        application.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>In considering the first of these distinctions, the representatives
                                of the Powers above-mentioned have deemed that it would be
                                absolutely impossible for them to admit any tax contravening
                                directly the texts of the treaties. Now the prescriptions imposed by
                                the Municipality providing that foreign merchandise must pay a tax
                                on entering the Municipal territory is in contravention of these
                                texts.</p>
                            <p>The latter stipulate in fact that merchandise, imported from abroad
                                having on its entrance into Persia paid the customs duties regularly
                                established, will not be subject to the collection of any further
                                duty. No exceptional tax can be claimed. Merchandise imported from
                                abroad after having paid the customs duty must, under these
                                conditions, be transported freely to the interior of the country as
                                far as their destination without any Municipality having the right
                                to intervene and exact taxes affecting the transportation of
                                merchandise. This principle established—and the undersigned chiefs
                                of missions do not doubt that it is recognized as just by the
                                Imperial Government—the pretension of the Municipalities submitted
                                for their approval by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make
                                foreigners pay certain taxes from which they have been exempted
                                until now, might subsequently be favorably examined with the
                                reservation that this question would be the subject of a preliminary
                                understanding between the interested <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0661"/>Legations and the Imperial Government and after a
                                uniform law on the Municipalities had been voted by the
                                Medjliss.</p>
                            <p>As for the so-called road taxes (<hi rend="italic">voiries</hi>),
                                established by the Municipalities on the uniform basis of
                                legislative prescriptions, they might be submitted for payment by
                                foreign subjects with the guarantee that they would be entirely
                                applied to the upkeep and improvement of an organized municipal
                                service.</p>
                            <p>As soon as the Imperial Government will have agreed with them on
                                these principles, the undersigned chiefs of missions will not fail
                                to report for the approval of their respective Governments the
                                conditions under which modifications might be effected in the system
                                existing until the present time with regard to the payment of taxes
                                by foreign nationals.</p>
                            <p>Persuaded that their desire to cause these modifications to be
                                admitted in an equitable manner will be understood by the Persian
                                Government, they are convinced that it will reply favorably in such
                                a way as to facilitate their task.</p>

                            my Government, to inform you that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran
                            recently asked His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs for a ruling regarding the validity in general of the treaty of
                            Turcomanchai, (signed in 1828 between Russia and Persia)<note n="29" xml:id="d495fn29"><hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State

                            enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government and British subjects in Persia.</p>
                        <p>Sir P. Loraine expressed himself as doubtful whether it would be wise to
                            leave unchallenged the Persian Government’s contention that no claims
                            can be based on the treaty of Turcomanchai, because it has been annulled
                            by the Russo-Persian Treaty of 1921,<note n="30" xml:id="d495fn30">League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ix</hi>,
                                p. 401.</note> although, hitherto, no such assertion has yet been
                            made in any official communication addressed to him direct by the
                            Persian Government. The question arose, however, incidentally in the
                            course of conversation between Sir P. Loraine and the Persian Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs, who seemed quite astonished to learn that not only
                            His Majesty’s Government but also other Christian governments maintained
                            that the treaty of Turcomanchai was valid in their regard.</p>

                                42.</note> His Majesty’s Government are guaranteed most favoured
                            nation treatment. Furthermore, in order to safeguard British interests,
                            His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on December 23rd, 1920 addressed a
                            warning to the Persian Government that the rights and interests of His
                            Majesty’s Government could not be exposed to infringement by any
                            negotiations conducted by the Persian Government with the Russian Soviet
                            or other governments. In reply the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            stated on March 3rd, 1921 that “the Imperial Government have always
                            respected and protected the rights and interests of the British
                            Government” and that “whatever negotiations may be conducted with the
                            Soviet Government of Russia will not interfere with the foundation of
                            the relations between our respective governments. Of course this point
                            of view applies to the rights which British subjects have obtained in
                            accordance with the law and other legal disputes”.</p>
                        <p>Thus until recently Sir P. Loraine has continued to resist Persian
                            pretensions to consider the treaty of Turcomanchai, on which, hitherto,
                            British most favoured nation treatment has been regarded as resting, as
                            having lapsed on account of the conchision of the Russo-Persian Treaty
                            of 1921.</p>
                        <p>The whole question has now, however, received careful attention at the
                            hands of His Majesty’s Government, involving the consideration of the
                            three following points:— <list>

                            treaties “concluded by the late Tsarist Government”. Clause II declares
                            null and void “all conventions … concluded by the late Government of
                            Russia”. There can be little doubt that the intention, as confirmed by
                            practice, was that the cancellation applied to all treaties concluded by
                            the Tsarist system of government rather than those concluded by a
                            particular, i. e. the late Government. For instance, Clause 16 of the
                            1921 Treaty completely reverses the privileges conferred on Russians by
                            the 1828 Treaty.</p>
                        <p>As regards point (2), His Majesty’s Government have not, hitherto, signed
                            a formal treaty with the present Russian Government similar <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0663"/>to the 1921 agreement between Russia
                            and Persia. Such an act would involve <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>
                            recognition. But <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> recognition on the part
                            of His Majesty’s Government and the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian
                            Trade Agreement have forced His Majesty’s Government to recognise the
                            validity of Russian legislation, and by analogy it would seem to follow
                            that His Majesty’s Government recognised as being in force their treaty
                            arrangements with other powers. Moreover, the recognition by the allied
                            powers of the right of the Soviet Government to sign the Straits
                            Convention in the Treaty of Lausanne<note n="32" xml:id="d495fn32">League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">xxviii</hi>, p. 116.</note> would appear to strengthen the
                            above arguments.</p>
                        <p>Regarding point (3), the most favoured nation rights which His Majesty’s
                            Government derive from the 1828 treaty of Turcomanchai are indirect in
                            their nature. His Majesty’s Government demand that no Russian should be
                            treated preferentially to a British subject. But they have no absolute
                            right to claim any treatment which may have been accorded to Russians in
                            the past, but which is now withheld. It therefore follows that His
                            Majesty’s Government have not actually lost any rights at all and that
                            they have not got a good case for a protest that they were not consulted
                            before the abrogation of the treaty of Turcomanchai.</p>
                        <p>The view of His Majesty’s Government is, therefore, that it would be
                            wrong to base any claim against the Persian Government on the supposed
                            continuance in force of the Treaty of Turcomanchai, and the case of His
                            Majesty’s Government for capitulatory rights must rest upon the rights
                            conceded by treaty to various other powers such as France
                            (Franco-Persian Treaty of 1855 Article 5. “Hertslet’s Persian Treaties”
                            page 82) and Germany (Treaty of 1873. “Hertslet’s Persian Treaties”
                            pages 84–92), and upon definite concessions granted to His Majesty’s
                            Government or upon usage, as is the case in Abyssinia.</p>
                        <p>Sir Percy Loraine has therefore been instructed to adopt the attitude
                            laid down in the preceding paragraph of this note, in case the Persian
                            Government should at any time raise the question of capitulatory rights
                            in Persia. He has, however, expressed the opinion, which is shared by
                            His Majesty’s Government, that should he have occasion to make a
                            communication in that sense to the Persian Government, the attitude of
                            other powers might thereby be prejudiced, since it is understood that
                            the representatives of France, Italy, the United States and Belgium are
                            disposed still to hold by the treaty of Turcomanchai.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government desire me to enquire
                            whether the point of view outlined above also represents the <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0664"/>attitude of the United States
                            Government in the matter. I am instructed to add that in inviting an
                            expression of the opinion of the United States Government, Lord Curzon
                            has in mind the desirability of the five Powers offering, if possible, a
                            united front in this important question in case of a challenge by the
                            Persian Government.</p>
                        <p>A similar enquiry is being addressed to the French, Italian and Belgian
                            Governments by His Majesty’s representatives at Paris, Rome and
                            Brussels.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to inform you that His
                            Majesty’s Government have recently had under consideration the legal
                            basis of their attitude in Persia in the question of the taxation of
                            British subjects in that country, and in this connection I transmit to
                            you herewith copy of a memorandum containing the views of His Majesty’s
                            Minister at Tehran in regard to this matter.</p>
                        <p>As my Government understand that the contents of this document have
                            already been communicated to you by the United States Representative in
                            Persia, I am instructed to state that Sir Percy Loraine’s attitude on
                            this subject, as expressed in the enclosed memorandum, has the entire
                            approval of His Majesty’s Government.</p>

                                    Persia</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Loraine</hi>) <hi rend="italic">on the Liability of the Subjects of Powers Enjoying
                                    Capitulations in Persia to Pay Persian Taxation, Whether
                                    Imperial or Municipal</hi></head>
                            <p>The question has been raised in the following form: (1) Do foreign
                                subjects in Persia enjoy immunity from Persian taxation; and, if so,
                                (2) in virtue of what treaty right is such immunity claimed?</p>
                            <p>The answer to this question in the form put is: (1) Yes—in practice;
                                (2) there is no specific treaty provision.</p>
                            <p>The question, however, though it appears to go to the root of the
                                matter, does not in fact do so, and is actually somewhat misleading.
                                I think there is no difficulty in demonstrating its fallacy.</p>
                            <p>The fundamental consideration is that no State has the right to
                                impose taxation except on persons who are under its
                                jurisdiction.</p>
                            <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0665"/>
                            <p>The subjects in Persia of the Powers enjoying Capitulations are not
                                under Persian jurisdiction, but under that of their national
                                authority.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the Persian authorities are unable to collect taxation from
                                foreign subjects, except with the acquiescence of the latter’s
                                national authority; they are doubly unable to do so because foreign
                                subjects enjoy by treaty inviolability of person, property and
                                domicile. Therefore, if taxation claimed be withheld by a foreign
                                subject, the Persian authorities are debarred from proceeding with
                                any form of distraint.</p>
                            <p>The situation which exists as regards taxation is therefore inherent
                                in the capitulatory regime itself and is inseparable therefrom.</p>
                            <p>If further evidence of this were needed it can be found in the text
                                of notes repeatedly addressed by the Persian Government to His
                                Majesty’s Legation, and no doubt to other Legations also, requesting
                                the Minister to “instruct” his nationals to pay such and such a
                                tax.</p>
                            <p>What the Christian Legations therefore claim is that their consent is
                                necessary before any Persian tax can be legally levied on their
                                nationals, and it seems clear that this position is understood and
                                conformed to by the Persian Government.</p>
                            <p>Before giving their consent to the levy of a particular tax the
                                Legations are certainly justified in seeking guarantees in regard to
                                the equitable incidence of the proposed tax, for they are the
                                guardians of the interests of their nationals in Persia, and they
                                reside in a country subject to Islamic law, which does not admit the
                                principle of equality as between believers and unbelievers.</p>
                            <p>Equally, where the tax is levied in respect of services rendered, the
                                Legations are justified in seeking reasonable guarantees that the
                                moneys collected will be employed for the purposes for which it has
                                been levied.</p>
                            <p>Such guarantees are, moreover, in the interest of the Persian
                                Government themselves, for they are thereby encouraged to perfect
                                their fiscal and administrative legislation, the present
                                deficiencies of which are one of the <hi rend="italic">raisons
                                    d’être</hi> of the Capitulations, and one of the grounds of
                                necessity for maintaining them.</p>
                            <p>It is obvious that the use of this position to place a foreign
                                subject in an unduly favourable position to compete commercially
                                with his Persian rivals would be unjustified and abusive. There has,
                                however, never been any suggestion, so far as I am aware, that the
                                representatives of the Christian Powers have ever contemplated such
                                an abuse, and I am quite certain they would never countenance
                                it.</p>

                            the British Embassy’s note of September 27, 1923, which presents the
                            question of the present validity of the Treaty between Russia and
                            Persia, signed at Turcomanchai in 1828, and also of the note of October
                            25, dealing with the legal basis of the British Government’s attitude in
                            the matter of the taxation of British subjects in Persia. In the former

                            Majesty’s Government and the British representative in Teheran,
                            reference is made to the particular consideration which has been given

                        <p>At the conclusion of the Embassy’s communication this Government’s
                            attention is called to the suggestion of the British Minister in Teheran
                            that if the United States or other Powers are still inclined to base
                            rights upon the Treaty of Turcomanchai the position of this and of other
                            Governments might possibly be prejudiced should the British Government
                            acquiesce in the view that the Treaty in question is no longer in
                            effect. In these circumstances your Government has courteously inquired
                            whether the point of view with regard to the Treaty of Turcomanchai
                            which you have outlined in some detail represents the attitude of the
                            United States Government, adding that Lord Curzon has in mind the
                            desirability of the interested Powers offering, if possible, a united
                            front in this important question in case of a challenge by the Persian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the question whether the Treaty of 1921 between Persia and
                            Soviet Russia specifically cancels the Treaty of Turcomanchai it is
                            indicated to be the view of His Britannic Majesty’s Government that “the
                            intention, as confirmed by practice, was that the cancellation applied
                            to all Treaties concluded by the Tsarist system of Government.” In
                            discussing the second point mentioned above you refer to the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> recognition of the present Russian
                            regime by His Britannic Majesty’s Government, the conclusion of the
                            Anglo-Russian agreement, and the recognition by the Allied Powers of the
                            right of the Soviet authorities to sign the Straits Convention <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0667"/>in the Treaty of Lausanne,
                            concluding the discussion of Point (3) with the statement that in the
                            view of your Government it would be wrong to base any claim against the
                            Persian Government on the supposed continuance in force of the Treaty
                            between Russia and Persia of 1828.</p>
                        <p>There can be little doubt of the evident intent and desire of the parties
                            to the Treaty of 1921 between Persia and the Soviet authorities to
                            abrogate the Treaty of Peace, including the supplementary Treaty of
                            Commerce, concluded between Russia and Persia at Turcomanchai on
                            February 10–22, 1828, in so far as these Treaties, in the words of the
                            Perso-Soviet agreement, may prejudice the rights of the people of
                            Persia. While this Government has not felt itself obligated to take
                            formal cognizance of the action of the Soviet authorities with regard to
                            the Treaties of Turcomanchai, it does not consider that acquiescence by
                            His Britannic Majesty’s Government in the present attitude of the
                            Persian and Soviet authorities with respect to these Treaties would
                            afford any ground for objection on the part of this Government. Nor
                            would this action by the British Government appear to be calculated to
                            prejudice the position of this Government or of its nationals in Persia
                            in view of the firm bases, other than the Treaty of Turcomanchai, upon
                            which such rights rest.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the desirability of offering a united front in case of a
                            challenge by the Persian Government in this question, I may state that
                            the Embassy’s communication does not appear definitely to outline the
                            common position which your Government would suggest might be adopted,
                            unless it be that which you indicate your Government has taken as
                            described in the instructions to the British representative in
                            Teheran.</p>
                        <p>If there should be any such challenge on the part of the Persian
                            Government, a new situation would be presented. Meanwhile, this
                            Government, while solicitous to preserve the rights necessary to the
                            proper protection of its citizens and interests in Persia, desires to
                            avoid a course of action which would result in obstructing the efforts
                            of the Persian Government to put its house in order and particularly to
                            establish its finances on a sound basis.</p>

                            of January 21, 1924,<note n="35" xml:id="d498fn35"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> dealing with the treaty between Russia and
                            Persia signed at Turcomanchai in 1828 and with the present status of the
                            rights of foreigners in Persia, particularly with reference to
                            taxation.</p>
                        <p>In drafting the reply to the British Embassy’s communications the
                            Department considered the recent correspondence from the Legation with
                            regard to the imposition of new measures of taxation by the Persian
                            authorities, particularly your despatches No. 231, August 5th; No. 225,
                            July 25th and No. 205, July 6th, 1923.<note n="36" xml:id="d498fn36">Last two despatches not printed.</note> From these communications
                            the Department understands that you joined certain of your colleagues in
                            sending a note to the Persian Government,<note n="37" xml:id="d498fn37">See joint note to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, <ref target="#pg_566">p. 566</ref>.</note> which in your despatches
                            of July 25th and August 5th is variously referred to as having been sent
                            on June 12, June 14 and June 22. This note contained a protest against
                            the imposition of certain municipal taxes on nationals of states
                            enjoying capitulatory rights. It would appear from other correspondence
                            from the Legation that on May 18, 1923 the British Minister requested
                            you to join in a further communication to the Persian Government
                            reiterating the position taken in the note of June, 1922. In bringing
                            the British Minister’s suggestion to the Department’s attention you
                            requested definite instructions as to the course you should pursue.</p>
                        <p>It would not appear from the information before the Department that you
                            joined your allied colleagues in any protest to the Persian Government
                            on the subject of taxes subsequent to the note of June, 1922. If this
                            Department’s impression on this point is not correct it is desired that
                            on receipt of this instruction you telegraph fully whether you have
                            participated in any further protest to the Persian Government and if so,
                            the nature of such protest.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s general attitude in this matter is briefly set forth in
                            the concluding paragraph of the note to the British Embassy, where it is
                            indicated that this Government, “while solicitous to preserve the rights
                            necessary to the proper protection of its citizens and interests in
                            Persia, desires to avoid a course of action which would result in
                            obstructing the efforts of the Persian Government to put its house in
                            order and particularly to establish its finances on a sound basis.” The
                            Department would therefore be inclined to follow a liberal policy in
                            dealing with requests from the Persian Government for the right to
                            collect reasonable taxes from American citizens, provided such taxes
                            were accepted by the nationals of other Powers <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0669"/>and were neither unduly severe nor
                            inequitably imposed. But this does not signify that the United States is
                            at present prepared to renounce its fundamental capitulatory rights in
                            Persia. The Department accordingly desires you in each individual case
                            where new taxes affecting Americans and other foreigners may be
                            contemplated, to request the Department’s instructions before
                            acquiescing in the levy of such new taxes.</p>
                        <p>In sending you the enclosed communications between the Department and the
                            British Embassy, the Department desires to caution you that these
                            communications are confidential and should not therefore be availed of
                            in correspondence with the Persian Government, with your colleagues, or

                            Embassy under date of September 27th and October 25th, 1923, and the
                            Department’s reply of January 21, 1924, dealing with the treaty between
                            Russia and Persia signed at Turcomanchai in 1828 and with the present
                            status of the rights of foreigners in Persia, particularly with
                            reference to taxation, I have the honor to report that the competent
                            official in the Royal Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has asserted
                            that his Government has addressed a reply to a similar inquiry from the
                            British, stating that his Government deems the question as to whether
                            the Treaty of Turcomanchai has been abrogated is, from the juridical
                            point of view, debatable.</p>
                        <p>The Italian Government feels, however, that for practical purposes it
                            would not be wise at the present time to acknowledge that the Treaty of
                            Turcomanchai has been abrogated. It is pointed out that the rights in
                            regard to penal matters granted in that Treaty are not reconferred in
                            subsequent treaties as are other classes of capitulatory rights.
                            Although such treaties as the Franco-Persian Treaty of 1855 and the
                            German-Persian Treaty of 1873 specify other classes of capitulatory
                            rights, those in regard to penal matters are granted on the basis of
                            most favored nation clauses. Therefore, the Italians deem it essential,
                            if and when the abrogation of the Treaty of Turcomanchai becomes an
                            actual issue, to secure from the Persian Government a specific <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0670"/>guarantee in regard to penal
                            matters before acknowledging such abrogation.</p>
                        <p>It was intimated that the French hold the same attitude on the subject as
                            the Italians. The Italians have not yet received an answer from the
                            British to their communication on this subject.</p>

                            attitude of the British Government. He said the civil rights of
                            Frenchmen in Persia were fully protected by the Franco-Persian Treaty of
                            1855, and, with regard to criminal procedure, the rights of foreigners
                            were equally protected by immemorial usage and he mentioned even the
                            Franco-Persian Treaty of 1715. He added that, in his opinion, the Treaty
                            of Turcomanchai had undoubtedly been abrogated, but in so far as the
                            French were concerned, they had certainly never derived any benefit
                            under it and in fact certain provisions, such as the execution in one
                            country of the decisions of the tribunals of the other, were contrary to
                            French law.</p>
                        <p>M. Fromageot had discussed the whole question with Sir Cecil Hurst<note n="41" xml:id="d500fn41">Legal adviser in the British Foreign
                                Office.</note> and he considered that no action need be taken unless
                            the Persian Government made an attempt to infringe on the rights of
                            foreigners in which event the Powers should get together and present an
                            united front.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It will be within your recollection that
                            in his note No. 836 of September 27th last, Mr. Chilton outlined the
                            views of His Majesty’s Government on the legal position of British
                            subjects in Persia resulting from the abrogation of the Treaty of
                            Turcomanchai by the <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0671"/>Russo-Persian Treaty of 1921, and at the same time enquired whether
                            the attitude of the United States Government was similar to that held by
                            His Majesty’s Government. In your reply dated January 21st, you were
                            good enough to inform my predecessor, that the United States Government
                            did not consider that the acquiescence by His Majesty’s Government in
                            the present attitude of the Persian and Soviet authorities would afford
                            it any ground for objection—nor did such action on the part of His
                            Majesty’s Government appear to be calculated to prejudice the position
                            of the United States Government or of its nationals in Persia, in view
                            of the firm bases, other than the Treaty of Turcomanchai, upon which
                            such rights rest.</p>
                        <p>The whole question of the capitulatory privileges enjoyed by British
                            subjects in Persia has continued to be under the consideration of His
                            Majesty’s Government, and I have been instructed by His Majesty’s
                            Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acquaint you with
                            the following synopsis of the instructions which he has sent to His
                            Majesty’s Minister in Teheran, for the guidance of Sir Percy Loraine in
                            his future dealings with the Persian Government.</p>
                        <p>It would not be desirable to admit in any discussion with the Persian
                            Government that the abrogation of the Treaty of Turcomanchai must
                            necessarily affect any rights in respect to exterritorial jurisdiction
                            enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in Persia … But apart from the
                            Treaty of Turcomanchai there are other bases, upon which the situation
                            of British subjects may be safeguarded.</p>
                        <p>In civil matters a secure foundation is to be found in the French Treaty
                            with Persia of 1855, and in the German Treaty of 1873, to the clauses of
                            which His Majesty’s Government are entitled to appeal by virtue of their
                            most-favoured-rights. Put briefly, the French Treaty provides that
                            disputes in civil matters between French citizens shall be settled by
                            French authorities—disputes between French and Persian nationals by the
                            Persian tribunals in the presence of a French representative, and
                            disputes between French citizens and nationals of other Powers by the
                            authorities of the countries concerned. These provisions, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis</hi>, cover British subjects’ and the
                            Persian Government would have no possible grounds for contesting the
                            right of British subjects to have their civil disputes settled in
                            accordance with the long established regime.</p>
                        <p>As regards criminal matters the position is more obscure because the
                            French and German treaties mentioned above only contain
                            most-favoured-nation-treatment, and do not specify details of procedure.
                            In criminal cases the procedure laid down in the Turcomanchai Treaty has
                            never been in effect—it is indeed impossible, that it could <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0672"/>ever have been carried out, for British
                            law would not permit of British authorities executing upon a British
                            subject a sentence, which had been imposed upon him by a Persian
                            tribunal. The present practice as regards British subjects who are
                            involved in criminal cases is analogous to that which applies to French
                            citizens and rests upon long usage rather than upon specific treaty
                            rights, and the arguments put forward by Sir P. Loraine in any dispute
                            with the Persian Government should take into account the length of time
                            during which the present system has been in vogue. For example the
                            (British) Persia Order-in-Council, which has governed British action
                            since 1889 makes no provision for carrying out the Turcomanchai
                            procedure, but Article 9 of that Order makes provision for the trial of
                            British subjects accused of offences against Persians or other foreign
                            nationals, which is entirely consistent with the usage, which had been
                            previously and since followed.</p>
                        <p>For example, at the present time a British subject accused of a criminal
                            offence against a foreigner who enjoys extra-territorial rights, would
                            be tried in the British Consular Court, and not (as laid down in the
                            Treaty of Turcomanchai) by a Persian tribunal in the presence of a
                            British representative. It is not known when this usage sprang up, but
                            even if it arose originally from a successful Russian attempt to stretch
                            the interpretation of the Treaty of Turcomanchai, this does not
                            necessarily mean that His Majesty’s Government are not now entitled to
                            rely upon such usage.</p>
                        <p>As regards criminal cases in which all the parties concerned are British
                            subjects, it has been impossible to obtain any information as to the
                            practice before 1828. As, however, such cases are normally the first on
                            which jurisdiction is conferred on Consuls, it is extremely probable
                            that such jurisdiction existed before the signature of the Treaty of
                            Turcomanchai, and it is within the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government
                            that the French Government considers its extra-territorial rights on
                            this point as long antedating that Treaty. In these circumstances, His
                            Majesty’s Government are of opinion that British subjects would be
                            entitled to the same treatment as is allowed to French citizens.</p>
                        <p>In view of these considerations, Mr. Secretary MacDonald has instructed
                            His Majesty’s Minister in Persia to avoid raising the question with the
                            Persian Government, and to assume that extra-territorial rights will
                            continue to be enjoyed by British subjects in Persia in the same
                            respects in future as in the past. If, however, the Persian authorities
                            press Sir Percy Loraine on the point at issue, he is to urge that in
                            matters of civil import British subjects have clearly defined treaty
                            rights, quite irrespective of any provisions arising from the Treaty of
                            Turcomanchai, and that criminal questions are held by His Majesty’s
                            Government to come under the category <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0673"/>of rights established by custom. In any case, Sir Percy
                            is to contend that extra-territorial rights in matters of jurisdiction
                            must be treated as a whole, and that an obviously impossible situation
                            would arise if it was urged by the Persian authorities that His
                            Majesty’s Government had a clear treaty right to ex-territorial
                            jurisdiction in civil cases, but no rights at all in criminal
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>In instructing me to inform you in confidence of the above views of His
                            Majesty’s Government, Mr. MacDonald states that he is simultaneously
                            communicating them to the Governments of France, Italy and Belgium
                            through His Majesty’s representatives, in order that the Ministers in
                            Teheran of these countries may be acquainted with the line, which will
                            be taken by Sir Percy Loraine in the event of the question being raised
                            by the Persian Government. Mr. Mac-Donald has expressed to me the hope
                            that you may concur in his views on this question, and that, in that
                            case, you may be pleased to instruct the United States Minister in
                            Persia to adopt a similar attitude should the Persian authorities
                            endeavour to discuss with him the problems of extra-territoriality.</p>

                            receipt of Your Excellency’s communication of March 15, 1924 in which,
                            with reference to previous correspondence which dealt in some detail
                            with the question of extraterritorial rights in Persia, you have
                            outlined the attitude to be taken by the representative of His Majesty’s
                            Government in Persia in the event that the question should be raised by
                            the Persian Government. In the concluding paragraph of your
                            communication you express the hope that this Government concurs in the
                            views outlined in your communication as to the basis on which
                            extraterritorial rights in Persia rest and that the United States
                            representative in Persia will be instructed to adopt an attitude similar
                            to that of his British colleague in case the Persian authorities should
                            endeavor to raise the question of extraterritoriality.</p>
                        <p>In reply I may state that a copy of Your Excellency’s communication is
                            being forwarded to the American Minister at Teheran for his confidential
                            information. The Minister has been instructed to advise the Department
                            of any effort on the part of the Persian Government to take up with him
                            the question of extraterritoriality in order that appropriate
                            instructions to meet the point at issue might in that event be sent him.
                            In this connection I would particularly direct your <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0675"/>attention to the concluding paragraphs

                                    after customs duties are collected on such goods. This provision

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to inform you that the
                            growth of the illicit opium traffic from ports in the Persian Gulf to
                            China and other Far Eastern countries has for some time past been the
                            subject of serious conversations by His Majesty’s Government and
                            detailed study has been devoted to the possibility of devising means to
                            control this traffic at any rate so far as consignments shipped in
                            British vessels are concerned. As a result it has now been decided to
                            issue King’s Regulations on the subject to His Majesty’s Consular
                            Officers in the Persian Gulf laying down the procedure to be observed in
                            future before granting clearance to a British ship with a cargo of opium
                            on board. The regulations, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, are to
                            be issued on January 1, 1925, this date having been selected in order
                            that the Persian Government may first be given the opportunity of
                            cooperating in the control of the opium traffic and, also, having regard
                            to the very considerable interests involved in Persia and elsewhere, in
                            order to avoid the financial and economic dislocation which would
                            inevitably occur were the proposed measures to be brought into force
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires at Teheran has been requested to
                            communicate the text of these regulations to the Persian Government and
                            to invite suggestions from them as to the best method of securing their
                            cooperation with His Majesty’s Government in controlling exports of
                            opium from Persia. Mr. Ovey has at the same time been instructed to draw
                            the attention of the Persian Government to Article 3 of the
                            International Opium Convention<note n="75" xml:id="d506fn75">Malloy, <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>, 1910–1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">iii</hi>, p. 3025.</note> and to emphasize the
                            fact that His Majesty’s Government are bound, by their obligations under
                            that Convention, to do all in their power to prevent the export of opium
                            to countries such as China, which have prohibited its entry, and to
                            control the export to countries which restrict its import. It is indeed
                            a notorious fact that a great part of the present traffic from the
                            Persian Gulf to the Far East is illicit i. e. is not covered by import
                            licenses granted by the authorities of the importing countries.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the likelihood of the
                            Persian Government proving amenable to representations in the <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0677"/>above sense would be very
                            materially increased were it possible for the United States
                            representative at Tehran to associate himself with his British colleague
                            in the proposed <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi>. I accordingly have the
                            honour to enquire whether, in view of the great interest evinced by the
                            United States Government in all measures tending to the suppression of
                            the opium traffic and having regard to the considerable public attention
                            given to this problem in this country, you would be prepared to instruct
                            the United States representative at Tehran to support the
                            representations of Mr. Ovey who has been instructed to postpone action
                            for the time in the hope of securing his American colleague’s support in
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>The prestige and influence enjoyed by the American Financial Adviser in
                            Persia would also render any assistance which he may be prepared to
                            offer of the greatest value and I have the honour to express the hope
                            that you may also see your way to intimate privately to Dr. Millspaugh
                            that you trust he will take such steps as may be possible to induce the
                            Persian Government to cooperate wholeheartedly with His Majesty’s
                            Government with a view to securing the suppression of this traffic.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of Your Excellency’s note No. 624 of July 10, 1924, with regard
                            to the illicit trade in opium from ports in the Persian Gulf to China
                            and other far eastern countries. In this communication you indicate that
                            the British Government has decided to issue regulations to its consular
                            officers in the Persian Gulf setting forth the procedure to be observed
                            in granting clearance to British vessels carrying cargoes of opium. You
                            further state that before the regulations in question are issued the
                            British Government proposes to invite the Persian Government to
                            cooperate in the control of the opium traffic in the Persian Gulf, in
                            view of the very considerable financial and economic interests of the
                            latter government. You also inquire, under instructions from your
                            Government, whether the Government of the United States, in view of the
                            interest it has taken in the regulation of the traffic in opium, would
                            be inclined to instruct the American Minister at Teheran to support the
                            representations which His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires has been
                            instructed to make.</p>
                        <p>In reply I have the honor to state that subject to the reservation in the
                            concluding paragraph of this note, the Department is instructing the
                            American Minister at Teheran to inform the appropriate Persian
                            authorities that the Government of the United States trusts that the
                            Persian Government will take the necessary steps to obtain a more
                            effective control of the traffic in opium with a view to the elimination
                            of the illicit traffic in that drug.</p>
                        <p>The American Minister is being instructed also to inform the Persian
                            authorities that this Government has taken stringent measures to
                            regulate the traffic in opium so far as the United States and its
                            possessions are concerned, and that any action which may be taken by the
                            Persian Government to suppress the illegal opium traffic in south Persia
                            would be helpful to the United States in making more effective its own
                            regulations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to your suggestion that the Department intimate to the
                            Administrator General of the Finances of Persia the desirability of
                            inducing the Persian Government to cooperate in this matter, I would add
                            that while the Department is following with interest the work of the
                            Financial Adviser it refrains from making suggestions to him otherwise
                            than through the regular channels of the competent Persian authorities.
                            The third, fourth and fifth quarterly reports of the Administrator
                            General indicate, however, that plans have already been made which, if
                            carried out, will result in a closer supervision of the domestic
                            consumption as well as of the <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0679"/>international trade in opium. These reports also show that some
                            progress has been made in the extension of the control of this
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I desire, however, to add that pending a satisfactory
                            settlement by the Persian Government of the questions arising from the
                            killing in Teheran of Vice Consul Imbrie,<note n="76" xml:id="d507fn76">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_539">p. 539</ref>.</note> this
                            Government would not be disposed to make the representations outlined
                            above, and the American Minister has been so advised.</p>

                            July 10, 1924, from the British Ambassador at Washington, of which a
                            copy is enclosed,<note n="77" xml:id="d508fn77"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_582">p. 582</ref>.</note> which
                            refers to certain instructions to British Consular Officers in the
                            Persian Gulf, concerning the illicit trade in opium. The note also
                            inquires whether this Government would be disposed to instruct you to
                            inform the Persian Government of the interest of the United States in
                            the adoption of measures tending to suppress the illegal traffic in
                            opium.</p>
                        <p>In the light of reports received by the Department which indicate that
                            there is a substantial illicit trade in opium in Persian Gulf ports, the
                            Department considers that it would be entirely appropriate for you to
                            bring this matter to the attention of the Persian Government, and to
                            state that it is this Government’s hope that the Persian Government will
                            be in a position to enforce regulations which would result in bringing
                            the illicit opium trade to an end.</p>
                        <p>You may further refer to the fact that this Government is much interested
                            in the suppression of the illicit traffic in opium, that it has taken
                            stringent measures to regulate this trade as far as the United States
                            and its possessions are concerned, and any action which may be taken by
                            the Persian Government to suppress the illegal opium traffic would be
                            helpful to the United States in making more effective its own
                            regulations.</p>
                        <p>Before making such representations you may confer with your British
                            colleague in order that the representations which you may make may, as
                            nearly as possible, coincide in time with those to be made by the
                            British representative.</p>
                        <p>You will observe the statement in the Department’s communication to the
                            British Government with respect to the suggested representations to
                            Doctor Millspaugh on this subject. Having noted the <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0680"/>plans outlined in the third, fourth and
                            fifth quarterly reports of the Administrator General of the Finances of
                            Persia for the control of the opium traffic, the Department assumes that
                            Dr. Millspaugh already appreciates the interest of this Government in
                            the effective control of the traffic in opium.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the last paragraph of the note to the British Embassy and
                            in the Department’s telegram No. 65 of August 13, 4 p.m.,<note n="78" xml:id="d508fn78">Not printed.</note> the above instruction is only
                            to be acted upon if a satisfactory settlement by the Persian Government
                            of the questions arising from the killing in Teheran of Vice Consul
                            Imbrie has been reached. Otherwise the Government would not be disposed
                            to make representations in other matters not of immediate urgency.</p>

                        <p>83. 1. The Department hopes that the Government of Persia will be
                            represented at the forthcoming opium conference at Geneva in November
                            next. The question of production of raw opium is one of prime importance
                            and without the cooperation of the producing countries it will be
                            difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The Department suggests,
                            therefore, that you communicate the views of this Government to the
                            Government of Persia through appropriate channels in substantially the
                            following form: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As the Government of Persia is undoubtedly aware, a conference
                                    to consider measures to restrict the traffic in opium and other
                                    dangerous drugs will be held in Geneva in November of this year.
                                    This is a humanitarian question of world-wide importance in
                                    which the Government of the United States has always been deeply
                                    interested, and it is hoped that the Persian Government will
                                    find it possible to participate in the work of the
                                    conference.</p>
                                <p>One of the principal questions to be considered is the production
                                    of raw opium and its transportation in international commerce.
                                    It is the earnest hope of this Government that the Government of
                                    Persia will cooperate in an international effort to terminate
                                    the production and transportation of raw opium in quantities
                                    over and above those needed for medicinal purposes, thereby
                                    attacking the problem at its source.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States would be glad to have the
                                    views of the Government of Persia in this regard, and hopes that
                                    the delegates at the conference will be prepared to discuss
                                    sympathetically this fundamental point, with a view to accepting

                        <p>2. In addition to the above communication to the Persian Government the
                            Department desires that you should make certain oral representations as
                            well. See Department’s telegram No. 65, August 12 [<hi rend="italic">13</hi>], 4 p.m.<note n="79" xml:id="d509fn79">Not printed; see
                                despatch no. 652, Sept. 23, from the Chargé in Persia, <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi></note> On August 22 the Department
                            addressed to you a written communication enclosing a copy of a note
                            dated July 10 received from the British Ambassador at Washington,
                            referring to certain instructions to British consular officers in the
                            Persian Gulf concerning the illicit trade in opium, and a copy of the
                            Department’s reply. The note also inquired whether this Government would
                            be disposed to instruct you to inform the Persian Government of the
                            interest of the United States in the adoption of measures tending to
                            suppress illicit traffic in opium. In replying to this note the
                            Department stated that action would be taken by you only if a
                            satisfactory settlement by the Persian Government of the questions
                            arising in the killing in Teheran of Vice-Consul Imbrie had been
                            reached. While the Department does not consider that at the present time
                            entire satisfaction has been secured in the Imbrie case, nevertheless,
                            in view of the expressed acquiescence of the Persian Government in
                            certain of the demands of this Government and in view of the importance
                            which this Government attaches to the control of illicit traffic in
                            opium, the Department considers it advisable for you to proceed with the
                            suggested representations at once.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it would be entirely appropriate for you to
                            bring the matter to the attention of the Persian Government and to state
                            that it is this Government’s hope that the Persian Government will be in
                            a position to enforce regulations which would result in bringing the
                            illicit opium trade to an end. You may state that any action which may
                            be taken by the Persian Government to suppress the illegal opium traffic
                            would be helpful to the United States in making more effective its own
                            very stringent regulations in that connection.</p>
                        <p>[3.] Before making such representations you may confer with your British
                            colleague in order that your representations may, as nearly as possible,
                            coincide in time with those to be made by him. Department assumes that
                            your British colleague will be pleased to furnish you detailed
                            information as to the attitude of the British Government in this matter
                            and to show you a draft copy of the King’s Regulations relating to the
                            control of the traffic in opium between the Persian Gulf and the Far
                            East which the Department understands are to be issued on January 1,
                            1925.</p>
                        <p>The Department, in reply to an inquiry in the British note, stated that
                            it refrains from making suggestions to the American financial <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0682"/>adviser otherwise than through
                            the regular channels of the competent Persian authorities. The
                            Department assumes, however, that Dr. Millspaugh already appreciates the
                            interest of this Government in the effective control of the traffic in
                            opium.</p>

                            bringing to the attention of the Persian Government the reported illicit
                            trade in opium from the Persian Gulf ports, and instructing the Legation

                            and the Department’s telegram No. 83 of September 15, 5 p.m. regarding
                            the hope of the American Government that the Persian Government will be
                            represented at the forthcoming opium conference in Geneva in November
                            next, I have the honor to inform the Department that, on the day of the
                            receipt of these latter instructions, a note dated September 16, 1924
                            was delivered to the Persian Government transmitting the substance of
                            paragraph one of the instruction in question. A copy of this note is
                            herewith appended for the information of the Department.<note n="80" xml:id="d510fn79">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>On the same day I discussed the matter informally with Dr. A. C.
                            Millspaugh and was informed that the Persian Government would, in fact,
                            be represented at Geneva by Mirza Eissa Khan, the Persian oil
                            commissioner attached to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in London. The
                            Department was duly advised of this fact in the Legation’s telegram No.
                            120 of September 17, 2 p.m.<note n="81" xml:id="d510fn81"><ref target="frus1924v01#pg_100">Vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p.

                        <p>Dr. Millspaugh, at the same time, promised to supply me with an
                            exhaustive report on the whole question of opium with relation to Persia
                            which is just being completed by Colonel MacCormack, the Director of
                            Direct and Indirect Taxation in Persia. This report, I inferred, will
                            contain a consideration of measures that must be taken in order to
                            enable Persia to substitute other crops, namely, wheat, cotton, tobacco
                            and silk for opium. From a remark in a conversation which I recently had
                            with Colonel MacCormack I gathered that Persia contemplates demanding
                            aid even to the extent of financial subsidies from the nations most
                            interested in suppressing <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0683"/>opium
                            traffic in order to enable her to reduce opium production in the country
                            without imperilling her economic welfare.</p>
                        <p>On September 17 I likewise addressed a note to the British Chargé
                            d’Affaires requesting the appointment of a time suitable to him when I
                            might discuss the question in the light of my last instructions.</p>
                        <p>At the time agreed upon, September 23, he expressed his pleasure at the
                            present attitude of the American Government and informed me that the
                            King’s Regulations referred to in paragraph 3 of the Department’s
                            telegram No. 83, September 15, 5 p.m. had already, upon August 15, been
                            notified to the Persian Government together with a covering despatch on
                            the subject, a copy of which is herewith enclosed.<note n="82" xml:id="d510fn82">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>As the Department will note from the letter of Mr. Ovey, dated July 30 to
                            Dr. Kornfeld,<note n="82" xml:id="d510fn83">Not printed.</note> he
                            stated that Mr. MacDonald “has given me discretion to postpone, for a
                            short time, my communication to the Persian Government in order that I
                            may, if possible, have the benefit of your support. I should therefore
                            be most grateful if you would be so good as to inform me whether you
                            have received any instructions from Washington in that sense.”</p>
                        <p>I understand that Dr. Kornfeld verbally informed Mr. Ovey, in the spirit
                            of the Department’s telegram No. 65 of August 13, 4 p.m. that he was
                            unable, pending the settlement of the Imbrie case, to take up this
                            matter. Hence the British communication, originally dated, as will be
                            seen, July 30, was finally delivered on August 15 to the Persian
                            Government. I am informed that no reply has, until now, been received to
                            this communication.</p>

                                to assure the success of this enterprise. You will, however, agree
                                with me in the fact that the particular circumstances existing in
                                Persia make it impossible to take final measures in this connection
                                without having first studied and considered those circumstances.</p>
                            <p>The Imperial Persian Government, despite its sincere desire to
                                restrict the production and commerce of opium, finds it,
                                unfortunately, <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0685"/>impracticable suddenly to place a prohibition on it without having
                                taken certain particular points into consideration, such as the
                                substitution of other products for the production of opium, and the
                                adoption of an appropriate decision whereby the domestic consumption
                                of opium could gradually be stopped.</p>
                            <p>This view of the Persian Government has duly been stated to the
                                special branch of the League which is attended by the
                                representatives of the United States Government, and it is reported
                                that the American representatives have realized the difficulties
                                confronting the Persian Government and concur with the Persian
                                representatives in that, in order to bring about the complete
                                enforcement in Persia of the Hague Agreement, it is necessary that
                                practical methods of so doing should be resorted to.</p>
                            <p>I beg to reiterate the statement that my Government is exceedingly
                                desirous of being able, with the concurrence of your Government and
                                the other Governments, to remove the existing difficulties and
                                gradually to fulfill the provisions of The Hague Convention and the
                                decisions adopted by the League of Nations. Definite instructions
                                have been given to the Persian representatives who will attend the
                                commission that is to meet in Geneva in the coming month of
                                November, and I am hopeful that the views of the Persian Government
                                in the matter of the method of placing restriction on the production
                                and trade of opium will be accepted.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime I beg to request you to use the good offices of your
                                Honorable Legation in assuring your Government of the goodwill of
                                the Persian Government in this matter, and to request it to lend its
                                assistance and cooperation to the representatives of the Persian
                                Government in their just representations in order to find a
                                practical means of settling this affair.</p>
                            <p>I avail [etc.]</p>

                                received with high appreciation of Your Excellency’s courtesy, and I
                                ask you to be so good as to accept my cordial thanks therefor.</p>
                            <p>It would give me much pleasure, indeed, could I by a visit to your
                                country on the occasion mentioned be an eyewitness of the great

                                people of Peru, for whom I entertain the most cordial good will.
                                This pleasure, I regret to say, must be denied me, especially since
                                the festivities will occur at the same time as the opening days of
                                the next session of the Congress of the United States, when my
                                presence in Washington will be imperative. I shall, however, in

                                and to Your Excellency I offer my congratulations on the prosperity
                                and happiness enjoyed by the Peruvian nation, and my best wishes
                                that the years to come may have in store for your country a still

                                    may be said that the liberty of the Ibero-American nations was
                                    consolidated through the capitulation of the Spanish forces.</p>
                                <p>To make these ceremonies as brilliant as possible, the Peruvian
                                    Government has invited the Chiefs of State of the American
                                    countries to attend personally or by the representation of
                                    Embassies Extraordinary.</p>

                                    the Peruvian Government has received news in the sense that in
                                    Colombia and Bolivia the trip of the First Magistrate is being
                                    studied. It is possible that the same hope may be entertained
                                    with regard to Ecuador.</p>
                                <p>From the other countries, Embassies alone are expected, it being
                                    possible that the First Vice President, son of General Gomez,
                                    will come from Venezuela and that from Argentine and Brazil,
                                    Messrs. Gallardo and Pacheco, the respective Ministers for
                                    Foreign Affairs will attend. From both countries warships will
                                    come.</p>
                                <p>The invitation to European and Asiatic countries has been
                                    recently extended, favorable news being received at the Ministry
                                    regarding the possibility that France, Switzerland, Italy, and
                                    Great Britain will be officially represented by Delegates

                        <p>60. British Legation has shown me copy of their note of November 10th to
                            Foreign Office protesting against anticipated provision of the proposed
                            mining law, information based on semi-official statements and
                            intimations appearing in press.</p>
                        <p>I understand that French, Belgian and Dutch will probably protest also.
                            Anticipated provisions objectionable to foreign oil interests are: (1)
                            definite pursuance of policy since January, 1922, of refusal to approve
                            bona fide leases of oil lands; (2) state monopoly to sell petroleum
                            products; (3) requirement that majority of capital, shares and directors
                            be Roumanian; (4) confiscation, on pretext of being undeveloped, of
                            acquired rights to oil lands held in reserve by big companies but not as
                            yet drilled.</p>

                        <p>44. Legation’s telegram 60 of November 13, 3 p.m. In the absence of more
                            definite information it is difficult for the Department to give detailed
                            instructions. It is appreciated, however, that you may find such
                            information available only when the proposed mining legislation is
                            definitely drafted and that action may be desirable to meet the
                            situation before it is too late. You should, therefore, make an
                            appropriate protest if a mining bill with the objectionable provisions
                            outlined in points 1 and 4 of your 60, November 13, 3 p.m., is being or
                            should be seriously considered, as measures of the nature described
                            would appear to be such as would seriously <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0692"/>prejudice existing American rights and interests. It is
                            not clear that a protest would be justified respecting points 2 and 3
                            unless the monopoly proposed under point 2 should lead to measures which
                            might have a tendency toward confiscation.</p>
                        <p>Report further information as to proposed mining legislation as promptly
                            as possible.</p>

                            together with the references mentioned in regard to the Mexican
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon the Legation discussed with the British the opportuneness and
                            desirability of an immediate American protest to the Foreign Office on
                            this matter. It was learned that the British Note had apparently made
                            quite an impression upon the Rumanian Government, and that the Minister
                            of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Tancrede Constantinesco, had spoken in a
                            very reassuring manner to the British about the terms of the projected
                            new mining law. It was <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0693"/>thought
                            by my British Colleague that it was not immediately necessary or
                            desirable that the American Legation make a precautionary protest, until
                            more information could be obtained as to the latest attitude of the
                            Government, on the question of the new mining law. Up to the present
                            moment the Legation has been unable to ascertain anything definite as to
                            the projects of the Rumanian Government on this matter.</p>
                        <p>If the Legation receives information which would indicate the utility and
                            desirability of an immediate protest against threatened measures of a
                            nature serious enough to prejudice existing rights and interests of
                            United States citizens, it will make promptly a protest in conformity
                            with the full tenor of the Department’s Instructions in its telegram No.
                            44, reporting the action taken as well as the information upon which it
                            may be based.</p>
                        <p>It is perhaps needless to mention that the Legation is keeping in
                            constant touch with the representatives of the American oil interests in
                            Rumania, and is prepared always to consider, and if proper, to act upon
                            any suggestions they may make.</p>

                            Legation’s Despatches No. 522 of January 18, 1924,<note n="4" xml:id="d520fn4">Not printed.</note> No. 495 of December 10, 1923,
                            and to the Department’s telegram No. 44 of November 22, 1923, concerning
                            the proposed Rumanian Mining Law.</p>
                        <p>A translation of the draft of the new mining law, which is understood to
                            have been prepared by the present Government, was presented to me March
                            26th by the acting head of the Romano-Americana Company, Mr. Woltman;
                            together with a summary of certain of the most objectionable provisions
                            of the law. As the draft of the law fills 97 typewritten sheets, single
                            spaced, it has been impracticable to have it copied at the Legation,
                            therefore only the copy furnished by Mr. Woltman is herewith enclosed
                            (Enclosure No. 1).<note n="4" xml:id="d520fn5">Not printed.</note> There
                            are being sent forward, in quintuplicate, the extracts of the clauses
                            considered objectionable, covering 13 pages (Enclosure No. 2),<note n="4" xml:id="d520fn6">Not printed.</note> also a summary of the
                            case against the proposed law (Enclosure No. 3),<note n="4" xml:id="d520fn7">Not printed.</note> prepared and copied for the
                            Legation by the Romano-Americana Company.</p>
                        <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0694"/>
                        <p>On the receipt of these communications I was informed that the passage of
                            the law had been scheduled by the Rumanian Government for the middle of
                            April, and that grave anxiety was felt by the American Oil interests
                            over this prospect. I immediately consulted with my British, French, and
                            Netherlands Colleagues, whose respective countries represent the
                            principal foreign oil interests in Rumania. The British Minister, who
                            did not appear to be very conversant with the specific terms of the
                            draft, told me that, from what he knew of the proposed law, he saw no
                            serious grounds for protest. The French Minister, however, had studied
                            an earlier draft of the law, of which he had transmitted a copy to his
                            Government, and he was awaiting instructions on the matter. He agreed
                            with me that some of the provisions of the proposed law were intolerable
                            for foreign interests and hoped that he would soon be authorized to make
                            vigorous representations against the law in its present form. The Chargé
                            d’Affaires of the Netherlands made about the same statement.</p>
                        <p>In view of the Department’s telegram No. 44 of November 22, 1923, 4 P.M.,
                            I have deemed it advisable to present to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs a Note expressing the serious apprehensions felt by American
                            petroleum producers in Rumania as to the possible enactment of the law
                            as it now stands, particularly because of certain provisions. …</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: My attention has just
                                been called to a draft of a mining law recently made public and
                                reported to have been prepared by the Rumanian Government with a
                                view to its early enactment.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as certain provisions of the proposed law would, if enacted
                                and enforced, seem to me to furnish grounds for serious apprehension
                                on account of the American interests affected, I take the liberty of
                                bringing to Your Excellency’s personal knowledge, in this somewhat
                                informal manner, the grave anxiety felt by American petroleum
                                producers in Rumania in regard to this matter. I may add that I feel
                                this anxiety would be shared equally by my Government if it learned
                                that the Rumanian Government had the intention of applying to
                                American Petroleum Companies some of the measures contained in the
                                draft of the mining law to which I have the honor to refer
                                herein.</p>
                            <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0695"/>
                            <p>Of these provisions I shall only mention two which appear
                                particularly susceptible to well founded objections. The first is
                                that which requires foreign petroleum companies operating in
                                Rumania, in order to obtain new oil lands, to convert, within a
                                period of five years, all their capital stock into nominative
                                shares, 60% of which must be owned and controlled by Rumanian
                                subjects. As the proposed law makes no provision for the payment of
                                adequate compensation for the 60% or more of stock in American oil
                                companies operating in Rumania thus to be assigned to Rumanian
                                nationals, it is not clear how such American Companies, complying
                                with this law, as their continued existence would necessitate, would
                                be guaranteed against the confiscation of their property without due
                                compensation.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I deem it pertinent to remark that, while American
                                oil companies, which have been operating in Rumania for over 20
                                years under charters and in accordance with the laws, have
                                understood from their inception that they were subject to such
                                Governmental regulation, control, and taxation as the Rumanian State
                                might see fit to impose, it has never been understood that companies
                                once authorized by law to incorporate and do business in a foreign
                                country under American ownership would be subjected to the
                                alienation of any part of their property through an act of the
                                State, except by way of reasonable taxation, or by due process of
                                law and on the basis of adequate compensation being paid.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, I learn that rights to oil producing properties already
                                acquired by foreign companies must, under the proposed law, be
                                submitted to the appropriate authorities for registration and
                                validation. It is, obviously, a proper exercise of Governmental
                                control to require the registration of the acquisition of rights to
                                oil bearing lands, but it seems appropriate to add in this
                                connection that it has been understood that property rights acquired
                                in good faith and due legal form by American citizens would always
                                be respected by the Rumanian Government. It would seem, therefore,
                                that where good title to, and possession of, oil rights have been
                                legally acquired by American Companies and duly registered, the
                                question of present and future ownership thereof, should, subject to
                                the provisions only of laws in force at the time such rights were
                                obtained, be considered <hi rend="italic">res adjudicata.</hi></p>
                            <p>I refrain from pointing out many other provisions in the draft of the
                                proposed law, of a highly technical and complicated character, which
                                seem manifestly discriminatory and unsatisfactory.</p>
                            <p>In bringing to Your Excellency’s attention the foregoing
                                considerations I take occasion to express the hope that it is not
                                the intention of the Rumanian Government to pass any legislation of
                                the character just described or otherwise of such a nature as to
                                impair legitimate property rights and interests of American citizens
                                in Rumania.</p>

                            No. 582 of March 29th in regard to the proposed Rumanian Mining Law. I
                            enclosed therein a copy of a communication I thought it well to address
                            to the Minister for Foreign Affairs upon the subject, although I had
                            just learned it had been decided to postpone the presentation of the law
                            to Parliament until the autumn session.</p>
                        <p>I now have the honor to enclose a copy and translation of a short formal

                            and that any discussion of the matter was therefore premature, etc.,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the proposed mining law now
                            pending in the Roumanian Parliament, of which we understand the
                            Department has a copy, the security of the investment of this Company in
                            the Romano-Americana is threatened with confiscation, and our Roumanian
                            subsidiary, of which this Company owns 100% stock interest, is even
                            faced with forced liquidation after expiration of leases now owned,
                            unless 60% therein is sold to Roumanian nationals within five years from
                            the enactment of the proposed bill.</p>
                        <p>The provisions to which we beg to call the attention of the Department
                            are the following: <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0697"/>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Articles 35 and 36. These articles provide that leases will be
                                    granted only to Roumanian citizens, or Roumanian companies, of
                                    which at least 60% of the capital is owned by Roumanian
                                    nationals, and also of which the control and administration lie
                                    in the hands of Roumanian subjects. Since the adoption of the
                                    Roumanian Constitution of 1923, the subsoil has become the
                                    property of the State and no lease, or extension of existing oil
                                    leases, can be obtained except from the Roumanian Government.
                                    Therefore, at the expiration of our existing leases, which are
                                    generally of relatively short duration, the Romano-Americana
                                    will be forced to liquidation with the resultant sacrifice in
                                    values.</item>

                                <item>Articles 255 <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>. Rights acquired
                                    prior to the effective date of the new Roumanian Constitution
                                    are protected only if the owners file application for validation
                                    within one year, and the burden of proof in establishing these
                                    rights is thrown on the applicant. This provides that the rights
                                    must have been acquired in strict conformity with the previous
                                    laws or decrees and regulations, all working obligations must
                                    have been entirely met, and that the rights claimed are not in
                                    any way in conflict with the rights of the State. These articles
                                    are of the greatest importance in respect to the validation of
                                    leases of the Romano-Americana referred to fully in our letter
                                    to the Department of January 8, 1923.<note n="7" xml:id="d522fn7">Not printed.</note> We beg to emphasize
                                    that the Romano-Americana might be unable, under these articles,
                                    to establish valid acquired rights in those leases and
                                    extensions of leases upon which it was unable to obtain
                                    validation, as required by the Roumanian law, because the
                                    Roumanian Government had discontinued the office of registration
                                    after January 1922.</item>

                                    reserved for the State, and that existing pipe lines may be
                                    expropriated by the State. No provision, however, is made for
                                    compensation to the owners of expropriated pipe lines. The
                                    Romano-Americana has now restored, and has in operation, about
                                    seventy-five miles of pipe lines which would be thus
                                    affected.</item>

                                    raise a serious question as to the possibility of carrying
                                    leases in reserve for future operation, and even imperil the
                                    holding of some leases already acquired but not actually drilled

                                    the distribution of products in domestic trade in Roumania by an
                                    association administered by Roumanians. This arrangement would

                            proposed mining law, and to co-operate in that respect with the local
                            management of the Romano-Americana.</p>

                        <p>18. Your 15, May 24, 6 p.m. The Government has decided to present to
                            Parliament and presumably to rush through the mining bill at once
                            instead of during the fall session, in this way, if possible,
                            forestalling concerted foreign action. This move was contrary to the
                            general belief which apparently was officially inspired.</p>
                        <p>My British colleague and I did not receive this definite information
                            until May 25. Yesterday the British Minister telegraphed for
                            instructions. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has just returned from
                            foreign tour with the King. Today I conferred at length with the
                            Minister and impressed my views upon him with greatest energy, telling
                            him that I understood that those views were shared by the
                            representatives here of other countries having oil interests. He assured
                            me that objectionable features are removed from the bill as now drafted
                            and also that it would [not?] be rushed through Parliament without
                            debate. It is doubtful in my mind whether either of these assertions is
                            correct. So far, however, my British colleague and I have not been able
                            to obtain a copy of the law.</p>
                        <p>The presentation of the bill at this time took my interested colleagues
                            completely by surprise as they anticipated no action until fall. For
                            that reason the only protest made is my note of March 29.<note n="8" xml:id="d524fn8"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_600">p. 600</ref>.</note> Unofficially I am trying to have my
                            colleagues immediately offer oral protests without waiting for
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>I agree with the local representative of the Standard Oil Company that
                            the effect of the law as originally contemplated would be almost
                            disastrous. I recommend that if it is practicable other powers be
                            approached in an effort to secure identic action here immediately.</p>

                        <p>19. Mining bill is before Parliament now. I have received copies of new
                            draft from Minister of Foreign Affairs, but oil interests find <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0700"/>it just as unsatisfactory as
                            previous draft. The Legation likewise considers the bill still very
                            unsatisfactory, the changes appearing to be unimportant.</p>

                        <p>21. I will mail new draft of mining bill June 8. I have consulted with
                            representatives of Standard Oil Company and find that the only
                            fundamental changes are that the time for nationalization is extended
                            from five to ten years and that pipe lines taken are to be paid for.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday my British colleague made a written protest. The Belgian, Dutch
                            and French representatives are to make written protest tomorrow. I plan
                            to make an additional and detailed protest on the basis of your telegram
                            16 of May 31<note n="9" xml:id="d526fn9">Not printed; it contained the
                                following instructions (paraphrased): “Should it become necessary

                                protest, you should call attention to objectionable and confiscatory
                                clauses, certain of which are mentioned above, but refrain from
                                offering written suggestions as to modifications.” (File no.

                                nationalization from 5 years to 10 years; article number 202
                                provides compensation for pipe lines expropriated; article number
                                207 gives right of exploiting for gas to the Rumanian Government
                                alone or to the Rumanian Government with the cooperation of private
                                capital according to the provisions of the commercial law. This will

                                attention the anxiety felt by the Legation in respect to certain
                                provisions of a draft of a mining law, the enactment of which the
                                Rumanian Government was understood to have in view.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency was good enough recently to furnish me with copies of
                                the new draft<note n="13" xml:id="d528fn13">Not printed.</note>
                                which has now been submitted by the Royal Government to Parliament
                                and to inform me verbally of your conviction <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0702"/>that the modifications therein
                                introduced will have removed the grounds for the Legation’s
                                apprehensions.</p>
                            <p>My Government has made a careful study of the draft of the proposed
                                mining law, including the latest modifications, with special
                                reference to its effects on American interests, and I am authorized
                                to communicate to Your Excellency their views on this subject.</p>
                            <p>While in no way desirous of intervening in matters of Rumanian
                                domestic legislation, the Legation deems it proper, under its
                                instructions, to point out in a friendly spirit certain articles of
                                the proposed law which seem to furnish grounds for just concern.
                                Article 33 (formerly 36), although apparently now modified so as to
                                postpone the enforced nationalization of foreign owned petroleum
                                companies in Rumania from five to ten years, still does not seem to
                                provide for foreign interests so affected adequate assurance against
                                virtual confiscation as a result of the application of this measure.
                                Moreover, Articles Nos. 237 and 241 provide for the review by the
                                courts of leases of oil lands, but do not appear to establish any
                                satisfactory principles guaranteeing the respect of rights already
                                acquired. Furthermore, according to Article 99, the confirmation of
                                such rights is made contingent on the confiscation of the plant,
                                without due compensation in all cases, on the termination of the
                                lease.</p>
                            <p>Article No. 195 providing for the acquisition by the State of pipe
                                lines and depriving private companies of this branch of exploitation
                                in connection with their enterprises, also Article 81 imposing on
                                foreign owned companies, forcibly nationalized, a régime of 75% of
                                Rumanian officials and employees who will, necessarily, not
                                represent the capital invested in the companies,—give rise to
                                serious apprehension as to the possibility of foreign capitalists
                                continuing in the future, under the proposed system, profitably to
                                operate the plants which their funds and initiative have created and
                                developed.</p>
                            <p>I may go so far [as?] to say that the American petroleum operators in
                                Rumania inform me that they fear that the proposed legislation, if
                                strictly enforced, would ultimately force out of existence, with
                                heavy financial loss, because of the foregoing and other similar
                                provisions, all foreign owned petroleum companies now operating in
                                the country. Such a consequence, aside from any question of equity,
                                would scarcely seem to be in keeping with the assurances given by
                                the Rumanian Government on various occasions in the past when it has
                                encouraged, and even solicited, the investment of foreign capital in
                                the founding and promotion of industrial enterprises in this
                                country.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatch No. 618 of June
                            9, 1924, the Department’s telegram No. 17 of June 25th, 2 P.M.,<note n="14" xml:id="d530fn14">Not printed.</note> and my telegrams No. 25
                            of June 27th 5 P.M.<note n="14" xml:id="d530fn19">Not printed.</note>
                            and No. 27 of June 29th 9 P.M. on the Mining Law, I have the honor to
                            report the final enactment of this measure and the fruitless efforts of
                            the American, British and French Legations to obtain certain
                            modifications thereto.</p>
                        <p>In view of the innumerable indications that the law was about to be voted
                            by Parliament, after informal conversations with my British and French
                            Colleagues, we decided to make individually on June 21st verbal
                            representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I enclose herewith
                            (Enclosure No. 1) a copy of the brief memorandum which I read to Mr.
                            Duca that evening, leaving with him the text thereof.<note n="14" xml:id="d530fn20">Not printed.</note> It will be recalled that this
                            Legation had presented two notes of remonstrance previous to this
                                one.<note n="15" xml:id="d530fn15"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_600">pp. 600</ref> and <ref target="#pg_607">607</ref>.</note> In this memorandum I pointed out the
                            unfortunate consequences to be foreseen for the economic future of
                            Rumania if a measure so disastrous to foreign interests were to be
                            enacted. I also called attention to the inexactness of the contention
                            often made by the present Rumanian Government to the effect that the
                            legislatures of other countries have treated foreign petroleum interests
                            in a manner similar to that envisaged by this law.</p>
                        <p>On June 24th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed simultaneously
                            identic notes (Enclosure No. 2)<note n="16" xml:id="d530fn16">Printed
                                    <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> as enclosure 1.</note> to the
                            British, French and American Legations replying to our several
                            representations concerning the mining law. …</p>
                        <p>The day following the receipt of this communication from the Rumanian
                            Government, the British Minister, Sir Herbert Dering, <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0704"/>addressed a note to Mr. Duca, of which
                            he furnished me a copy (Enclosure No. 3)<note n="17" xml:id="d530fn17">Not printed.</note>. … The note renews the remonstrances previously
                            made by the British Government on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Feeling that it might be useful for me also to refute certain of the
                            erroneous statements propounded by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I
                            addressed on June 26, 1924, a third written note (Enclosure No. 4)<note n="18" xml:id="d530fn18">Printed <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> as
                                enclosure 2.</note> to the Foreign Office on the Mining Law. …</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The chronology of the passage of the Mining Law through the legislative
                            bodies is, briefly, as follows: the bill was brought before the Senate
                            June 17th, and passed by that body June 18th, after eight and a half
                            hours discussion. It was introduced in the Chamber on the 23rd and voted
                            on the 26th, after twelve and a half hours discussion; and was finally
                            approved by the Senate on June 28th without discussion. It is about to
                            be signed by the King and promulgated in the <hi rend="italic">Official
                                Monitor.</hi></p>
                        <p>Certain slight modifications have been made to the bill during the final
                            passage through the Chambers which I hope to report in a memorandum by
                            this pouch.<note n="17" xml:id="d530fn21">Not printed.</note> A complete
                            resume, prepared by the officials of the Romano-Americana, of the
                            unsatisfactory provisions contained in this law will form a part of this
                            memorandum. The outstanding objection to the law, as previously reported
                            to the Department, is based on the requirement that foreign owned
                            companies, in order to acquire new lands, must become “nationalized” on
                            the basis of 55% of the shares and direction being in the hands of
                            Rumanian subjects.</p>
                        <p>This Legation was the first and the last to lodge a protest against the
                            Mining Law and my representations on this subject have certainly
                            exceeded in number and vigor those of my British and French Colleagues.
                            I may add that practically every step recommended by our oil interests
                            in this country as being of possible utility has been energetically
                            taken by the Legation. It is therefore with confidence that I state that
                            this Legation has done everything reasonably and properly within its
                            power to protect American interests in connection with the passage of
                            this law.</p>
                        <p>The law has been one of the most cherished policies of Mr. Vintila
                            Bratiano, Minister of Finance and brother of the Prime Minister. …</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: In reply to your written and
                                verbal interventions concerning the Mining Law, I have the honor to
                                communicate to you the following:</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that considerable amounts belonging to your
                                nationals are invested in our petroleum industry, we have found it
                                quite natural that you should intervene for their protection and, in
                                consequence, we have examined all your requests in the most friendly
                                spirit.</p>
                            <p>In the first place, we have considered that your wish to assure the
                                respect of the rights acquired was justified, and by the provisions
                                as well as by the modifications made subsequently to the draft of
                                the law, complete satisfaction has been given to your just
                                concern.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Per contra</hi>, we have not considered well
                                founded the demands relative to Article 33. In fact, in all mining
                                legislation we have been guided only by the wish to give to that
                                question, and in particular to that of petroleum, which plays, from
                                day to day, a more important role in the entire world, solutions
                                which accord with our economic interests and our national
                                defense.</p>
                            <p>It is this anxiety which has led us, in so far as future oil
                                development is concerned, to adopt formulas of collaboration between
                                Rumanian and foreign capital,—formulas which, besides, are much less
                                radical than those adopted by certain foreign legislations, notably
                                that of the British.</p>
                            <p>The accusation that these solutions hinder the development of the
                                existing companies, seems to us without foundation. In fact, these
                                Companies exploit today scarcely 3500 hectares of 25,000 hectares
                                which they possess and which the new legislation does not affect.
                                If, aside from these already considerable areas, they desire to
                                acquire new lands, to require of them a collaboration with Rumanian
                                capital and initiative does not seem to us an exaggerated demand nor
                                even an innovation.</p>
                            <p>It is for that reason we are convinced that a thorough examination of
                                the draft of law as it is presented today will prove to you that it
                                gives satisfaction to the legitimate preoccupations of your
                                nationals and that it does not justify the criticism which it has
                                provoked in certain circles.</p>
                            <p>Be pleased [etc.]</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to
                                acknowledge the receipt of Note No. 32995 of June 24, 1924, in which
                                Your Excellency was good enough to communicate to me the reply of
                                the Royal Government to the verbal and written representations of
                                this Legation in respect of the proposed mining law for Rumania.</p>
                            <p>The considerate tone of your Note under acknowledgment confirms my
                                confident belief that Your Excellency is constantly animated by a
                                sincere desire to promote, in so far as it lies within your power,
                                relations of cordiality and mutual helpfulness between our two
                                countries. This belief inspires me with the hope that it will not be
                                entirely in vain that I call attention in this communication to
                                certain arguments advanced in Your Excellency’s Note, which appear
                                to be based on an incomplete knowledge of the facts.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the data which Your Excellency was pleased to submit
                                on the extent of the areas at present under exploitation and held in
                                reserve by foreign oil companies operating in Rumania, I desire to
                                point out that the Romano-Americana Company is now exploiting less
                                than 1000 hectares of oil producing land, which, at the present rate
                                of production, will be exhausted, according to the most conservative
                                estimate, in a period of eight to ten years. Moreover, I am informed
                                that nine-tenths of the undeveloped lands held under lease by this
                                Company are known to be without oil producing potentialities.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency, in referring to the concern felt by my Government as
                                to the proposed nationalization of the foreign owned petroleum
                                companies in Rumania, took occasion to express the opinion that the
                                proposed legislation is much less radical than that adopted by
                                certain foreign Governments, notably that of Great Britain. This
                                assertion is doubtless founded on inadequate or inexact information
                                as to the laws at present in force in the British Empire. As a
                                matter of fact, American companies, a majority of whose shares are
                                held by American citizens, are actually carrying on freely all forms
                                of oil business in various parts of the British Empire. In Canada,
                                for instance, the American Standard Oil Company of New Jersey mines
                                petroleum and distributes products thereof throughout that Dominion.
                                American companies also market their petroleum products in Great
                                Britain and other parts of the British Empire in competition with
                                native industries.</p>
                            <p>I believe myself well advised in declaring that the proposed Mining
                                Law, if enforced, would establish a regime more prejudicial <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0707"/>to American petroleum
                                interests than exists in any other important country of the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>At the close of the late world war, when the question of recommencing
                                operations in Rumania presented itself to the Direction of the
                                Romano-Americana Company, Mr. E. J. Sadler, on their behalf, in a
                                letter No. 1810, addressed under date of May 1, 1919, to the
                                Ministry of Industry and Commerce, solicited certain assurances of
                                the Rumanian Government. In the final paragraph of this letter he
                                asked particularly if the Company might know whether “in making new
                                and important investments” it would be possible for them to
                                “recommence and continue as in the past the business of the
                                Company”. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied to this
                                letter in an official and formal Note No. 5177 under date of May 9,
                                1919, in which it was stated that the Romano-Americana Company might
                                “resume its former activities with full confidence in the spirit of
                                equity which the Rumanian Government has invariably shown in the
                                past”. I might mention that this communication was countersigned by
                                Mr. Tancrede Constantinesco, today a member of the present
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>I cite this communication in corroboration of the statement I made in
                                our last interview on the Mining Law to the effect that American
                                capital had been invested in Rumania on the invitation of the Royal
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>These assurances, given over five years ago, were taken by the oil
                                interests of my country, and it would appear reasonably so, to
                                indicate that American investors might expect for their investments
                                in Rumania a regime equally favorable to that which they had enjoyed
                                here in the past. Nor was it, indeed, fairly to be anticipated, in
                                the light of these assurances, that the Rumanian Government would at
                                this, or some later date, inaugurate a mining policy, which, as I
                                have shown above, is, in the entire world, exceptional because of
                                its features detrimental to foreign investors.</p>

                        <p>19. Legation’s telegram 27 of June 29. The Department is concerned at the
                            passage of the mining law on account of the possibility apparently
                            offered by this law for the Rumanian authorities to take a course of
                            action by which legitimate American interests would be adversely
                            affected. This law, furthermore, is only the latest of a series of
                            measures which the Rumanian Government has <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0708"/>taken during the past two years tending to give the
                            impression that Rumania is not willing to treat American interests as
                            those interests might naturally expect to be treated by Rumanian
                            authorities. A lack of desire on the part of the Rumanian Government for
                            the improvement of its existing relations with the United States is
                            shown not only by the passage of the mining law but also by the attitude
                            of the Rumanian Debt Funding Commission to the United States, the
                            Consolidation Loan program,<note n="20" xml:id="d531fn20">A program for
                                the consolidation of debts owed by the Rumanian Government to
                                private foreign interests under the provisions of a law passed in
                                June 1922. The United States objected because of priorities which
                                were considered in conflict with pledges given regarding the
                                Rumanian debt to the American Government, and because of objections

                            International Harvester, and other American companies.</p>
                        <p>Because of the situation outlined above the Department is considering
                            asking you to return to the United States for consultation. This action
                            is contemplated with a view to adopting a policy calculated to improve
                            this situation as well as to call the attention of the Rumanian
                            officials clearly to the concern with which our Government views recent
                            developments. If you are instructed to return to this country you would
                            be authorized to make clear to your colleagues and to the Rumanian
                            Government that you were returning for consultation regarding the
                            unsatisfactory attitude shown toward our nationals and their interests
                            by the Rumanian Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department wishes a telegraphic report of your views regarding the
                            proposed action; you will then be given further instructions.</p>

                        <p>29. Your 19, July 3, 4 p.m. The increasing weakness of its credit abroad,
                            as indicated by the recent fall of exchange, seems to have impressed the
                            Rumanian Government, and the Minister of Commerce has tried to allay the
                            fears of the foreign oil interests by informing them that the Rumanian
                            authorities will not be unreasonable in enforcing the mining laws and
                            has sought to comfort them in other ways. Apparently the Rumanian
                            Government is trying to combat unfavorable reaction abroad and violent
                            criticism within the country <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0709"/>against this final act in the antiforeign policy of the Minister of
                            Finance.</p>
                        <p>I believe, therefore, that the action contemplated by the Department
                            would be a severe shock to the Liberal Government and would come at a
                            particularly embarrassing time.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that I be authorized to have a frank talk with the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs in which I would tell him that the general attitude
                            of the Rumanian Government was viewed by my Government with so much
                            concern that I had been instructed to return to Washington for
                            consultation and that I had been directed to make public the reason why
                            I was leaving. If the Minister of Foreign Affairs should offer serious
                            propositions I would tell him that acting on my own responsibility I
                            would transmit them to my Government and delay my departure until I
                            received further instructions. I also recommend that if you approve this
                            course you notify the Rumanian Minister at Washington …</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs, unfortunately, leaves the day after
                            tomorrow for Prague to attend the semi-annual conference of the Little
                            Entente and will probably be away for ten days. As Parliament has
                            adjourned, the Prime Minister is temporarily in the country, but
                            presumably I could see him. I would rather have the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs present, however, as he has a lively appreciation of and respect
                            for the power and influence of the United States in the world and has
                            before this given impression of trying to support American interests
                            against Vintila Bratiano. I desire finally to remove any impression I
                            may possibly have given that American interests here already received
                            [worse?] treatment than others. All the foreign representatives here and
                            their nationals are making bitter complaints. In some cases, however,
                            their governments, notably the French, hesitate to take extreme
                            measures, presumably for purely political reasons.</p>

                            but semi-officially denied a report that my alleged recall was due to
                            severe tone of my recent protests.</p>
                        <p>Feeling however Foreign Office would soon apply to me for information I
                            addressed Friday July 11th short note to Under Secretary stating that I
                            desired to make highly important communication of my own personally to
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister and requested
                            interview with them immediately after return of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs expected Thursday.</p>
                        <p>If not already done please at once impress upon Roumanian Legation that I
                            am carrying out your instructions.</p>

                        <p>27. Legation’s telegram 38 of July 13, 5 p.m. I saw Rumanian Minister
                            today and told him that in informing the Rumanian Government that you
                            had been directed to return here for consultation, in view of the
                            unsatisfactory treatment of American interests in Rumania, <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0711"/>you were acting on the Department’s
                            specific instructions. In my conversation with Prince Bibesco I did not
                            take up any of the various matters at issue in detail as I believed it
                            better that you should take up these questions first with responsible
                            officials at Bucharest. However, I left Prince Bibesco in no doubt by
                            what authority you were acting.</p>
                        <p>If you think it desirable the Department will take the matter up in more
                            detail with Prince Bibesco when it has received your telegraphic report
                            which should indicate the points stressed by you in conversation with
                            Rumanian officials.</p>
                        <p>Legation’s telegram 39 of July 13 just received. Your action approved.
                            Further reports from you on the situation are awaited with interest by

                        <p>43. Mining law was signed by the King July 3, promulgated July 4, when it
                            entered into effect.</p>
                        <p>Carefully made translation, hereinafter referred to, follows by mail.
                            Steaua Romano Company is apparently not exempted at the end of ten years
                            from nationalization requirements of article number 33. Article number
                            181, however, allows this company, inasmuch as it has 25 percent
                            Roumanian capital and is of “great importance,” to secure an additional
                            perimeter in each delimited oil-producing area. This Company alone of
                            predominantly foreign companies fulfills these conditions and thereby
                            profits from a discrimination.</p>
                        <p>This law is too complicated to report on adequately by telegram. Minister
                            of Industry and Commerce told delegation of foreign oil interests they
                            should not pay attention to letter of the law but rely on good will of
                            the Government, accepting the assurances of the authors of the measure
                            who alone were in a position to interpret it.</p>
                        <p>The Government would always allow a satisfactory <hi rend="italic">modus
                                operandi</hi> to be reached as difficulties might be encountered.
                            However, general impression is that it will only be possible to evade
                            the law successfully by employing the right intermediaries i. e. the
                            Liberal banks and lawyers.</p>

                            Department’s telegram No. 19 of July 3, 1924, 4 P.M., in regard to my
                            proceeding to Washington for consultation in connection with the
                            unsatisfactory attitude of the Rumanian Government. …</p>
                        <p>… The Minister for Foreign Affairs returned to Bucharest July 16th
                            following which we went to Sinaia on July 17th for a conference with the
                            King. A Council of Ministers was held the morning of July 18th and I was
                            received the same day at noon by Mr. Duca at the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>During this interview I presented a Note No. 73 dated July 10th, of which
                            a copy is herewith enclosed, wherein I stated that my Government had
                            instructed me to proceed to Washington for a consultation on the

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor to inform
                                Your Excellency that I have just received instructions from my
                                Government to proceed to the United States for the purpose of
                                consultation with the Department of State on the attitude of the
                                Rumanian Government towards American interests.</p>
                            <p>It is, at the same time, my duty to make known to Your Excellency the
                                considerations which have guided the Government of the United States
                                in arriving at the decision stated above. The recent passage of the
                                mining law, as I indicated to Your Excellency in a series of earnest
                                and renewed representations, has been a matter of grave concern to
                                my Government in view of the possibility which this law appears to
                                offer for a course of action on the part of the Rumanian <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0713"/>Government which would have a
                                detrimental effect on American interests. Moreover, this law is only
                                the most recent of a succession of measures taken by the Rumanian
                                Government during the past two years which cannot fail to give the
                                impression that the Rumanian Government is not prepared to accord to
                                American interests the treatment which those interests may
                                reasonably expect from the Rumanian authorities. Thus, the
                                commercial indebtedness law; the failure of the Rumanian Government
                                to satisfy the just claims of its American creditors, such as the
                                Baldwin Company; the Consolidation Loan programme; the attitude
                                assumed by the Rumanian Debt Funding Commission sent to the United
                                States; are not thought by my Government to give evidence of a
                                desire on the part of the Rumanian Government to improve existing
                                relations with the United States.</p>
                            <p>In consideration, therefore, of these just grounds for
                                dissatisfaction, and with a view to adopting a course of action
                                which may be susceptible of effecting a change for the better in
                                this situation, also with the further object of bringing clearly to
                                the attention of the Rumanian Government the concern with which
                                recent developments have been viewed by the Government of the United
                                States, it has been decided to summon me to Washington.</p>
                            <p>My Government directs me to make plain, not only to the Royal
                                Government, but also to my Colleagues, that my journey to the United
                                States has been ordered for the purpose of consultation in
                                connection with the unsatisfactory attitude of the Rumanian
                                Government towards American nationals and their interests. It is
                                furthermore the purpose of the Government of the United States that
                                due publicity shall be given to the reasons for my return.</p>

                            with the Department, in spite of the evidence given above that the
                            Rumanian Government is anxious to meet our views.</p>
                        <p>When signing Extradition Treaty July 23 I told the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs that I had sent a telegram to the Department in the above sense.
                            I added that I would be glad to present the case for Rumania also which
                            had been so earnestly stated by him in his memorandum and enclosures. I
                            also told him that in view of the conciliatory spirit shown by the
                            Rumanian Government I had ventured to recommend to the Department that
                            the publicity originally intended regarding my departure should not be
                            given.</p>
                        <p>With reference to suggestion by the Rumanian Minister to the United
                            States that my return to America be postponed for six weeks, the Finance
                            Minister has gone to France, officially for the purpose of taking a
                            cure; I learn from the British Minister, however, that he proposes to
                            visit Great Britain, with the intention, it is generally believed, of
                            making every effort to obtain a loan, even being prepared, it is said,
                            to offer the State oil lands as a guarantee. For this reason the
                            Rumanian Government may at this particular time be anxious to avoid
                            possible reaction in financial circles which might arise from publicity
                            regarding my return as originally intended and mentioned in the note
                            which I sent to the Foreign Office. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                            <p>The Rumanian Government has taken cognizance of the note of the
                                Government of the United States of America, and has the
                                consciousness of not having either by its intentions or by its
                                actions done anything contrary to “what American interests might
                                reasonably expect on the part of the Rumanian authorities.”</p>
                            <p>Moreover why should Rumania not have treated American interests with
                                the attention and in the friendly spirit which they deserved?</p>
                            <p>Rumania cannot forget that in the World War she was the ally of the
                                Great American Republic, nor can she forget the determining
                                influence which the intervention of the United States had on the
                                final victory permitting the Rumanian people to realize their
                                national unity. Likewise the Rumanian Government, anxious above all
                                else to insure the consolidation of Rumania thus increased in size
                                by the war, cannot ignore the fact that the United States represents
                                a factor of the highest importance in the general work of the
                                pacific and economic reconstruction of Europe.</p>
                            <p>Also we cannot dissemble our surprise at the intentions which we are
                                purported to cherish, and we can only attribute to incomplete or
                                erroneous information the decision taken by you to request your
                                Minister to return to the United States for a consultation with the
                                Department of State regarding the attitude of the Rumanian
                                Government towards American interests.</p>
                            <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0716"/>
                            <p>We are certain that a more complete and careful examination will not
                                fail to convince the Government of the United States that the
                                accusations made in the note of July 10, 1924,<note n="29a" xml:id="d539fn29a"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_618">p. 618</ref>.</note> are unjustified.</p>
                            <p>(1) Thus, the aforesaid note mentions in the first place the
                                Commercial Indebtedness Law.</p>
                            <p>The majority of these debts were contracted immediately after the
                                armistice at a time when the Rumanian exchange was still highly
                                advantageous; but as a result of its depreciation during the years
                                1919–1922, our business people encountered such difficulties that
                                the commercial life of the entire country was seriously threatened.
                                In view of this situation the creditors themselves—in their own
                                interest as well as in ours—proposed arrangements to scale, under
                                certain conditions, the payment of these debts.</p>
                            <p>The first initiative was taken following the intervention of the
                                British creditors, to whom our businessmen were most heavily
                                indebted. This example was then followed by other countries, and
                                arrangements were thus made with France, Switzerland, Italy and
                                Belgium. At the request of the British creditors the law was brought
                                in to sanction this state of affairs.</p>
                            <p>How can the Government of the United States see in this a measure
                                directed against American interests? It seems to us rather that our
                                businessmen could point out that the American creditors are the only
                                ones who up to date have been unwilling to make any arrangement
                                similar to those accepted by the other creditors. Although this is a
                                matter of relations between private persons, the Rumanian Government
                                has never refused, and in the future will always be ready to
                                intervene in order to facilitate a similar arrangement between
                                Rumanian debtors and American creditors.</p>
                            <p>(2) As regards the failure of the Rumanian Government to satisfy the
                                just claims of American creditors, we would in the first place point
                                out, speaking generally, that as a result of the war, of two years
                                of enemy occupation and of post-war difficulties from which the
                                whole of Europe has suffered so intensely, Rumania found herself
                                with a floating foreign debt of about one billion, 400 thousand gold
                                francs. In view of the depreciation of the exchange, the only
                                solution was the consolidation of that debt. The Government
                                proceeded thereto without delay.</p>
                            <p>The great majority of the bearers of these Treasury bonds accepted
                                the conditions of consolidation. Only the American creditors
                                refused.</p>
                            <p>As this proceeding is optional, we do not reproach them. It was their
                                right. We could merely point out that what Was considered <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0717"/>acceptable by 90% of our
                                creditors, only appeared unacceptable to American creditors.</p>
                            <p>At all events, having achieved the consolidation, the Rumanian
                                Government had also to consider the measures to be taken as regards
                                the holders of Treasury bonds who did not accept the
                                consolidation.</p>
                            <p>It was confronted by two American creditors: <list>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>The Baldwin Company;</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>The Transoceanic Corporation.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>After having offered the Baldwin Company more advantageous conditions
                                than other similar companies, we offered—animated precisely by our
                                desire to comply with the requests of the American
                                Government—exceptional conditions which prove our good faith and our
                                will to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties.</p>
                            <p>A. As regards the Transoceanic Corporation, one of its
                                representatives came this summer—as the American Legation knows—to
                                treat with the Ministry of Finance; he seemed satisfied with the
                                conditions offered him, and not having full powers, he returned to
                                the United States to obtain them.</p>
                            <p>We have therefore every reason to believe that an arrangement can be
                                concluded and at all events it seems to us that under these
                                conditions it is really not possible to attribute to the Rumanian
                                Government the intent to treat with disregard or voluntarily to
                                neglect American interests.</p>
                            <p>Again, if there were any reason for complaint, it seems to us that it
                                should be addressed rather to the American creditors, who were the
                                only ones refusing what the other creditors of the Rumanian State
                                did not hesitate to accept for much larger sums.</p>
                            <p>(3) The program of the consolidation of the Rumanian Treasury
                                bonds—as we already had the honor to point out to you in our notes
                                of the year 1922<note n="30" xml:id="d539fn30">Not
                                printed.</note>—was not directed against the interests of any state.
                                This consolidation was attempted by the only means at our disposal,
                                the improvement of our public finances and the reconstruction of our
                                economic life. In this way the consolidation undoubtedly placed
                                Rumania in a position to increase payments to all her creditors and
                                ensured for her the only way to meet her obligations—which in any
                                case she had never intended to evade. Hence the interests of the
                                United States, as creditors of Rumania, could not but be safeguarded
                                and strengthened by this policy and this program.</p>
                            <p>In the employment of export taxes as security for the payment of the
                                amortization and interests of this consolidation, the Government of
                                the United States has seen a disregard of the right of priority of
                                the debt owed it by the Rumanian Government.</p>

                            <p>We believe that the United States Government is in error.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the revenue from these taxes is not merely to be employed as
                                security for the consolidation only, but as security for the entire
                                public debt of the Rumanian State.</p>
                            <p>This was formally stipulated in the law.</p>
                            <p>More than this, it was arranged that if the export taxes should be
                                suppressed on all the revenues of the State, priority would be
                                accorded to the funds intended to guarantee the payment of the
                                entire foreign public debt, and that these funds would be deposited
                                in the National Bank. To this end a convention was signed with the
                                National Bank; we enclose herewith copy of this convention as well
                                as of the text of the law<note n="31" xml:id="d539fn31">Neither
                                    printed.</note> showing that the export taxes go to guarantee
                                our entire public debt and not merely the debt accruing from the
                                consolidation which is the subject of your complaint.</p>
                            <p>Thus here again we cannot see how American interests have been
                                detrimentally affected, nor in what the Rumanian Government has not
                                shown proof of its desire to improve existing relations with the
                                United States. Hence it cannot be anything but a
                                misunderstanding.</p>
                            <p>(4) Likewise as regards the attitude taken by the commission sent to
                                the United States to discuss the subsequent settlement of the
                                Rumanian Government’s debt to the American Government. During the
                                war, when we fought together and where our soldiers shed their blood
                                for the triumph of the same cause of justice and of civilization, we
                                were induced to contract in the United States a debt of
                                36,114,718.52 dollars.</p>
                            <p>Our Commission, which went to the United States in 1922, agreed with
                                the American Government on the exact amount of this debt, which we
                                never—we wish once again to state it clearly—dreamed of not
                                recognizing.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, our Commission had instructions to inform the American
                                Government that the Rumanian Government was also ready to subscribe
                                to any arrangement which might be made in regard to these debts with
                                all the other Allies.</p>
                            <p>We also enclose copy of the instructions issued to Mr. Eftimie
                                Antonesco, chief of our Mission to the United States in 1922,<note n="32" xml:id="d539fn32">Not printed.</note> which confirm these
                                statements and which show that we were not even at that time
                                reluctant to propose everything in our power.</p>
                            <p>(Enclosures A and B.)<note n="32" xml:id="d539fn34">Not

                            <p>What more could we do? Pay now? We never believed that the American
                                Government required that. We always believed that it did not intend
                                to apply to us a treatment different from that of the other
                                Allies—France, Italy, Belgium, Yugoslavia, etc.</p>
                            <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0719"/>
                            <p>Besides, taken together with the question of the reparations, this
                                question constitutes one of the great international problems of the
                                general liquidation of the World War.</p>
                            <p>Why should Rumania be subjected to exceptional treatment and in what
                                has she, by reason of her attitude, shown herself less mindful of
                                her obligations towards the United States than other countries
                                (excepting, of course, Great Britain)?</p>
                            <p>We have made a point of explaining in detail all the points
                                previously mentioned because we find them listed in your note; but
                                from its very tone we see that the question to which the Government
                                of the United States attaches the most importance, which constitutes
                                so to speak the principal object of its move, is the mining law,
                                recently voted by the Rumanian Parliament.</p>
                            <p>As regards this question, which is obviously of great importance to
                                Rumania, we desire to state at once and very clearly the point of
                                view of the Rumanian Government.</p>
                            <p>The Royal Government recognizes that in the petroleum industry, it is
                                part of its duty to accord the most ample and complete respect to
                                all vested rights, either of foreigners or of its own nationals. In
                                this sense—as it had the honor to inform the American Government by
                                its note of June 24, 1924<note n="33" xml:id="d539fn33"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_611">p.
                                    611</ref>.</note>—the Rumanian Government considered entirely
                                legitimate all the representations addressed to it to secure the
                                uncontested respect of those rights. It is moreover convinced that
                                as a result of the alterations which have been successively
                                introduced in the original draft, the mining law is now so drafted
                                as to afford no scope for justifiable criticism.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand the Rumanian Government considers that it alone has
                                the right to decide the future disposal of its petroleum lands. This
                                is an essential and legitimate attribute of its sovereignty, a right
                                which has never been contested and which in all justice could not be
                                contested.</p>
                            <p>The Rumanian Government could only be in the wrong as regards the
                                United States in one given circumstance, namely, if the new mining
                                law made special conditions for any other country to the detriment
                                of American interests.</p>
                            <p>Again in this matter, not only does the law not establish any
                                difference between the petroleum enterprises of the various
                                nationalities, but it allows all companies without distinction to
                                benefit by all its advantages under certain most acceptable
                                conditions, as is shown by their acceptance by the Franco-British,
                                British, French and Belgian companies.</p>
                            <p>As we have already stated above, the difficulties which Rumania had
                                to overcome after the war were especially serious.</p>
                            <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0720"/>
                            <p>By dint of unceasing effort, the Royal Government has the
                                satisfaction of recognizing that it has succeeded in overcoming most
                                of these difficulties. It has established order, undertaken the work
                                of unification and reorganization in all directions, balanced the
                                budget, consolidated floating debts, reestablished means of
                                transportation, stopped inflation and daily increasingly normalized
                                economic life, so that the commercial balance is now favorable.</p>
                            <p>This labor merited encouragement. Even the defeated nations—and
                                justly so—obtained it. In her work of reconstruction, Rumania had
                                herself and nobody but herself to count on. Even though she lacked
                                the material support of the United States, she thought at least that
                                she could count on its moral support and see her efforts understood
                                and appreciated by the great American democracy.</p>
                            <p>Thus we would wish to hope that the Government of the United
                                States—which has invariably manifested towards us a sympathy always
                                highly prized by us—will not adopt an attitude detrimental to
                                Rumania at the very moment when the support of America is more
                                necessary than ever to Europe and when the entire world is placing
                                in this support such legitimate hopes for the consolidation of peace
                                and the economic rehabilitation of the nations.</p>

                            7 p.m. Your paragraph 2. There appears no immediate prospect of further
                            action in Baldwin case pending arrival from America of company’s
                            representative. I firmly believe however present intention of Roumanian

                            realize importance attached by us to this question. Regarding

                            and that I will merely let it be known [that I am going?] home on leave
                            during which I will visit Washington. I added that I believe my presence
                            at Washington would be helpful in reaching a solution of many vexatious
                            questions provided the Roumanian Government continued to show the same
                            good will manifested in recent negotiations. Minister for Foreign

                            Affairs. During my conversation he read me part of a telegram dated
                            August 1st from Roumanian Minister at Washington reporting his latest
                            interview with Department and confirming above information your
                            paragraph 7. Minister for Foreign Affairs asked me to designate member
                            of Legation to meet Secretary General of the Minister of Finance
                            tomorrow to receive suggestions and propositions of Roumanian Government
                            for settlement of private debts. I am sending commercial attaché who has
                            been in correspondence with various American creditors and Secretary
                            Dennis who is leaving Bucharest Friday. Their report will be duly

                        <p>[Paraphrase.] It is my impression that the present Liberal Government
                            will not continue in power beyond this fall, due to the attitude of our

                        <p>62. The local head of the Romano-Americana Company called today at the
                            Legation, made a statement to me of which the following is the
                            substance.</p>
                        <p>The Romano-Americana Company holds certain parcels of land under
                            concessions dating from 1900 and validated in accordance with the
                            present mining law to continue until 1935 and 1949 respectively. The
                            company applied on July 30th, 1924, for permission to drill two wells on
                            these holdings and has now received a reply from the Minister of
                            Industry and Commerce stating that the drilling of these wells shall be
                            governed by the new mining regulations. This means, in accordance with a
                            decision given on the 9th instant by the ministerial committee for the
                            application of the new mining law, that no wells can be drilled on those
                            properties because, in accordance with the above-mentioned decision, no
                            wells can be drilled at a distance less than 30 meters from the boundary
                            of neighboring property. The concessions in question are so narrow that
                            no well can be drilled on them which will be 30 or more meters from the
                            boundary. In other words, these lands, although held under concession by
                            the company and exploitable under the old laws, cannot be exploited at
                            all and these two are the first applications acted upon under these
                            conditions since the passage of the mining law. This ruling establishes
                            a precedent which if maintained will seriously affect the company’s
                            exploitation of other concessions held by it under similar conditions.
                            The head of the company has lodged a formal protest with me today
                            against this ruling on the ground that it constitutes an insidious
                            violation of the acquired rights sanctioned by article 235 of the mining
                            district law and which the Roumanian Government has repeatedly and
                            publicly declared its intention of respecting.</p>

                            are affected and am forwarding by next pouch copy of Romano-Americana’s

                        <p>41. Your 62, September 24, 7 p.m. You should inform Rumanian Government,
                            in writing, that the Department is greatly surprised by the reported
                            decision of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce described in your
                            telegram. This decision if enforced will apparently render valueless
                            rights duly acquired under the law as it existed at the time of such
                            acquisition. You should add that in view of the repeated assurances that
                            all acquired rights would be left undisturbed, the Rumanian Government,
                            it is hoped, will not persist in the attitude apparently adopted in this
                            matter by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
                        <p>The Department is giving this whole subject of the Mining Law careful
                            consideration, and in your communication you should indicate that your
                            Government reserves the privilege of making such further communication
                            on this particular phase or on any other phases of the Mining Law as may
                            appear necessary.</p>

                        <p>64. Your 41, September 27 [<hi rend="italic">26</hi>], 4 p.m. Mr. Hughes,
                            head of the Romano-Americana, informed me yesterday that the Minister of
                            Industry and Commerce had summoned him for a conference this morning.
                            The Minister admitted at this conference that he had summoned Mr. Hughes
                            because of a telegram from the Rumanian Minister at Washington to the
                            Foreign Office reporting that the State Department was concerned at this
                            interpretation of the mining law. The following paragraph gives the
                            substance of a memorandum which Mr. Hughes handed me summarizing the
                            statement which the Minister made to him:</p>
                        <p>The Minister maintained that for concessions taken either before or after
                            the promulgation of the mining law on July 4, 1924, the provisions of
                            the law requiring that wells should be 30 meters from the <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0726"/>boundary should in principle remain in
                            effect. The Minister will, however, make a separate decision on each
                            application for the location of a well. He will take a broad view in his
                            decisions and will approve all applications, even when the location of
                            the well is to be within 30 meters of the boundary of the concession, if
                            he is given such reasons as the age of the concession, the importance of
                            the company, the necessities for exploitation of the locality, etc.</p>
                        <p>In other words, while the Minister does not admit the company’s claim in
                            principle, he promises a favorable decision for the two concessions
                            which are under discussion and decisions in other similar cases on the
                            basis of political expediency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hughes does not feel that there is any certainty for the future in
                            these promises. It is my impression that the Minister is seeking to gain
                            time without committing himself and that he is trying to avoid a
                            discussion with our Government on the principle of the vested rights in
                            the case. However, the company is willing to let the matter rest with
                            respect to the two concessions in question. For the above reason I have
                            not carried out the instruction in your telegram 41 of September 26 and
                            I will wait for further instructions.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow a collective protest regarding this interpretation of the mining
                            law will be presented to the Minister of Industry and Commerce by the
                            Association of Petroleum Industries of Rumania, of which all the big oil
                            companies are members. I am informed that the largest British company in
                            Rumania, the Astra Romana, has been denied permission for drilling
                            several wells under like conditions but has made no protest to British
                            Legation as yet.</p>

                                <p>“I have the honor to inform you that my Government has instructed

                                    1924, regarding the various questions which have recently been
                                    under discussion between the Governments of the United States
                                    and of Rumania and between certain nationals of those two
                                    countries. I also take pleasure in stating that my Government
                                    believes that the memorandum, by its detailed exposition of
                                    these questions, will tend to facilitate their further
                                    consideration and, it is hoped, early settlement.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States, viewing as it did with no
                                    little concern the difficulties which had arisen in connection
                                    with its endeavors to reach a ground of common understanding
                                    with the Government of Rumania, felt that the danger of future
                                    misunderstanding between the two Governments might be lessened
                                    by bringing clearly and unmistakably to the attention of Your
                                    Excellence’s Government its apprehension over the unsatisfactory
                                    status of certain questions of legitimate and immediate interest
                                    to this Government and to its nationals. Accordingly it decided
                                    to call Mr. Jay to Washington for a personal conference so that
                                    on his return to Rumania he would be fully cognizant of the
                                    position of his Government and of its attitude in the event that
                                    a satisfactory settlement of the principal points at issue could
                                    not be reached.</p>
                                <p>As Mr. Jay will therefore return to his post with a full
                                    knowledge of his Government’s views, it will not be necessary to
                                    enter into a detailed discussion in this communication of the
                                    matters which were dealt with in Your Excellency’s memorandum of
                                    July 21st. It seems important, however, to make a brief
                                    restatement of the principles for which my Government has
                                    consistently stood, principles which have been outlined in
                                    greater detail in the various communications addressed to Your
                                    Excellency by Mr. Jay.</p>
                                <p>Thus, it may be stated that my Government considers that any
                                    effort to impose upon American creditors without their consent
                                    the terms of the Commercial Indebtedness Law would constitute an
                                    unwarranted governmental interference with existing private
                                    contracts. My Government would not, of course, oppose the
                                    reaching of any mutually satisfactory agreement between American
                                    creditors and <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0729"/>Rumanian
                                    debtors. It feels, however, and must again emphasize, that the
                                    future of commercial relations between the two countries would
                                    be adversely affected by such governmental intervention between
                                    private creditor and private debtor as would impair the
                                    legitimate rights of the creditor.</p>
                                <p>With respect to the debts owed by the Rumanian Government to
                                    American nationals or companies, it is my Government’s earnest
                                    hope that your Government will see its way clear, in its own
                                    interest, as well as in the interest of the American nationals
                                    concerned, to arrive at mutually satisfactory agreements for the
                                    settlement of such indebtedness.</p>
                                <p>In connection with Your Excellency’s statements regarding the
                                    position of the Rumanian Government in respect of its
                                    indebtedness to the Government of the United States, I am
                                    instructed to point out that this indebtedness was incurred for
                                    relief and reconstruction purposes after the cessation of
                                    hostilities. Inasmuch as relief credits have generally been
                                    accorded a preferred position it could properly be considered
                                    that the advances made by the United States to Rumania are
                                    entitled to such preferences. Moreover, you will recall that Mr.
                                    Bratiano on behalf of the Rumanian Government gave certain
                                    definite assurances to the Government of the United States in a
                                    letter dated May 17, 1919.<note n="40" xml:id="d551fn40">Not
                                        found in Department files.</note> In the light of these
                                    assurances my Government is at a loss to understand the reports
                                    which it has received of the payment of substantial sums by
                                    Rumania to other governments on account of relief or
                                    reconstruction loans, no corresponding payments having been made
                                    to the United States.</p>
                                <p>Under these circumstances my Government is the more reluctant to
                                    conclude that it is the purpose of the Rumanian Government to
                                    await the consummation of agreements between the United States
                                    and all other powers which are indebted to the United States on
                                    account of loans incurred during the war, as well as after the
                                    armistice, before taking further action toward the payment of
                                    interest, the funding or other adjustment of the indebtedness of
                                    the Rumanian Government to the United States. In this connection
                                    I may invite Your Excellency’s attention to the agreements
                                    reached by the United States Government with the Governments of
                                    Great Britain, Finland, Lithuania and Hungary for the refunding
                                    of war and relief indebtedness to the United States<note n="41" xml:id="d551fn41"><hi rend="italic">Combined Annual Reports

                                <p>The point of view of this Government with respect to the Rumanian
                                    Mining Law has already been outlined in various communications
                                    which have been addressed to Your Excellency. This Law is the
                                    object of legitimate concern to American interests. My
                                    Government has noted the statement in Your Excellency’s
                                    communication that the Royal Government recognizes that it is
                                    the part of its duty to accord the most ample and complete
                                    respect to all vested rights either of foreigners or its own
                                    nationals. It is difficult, however, to <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0730"/>reconcile certain provisions of
                                    the recent mining legislation or the general policy which this
                                    legislation appears to indicate with a proper measure of
                                    protection for acquired rights. My Government has therefore
                                    instructed me to impress upon Your Excellency’s Government that
                                    any impairment of vested rights or any discrimination against
                                    American interests would be viewed with serious concern by this
                                    Government.</p>
                                <p>Further, it should be pointed out that at a time when the
                                    Rumanian Government is passing legislation calculated to
                                    postpone the payment of commercial debts by Rumanian debtors for
                                    a period of years on the ground that disturbed conditions and
                                    depreciation of currency make more prompt payment impossible,
                                    your Government, during this same period, is apparently
                                    endeavoring to force a liquidation of important American
                                    interests, which involves the purchase of these liquidated
                                    interests by Rumanian nationals. It is difficult to understand
                                    how in an economic situation in which it is said that funds are
                                    not available for the payment of existing debts it is yet
                                    possible that there will be available the substantial sums
                                    necessary for the purchase of important American holdings as
                                    apparently contemplated under the law.</p>
                                <p>Other phases of this subject will be taken up by Mr. Jay as
                                    occasion may arise, and it is not my Government’s desire to
                                    burden this communication with questions of detail. It is,
                                    however, its desire to impress the following situation upon the
                                    Rumanian Government: Cordial relations between countries depend
                                    upon mutual understanding and confidence. The measures which the
                                    Rumanian Government has recently taken have but served to shake
                                    that confidence and to raise the question as to whether the
                                    Rumanian Government is prepared to accord in the future the
                                    requisite degree of protection to American interests.</p>
                                <p>It is the earnest hope of the Government of the United States
                                    that Your Excellency’s Government will appreciate the importance
                                    of giving due weight to the above considerations and to the
                                    further considerations which Mr. Jay has been instructed to
                                    present in person.”</p>

                            translation. He expressed greatest pleasure at Mr. Jay’s return and
                            stated that he would take up with him the various points outlined in
                            this note. In reading through it hastily he said that the Department was

                            of the note regarding payments by Roumania to other Governments as no

                        <p>72. Legation’s telegram 66 of October 6. Yesterday the British Minister
                            received instructions from his Government and today he is making a
                            formal written protest to the Minister of Foreign Affairs against
                            mining-law provisions in articles 113 and 192 as applied to concessions
                            of the shape described in my telegram 62 of September 24, 7 p.m. and
                            obtained before the present law was proclaimed.</p>
                        <p>Today the head of the Romano-Americana called. He informed me that his
                            company had not obtained any satisfaction in the matter as described in
                            my telegram 64 of September 30, 5 p.m., that he did not expect any
                            favorable action by the Minister of Industry, and that the delay was
                            serious to the company. He urged that I protest at the same time as the
                            British did. He had heard today that the British were protesting. I told
                            him that I could not do as he proposed but that I would report his
                            views. It is my own feeling that in view of the note I presented today,
                            the British note, and the assurance which the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs gave me today that he had taken up the matter with the Minister
                            of Industry and expected a satisfactory solution soon, it might be
                            better to delay action for a little while.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Under date of October 15, 1924, there was
                            communicated to the American Chargé d’Affaires at Bucharest the text of
                            a note to <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0732"/>be submitted to the
                            Rumanian Government with respect to outstanding questions between the
                            Government of the United States and that of Rumania, and between the
                            nationals of the two countries. While you are thoroughly familiar with
                            this communication, which was drawn up after consultation with you, for
                            convenient reference a copy is enclosed herewith.<note n="42" xml:id="d555fn42"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_634">p. 634</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Considering that it might be helpful to you in connection with the
                            representations which you will make upon your return to Bucharest in
                            support of the position outlined in the above mentioned communication,
                            the Department takes this occasion to amplify in certain particulars the
                            views therein expressed and also to send you certain memoranda and
                            documents which you may find useful in this connection.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the introductory paragraphs, i. e. one to three
                            inclusive, of the note, it may be stated that the Department considers
                            the questions at issue between the two Governments are susceptible of
                            adjustment through negotiation, provided the requisite good will and
                            patience are manifest on both sides, and if the Rumanian Government is
                            sufficiently impressed with the importance which this Government
                            attaches to a satisfactory adjustment.</p>
                        <p>In the concluding sentence of paragraph 2, you will note that reference
                            is made to this Government’s [“] attitude in the event that a
                            satisfactory settlement of the principal points at issue could not be
                            reached.” While it would not be appropriate to attempt to indicate in
                            any detail the action which might be considered appropriate in the event
                            that the Rumanian Government failed to show the requisite good will in
                            working for a settlement of pending questions, the following suggestions
                            may be helpful to you: <list>

                                <item>The continued failure on the part of the Rumanian Government
                                    to accord the protection to American interests which they may
                                    properly and reasonably expect or to give due consideration to
                                    American claims would create a situation in which this
                                    Government would feel obliged to warn American citizens, about
                                    to embark in commercial ventures in Rumania, of conditions there
                                    existing and of the attitude of the Rumanian Government towards
                                    foreign commercial enterprises.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Under the present circumstances and until further steps have
                                    been taken toward the adjustment of pending questions, the
                                    Department would be disposed to offer objection to any attempt
                                    to float a Rumanian loan in this country.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Finally, if the Rumanian Government should not be disposed to
                                    give due consideration to the representations of the Legation,
                                    the Department might consider that no useful purpose would be
                                    served by maintaining a person of your rank and experience in
                                    Bucharest and that the Legation might therefore be left in
                                    charge of a Chargé d’Affaires for a period of time.</item>

                        <p>The information contained in the above paragraphs (<hi rend="italic">a–c</hi>) is for your guidance, but there would be no objection to
                            your orally indicating this Government’s views to the Rumanian
                            Government should you consider it desirable to do so.</p>
                        <p>With respect to paragraph 4 of this Government’s note, which relates to
                            the claims of American creditors against Rumanian nationals, you will
                            find the Department’s viewpoint stated in its written instruction No.
                            215 of August 22, 1923,<note n="43" xml:id="d555fn43"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_650">p. 650</ref>.</note> and in
                            paragraph No. 7 of its telegram No. 34 of August [<hi rend="italic">July</hi>] 30, 1924.<note n="44" xml:id="d555fn44"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_626">p.
                                626</ref>.</note> While Instruction No. 215 related specifically to
                            the Commercial Indebtedness Law, which the Department understands has
                            not yet been made applicable to American creditors, the principles
                            embodied therein are equally applicable to any other similar
                            governmental interference with private debts. In this connection your
                            attention is called to the so-called Term of Grace Law as extended from
                            time to time, which the Department understands prevents American
                            creditors from obtaining the payment of debts due them in American
                            currency even where the debtor is solvent. As indicated in the above
                            instructions, not only is this legislation discriminatory in that it
                            does not apply to all debts due in Rumania but only to those due in a
                            strong currency, but, since it prevents payment irrespective of the
                            financial capacity of the debtor to pay, it is an improper and arbitrary
                            governmental interference with the right of private contract for which
                            the Rumanian Government might be held liable to American citizens
                            suffering damage by reason of its action.</p>
                        <p>In evidence of the hardship that this legislation works upon American
                            creditors may be cited the Benco case. In this case a superior Rumanian
                            court has rendered a judgment in favor of the American creditor against
                            the Rumanian debtor and two Rumanian banks which guaranteed the debt.
                            Notwithstanding this, and although the banks guaranteeing the debts are
                            two of the largest financial institutions in the country and the debtor,
                            at the time the judgment was handed down, was solvent, the Department
                            understands that the creditor, to his serious financial embarrassment,
                            has been prevented from obtaining payment of the judgment by reason of
                            the continued extensions of the Term of Grace Law. In fact, according to
                            the information of the Department, the creditor is in danger of being
                            forced into bankruptcy by reason of the interference of the Rumanian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department has received telegram No. 68, dated October 10, 1924, from
                            the American Legation at Bucharest,<note n="45" xml:id="d555fn45"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_659">p.
                                659</ref>.</note> stating that it has <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0734"/>received a visit from a member of the Bucharest Chamber
                            of Commerce who had been appointed by the Rumanian Government as a
                            delegate to negotiate the settlement of pre-war and post-war private
                            debts due by Rumanians to Americans. This delegate of the Rumanian
                            Government proposed that either representatives of the American
                            creditors be appointed to negotiate directly with him, or that the
                            Legation be empowered to negotiate with him an agreement on behalf of
                            the American creditors. He suggested taking the British or Swiss
                            agreement with Rumanian debtors as a basis of discussion. A copy of this
                            telegram is attached, together with a copy of the Department’s
                                reply.<note n="46" xml:id="d555fn46">See telegram no. 46, Oct. 24,
                                to the Chargé in Rumania, <ref target="#pg_659">p.
                            659</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The Department, as already indicated, considers that private debts,
                            whether pre-war or post-war, owed between Rumanian and American
                            nationals should be adjusted by the interested parties directly and
                            should not be subject to governmental interference. This Government
                            would not be in a position to commit its nationals without their consent
                            in each case and, therefore, the Legation could not properly undertake
                            any negotiations of the nature indicated on behalf of American creditors
                            generally. Of course, should an American creditor, in any particular
                            case, desire to reach an agreement, either with the delegate appointed
                            by the Rumanian Government or with the Rumanian debtor, you may, at the
                            creditor’s request, render him such informal assistance as might be
                            proper.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the Term of Grace Law has recently again
                            been extended, notwithstanding the request of this Government that this
                            be not done. You should, therefore, renew and supplement the views set
                            forth in your note No. 104 of September 20, 1923,<note n="47" xml:id="d555fn47"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_652">p. 652</ref>.</note> and subsequent communications, and insist
                            that Rumanian laws or regulations should be such as to permit American
                            creditors to obtain payment from solvent Rumanian debtors. You may also
                            impress upon the Rumanian Government the views of this Government with
                            respect to the consequences of improper governmental interference
                            between debtor and creditor impairing the rights of the creditor.</p>
                        <p>The debts owed by the Rumanian Government to American nationals or
                            companies are dealt with in paragraph 5 of this Government’s note. With
                            respect to the notes of the Transoceanic Corporation held by the Chase
                            National Bank and the Equitable Trust Company, (see Department’s
                            telegram No. 32, July 24, 1924, 4 p.m.—copy enclosed<note n="48" xml:id="d555fn48">Not printed.</note>) the Department is gratified
                            to inform you of the receipt of information indicating that a settlement
                            satisfactory <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0735"/>to the American
                            holders of the bonds has been reached with the Rumanian Government. A

                        <p>In the matter of the claim of the Baldwin Locomotive Works against the
                            Rumanian Government, which was fully discussed with you and with the
                            representatives of that Company, there are enclosed copies of certain
                                correspondence,<note n="49" xml:id="d555fn51">Not printed.</note>
                            including instructions which the Company has sent to their Bucharest
                            representative, which relate to the negotiations with the Rumanian
                            Government for a settlement, by a system of deferred payments, of the
                            claim of the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Without, of course, intervening
                            in the negotiations, the Department desires you appropriately to impress
                            upon the Rumanian Government the importance of an early adjustment of
                            this claim.</p>
                        <p>For your information in connection with paragraph 6 of the note, which
                            relates to the Rumanian Government’s indebtedness to the United States,
                            there is enclosed a statement<note n="49" xml:id="d555fn52">Not

                            Finland, and Lithuania.<note n="49" xml:id="d555fn53">Not
                                printed.</note> The agreement with Lithuania has not yet, however,
                            been ratified by Congress. Negotiations are now pending with Poland and
                            Czechoslovakia for the settlement of their indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Rumanian Mining Law, the Department desires you
                            particularly to impress again upon the Rumanian Government the serious
                            view which this Government would take of any action calculated to impair
                            vested rights. From your conferences with the Department, you are
                            already familiar with this Government’s view in the matter.</p>
                        <p>You are also familiar with the correspondence between the Department and
                            the American interests concerned and with the Legation at Bucharest
                            regarding the reported decision of the Rumanian Government which would
                            have the effect of depriving the Romano-Americana Company of its right
                            to drill on plots where the wells cannot be spaced at least thirty
                            meters from the perimeter, whereas under the old law a distance of only
                            fifteen meters was required.</p>
                        <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0736"/>
                        <p>It may further be impressed upon the Rumanian Government that the policy
                            underlying the Mining Law is of a character to discourage American
                            enterprise from undertakings in Rumania and that it is difficult for
                            this Government to reconcile this attitude with the assurances
                            previously given to American interests, to which you have alluded in
                            your communications to the Rumanian Government.</p>

                                instructions received from my Government, I have the honor to inform
                                Your Excellency that, as a result of the regulations for the
                                application of the Mining Law and especially of Articles 113 and 192
                                of that law, the American oil interests operating in Rumania have
                                not, in spite of their requests addressed to the Ministry of
                                Industry and Commerce, yet been able to obtain authorization for the
                                installation of new wells on concessions obtained by them long
                                before July 4th 1924, date of the promulgation of the new Mining
                                Law, The Ministry of Industry and Commerce <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0737"/>has made known that its decision is
                                based on the above mentioned regulations, approved on September 9th
                                last, and this in spite of the fact of the priority of the
                                concessions in question to the present law, and of the fact that
                                their area is not sufficient to permit the installation of wells at
                                a distance equal to or greater than 30 meters from their boundaries,
                                without resort to the measures stated in Article 113 of the Law.</p>
                            <p>My Government is greatly surprised at the application of Articles 113
                                and 192 of the Mining Law to concessions obtained previous to the
                                promulgation of that Law, inasmuch as this decision, if enforced,
                                will apparently render valueless rights duly acquired under the law
                                as it existed at the time of such acquisition. In view of the
                                repeated assurances that all acquired rights would be left
                                undisturbed, it is hoped that the Government of Your Excellency will
                                not persist in the attitude apparently adopted by the Ministry of
                                Industry and Commerce regarding the installation of wells on
                                concessions obtained by American oil interests previous to the
                                Mining Law of July 3rd 1924.</p>
                            <p>My Government likewise reserves the privilege of making such further
                                communication on this particular phase or on any other phases of the
                                Mining Law as may appear necessary.</p>

                                have the honor to make known to Your Excellency the following
                                considerations on the subject of the objections of the American
                                Petroleum Companies:</p>
                            <p>(1) “Pooling” or the combining of small tracts of land whether
                                concessioned or not, in view of exploiting petroleum and natural
                                gases, is a measure which is merely aimed at the protection of the
                                field and its reasonable exploitation. (Art. 113 of the Mining
                                Law)</p>
                            <p>The measure enacted under the Law, fixing the distance of the
                                drilling at 30 meters from the boundary of the property, prevents
                                moreover an unfair competition between neighboring
                                exploitations.</p>
                            <p>The State, in taking these measures, has intended to insure, not only
                                the general welfare which it has to safeguard, but also the
                                interests <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0739"/>of the private
                                companies whose prosperity is primarily based on a rational
                                exploitation.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the directors and technical experts of the companies were
                                the first to request, more than 20 years ago, the regulation of
                                petroleum exploitation in the sense of the stipulations of Article
                                113.</p>
                            <p>(2) Pooling does not impair acquired rights. It simply regulates them
                                in view of a rational and equitable exploitation as between adjacent
                                exploitations.</p>
                            <p>The difficulties proceeding from the widespread division of the
                                ownership of the soil are felt, not only in the mining exploitation
                                of Rumania, but also in that of other countries. Thus, in Galicia,
                                the State has been forced to take analogous and very severe measures
                                to safeguard the ozocerite fields and to insure for them the
                                possibility of a methodical exploitation, seriously jeopardized by
                                innumerable exploitations on small tracts of land. The difficulties
                                of a similar situation are equally known in the English coal mines,
                                with the difference that coal, being a solid, cannot be mined to the
                                detriment of an adjacent owner, whilst petroleum and gas, being
                                fluids, can be extracted by borings which are too near the boundary
                                of the property. Under these conditions the distance of 30 meters,
                                provided by the law, defines the zone of influence of a well and
                                prevents the petroleum or gas of any one property from being
                                extracted by neighbors.</p>
                            <p>(3) The Mining Law, although having in view these considerations,
                                nevertheless grants the Ministry of Industry and Commerce the power
                                to reduce the distance of 30 meters. (Final paragraph of article
                                190.)</p>
                            <p>Under these conditions we can assure Your Excellency that the
                                Ministry of Industry and Commerce will examine with the greatest
                                benevolence all claims on this subject that the American companies
                                may present to that Department.</p>
                            <p>I take the liberty of asking you, Mr. Minister, kindly to consider if
                                it would not be well to advise the incorporated Rumanian companies
                                with American capital, whose claims have given rise to the
                                intervention of Your Excellency … that they may obtain more easily
                                all the elucidations and necessary solutions, by addressing direct
                                the mining authorities of the country, who are, moreover, competent
                                to examine and judge claims of this nature.</p>
                            <p>I consider it advisable once more to assure Your Excellency that the
                                Rumanian Government intends to do all that is necessary to respect
                                acquired rights and to satisfy legitimate interests of private
                                individuals on this subject.</p>

                            has replied by signed note briefly summarized as follows:</p>

                            pouch tomorrow to London requesting instructions.</p>
                        <p>British Minister and I, as well as our respective oil interests, consider
                            reply evasive and unsatisfactory. Suggestion in paragraph 4<note n="55a" xml:id="d559fn55a">See antepenultimate paragraph of the note <hi rend="italic">supra</hi></note> appears ridiculous as oil
                            interests have repeatedly applied to competent authorities without
                            obtaining satisfaction and often even reply.</p>
                        <p>As Minister of Foreign Affairs left today for three-day official visit

                            drafted by the Ministers of Finance and Industry and that the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs softened it. I have attempted to stiffen the attitude
                            of my British colleague and have suggested that to gain force we obtain
                            authority to reply simultaneously. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>51. The Department believes that at this time it might be undesirable to
                            engage in a long exchange of notes regarding just one provision of
                            Rumania’s mining law which is objectionable in so many features. The
                            Department suggests, therefore, that you do not discuss details of
                            Rumanian note<note n="56" xml:id="d560fn56">No. 59115, Nov. 18, <ref target="#pg_644">p. 644</ref>.</note> in your reply but limit
                            yourself to the statement that the first action taken under the law by
                            the Rumanian Government has tended only to confirm the view of our
                            Government <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0741"/>as to the serious
                            effect of this law upon American interests and that our Government can
                            not reconcile the repeated statements of the Rumanian Government that
                            rights which have been acquired would not be disturbed with a line of
                            action which, if followed persistently, would take from American
                            interests the opportunity of using in any profitable way certain rights
                            validly obtained before the law was enacted.</p>
                        <p>The Department will not give further instructions until it receives

                            Affairs.</p>

                        <p>80. Your telegram 51 of December 1. In discussing note the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs asked me to give him a written statement of my arguments
                            to show to the Ministry of Industry.</p>
                        <p>As I consider it to our advantage to reply at the same time as the
                            British do, although not in the same terms, I have delayed giving an
                            answer, awaiting the receipt by the British Legation of the instructions
                            which they expect.</p>
                        <p>My impression has been that personally the Minister of Foreign Affairs is
                            anxious for a settlement but is opposed by the Ministry of Industry
                            which has the support of the intractable Finance Minister, and
                            impression was confirmed by my interview. My oral protests, however, may
                            have taken effect as yesterday Minister of Industry most definitely
                            informed Seidell, the Standard Oil Company’s representative in Europe
                            here on tour of inspection, that their ten applications on file would be
                            granted now and that their future applications for drilling on
                            concessions received before the passage of the present law would also be
                            granted. This is pleasing to our oil interests, but they as well as I
                            are skeptical until the promises are carried out.<note n="57" xml:id="d561fn57">In despatch no. 731, March 11, 1925, the Minister

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith a
                            translation prepared by the Office of the Commercial Attaché, Dr. Van
                            Norman, of a “Law for the Regulation of Commercial Indebtedness” adopted
                            May 30, 1923, and promulgated in the <hi rend="italic">Monitorul
                                Oficial</hi> of June 3, 1923.<note n="58" xml:id="d562fn58">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It will be seen that Article 13 of this law states that it becomes
                            immediately operative in respect to debts contracted with British
                            creditors, and that the “Office for Special Payments in Foreign
                            Currencies” (provided for in the new law) may request the Council of
                            Ministers to apply the provisions of the law in respect to the creditors
                            of other countries, the currency of which is at least three times
                            higher—with reference to the leu—than the gold parity (pre-war parity
                            approximately 5 lei=l dollar; parity for past three months approximately
                            200 lei=l dollar), and who have not within the term of three months
                            provided by the so-called “Term of Grace Law”, (promulgated May 14,
                            1923) concluded separate conventions or agreements with their Rumanian
                            debtors, on the basis of the law of May 30, 1923, herewith communicated.
                            The “Term of Grace” is to allow sufficient time for the negotiation of
                            agreements with other countries. In the meantime, however, all creditors
                            are debarred from taking any action in the Rumanian Courts for the
                            collection of commercial debts owed them.</p>
                        <p>It follows, therefore, that, if, before the expiration of the three
                            months “Term of Grace” or August 14, 1923, no agreement is concluded
                            between American creditors and their Rumanian debtors, the former will
                            be compelled to accept the conditions imposed by the law of May 30th.
                            This is really the legal confirmation of the agreement concluded between
                            the merchants of Manchester, Bradford, London and Nottingham, who have
                            the largest claims against Rumanian merchants, amounting to a
                            total—according to the Commercial Secretary, Mr. Adams, of the British
                            Legation in Bucharest, of ten million pounds sterling. The terms of the
                            agreement with the British creditors were set forth in Special Report
                            No. 10 of the Commercial Attaché, of March 9, 1923, a copy of which is
                            herewith transmitted.<note n="58" xml:id="d562fn60">Not

                        <p>In this connection I have the honor to report that the only American
                            creditors whose interests in the matter have been brought to the <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0743"/>knowledge of the Legation as
                            being affected by this law are given below: <list>
                                <item>First: The claim of the Baldwin Locomotive Works for the
                                    payment of the amount due them by the Rumanian Government for
                                    locomotives has been the subject of a long correspondence
                                    between the Rumanian Government and the Legation (See Legation’s
                                    latest telegram No. 39, June 20, 3 p.m.<note n="59" xml:id="d562fn59">Not printed.</note>). Colonel Greble, the
                                    Bucharest representative of the Baldwin Locomotive Works,
                                    however, insists that his Company’s claim, being based on a
                                    special contract with the Rumanian Government, cannot under any
                                    conditions come under the purview of this law.</item>
                                <item>Second: The Commercial Attaché, Dr. Van Norman, informs the
                                    Legation that the International Harvester Company, through its
                                    Bucharest representative, Mr. T. Gottwald, has urged him to
                                    request the Legation to make a protest against the provisions of
                                    this law being applied to American creditors. It is reported by
                                    Dr. Van Norman that the International Harvester Company has
                                    instituted proceedings in the Rumanian courts for the collection
                                    of private debts amounting to, more than $400,000. I might
                                    mention in this connection that Mr. Gottwald, who is not an
                                    American citizen, but according to the Legation’s best
                                    information a German citizen, has never personally nor through
                                    any other representative of his Company applied to the Legation
                                    for protection. Furthermore, no representative of this Company
                                    in Bucharest during my incumbency at this post has ever been a
                                    member of, or attended a meeting of the American lunch club,
                                    which is a semi-commercial organization and the rendezvous of
                                    practically all the Americans engaged in business in Bucharest,
                                    and of which I am honorary president.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is to be noted here that French, Italian, Swiss, and Dutch claims
                            against Rumanian merchants probably greatly exceed for each of these
                            countries the total of similar American claims. For instance, the
                            Italian Commercial Attaché, Dr. Paleani, estimates the loss in principal
                            and interest involved for Italian creditors by the application of this
                            law at more than a billion lira.</p>
                        <p>Upon receiving a report on this law I immediately took occasion in a
                            personal interview with Mr. Duca, the Minister for Foreign Affairs to
                            lodge a precautionary protest on June 19, 1923, of which he made due
                            note along with those which I understand have been recently made been
                            made [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] by some of my colleagues. At this time
                            I gave Mr. Duca to understand that the Government of the United States
                            would not feel itself bound to accept the terms of an agreement made by
                            Rumania with respect to English creditors, and that my Government would
                            no doubt, as soon as apprised thereof, give <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0744"/>me instructions to make a formal protest against the
                            application of this agreement to American interests.</p>
                        <p>I should also mention that Mr. Duca, when I discussed the matter with
                            him, alluded to a Rumanian Commission now traveling abroad for the
                            purpose of concluding special arrangements with principal foreign
                            creditors on behalf of local merchants. He asked whether it would not be
                            possible for American creditors to treat with this Commission in Paris
                            or London, and suggested that our Commercial Attaché act as an
                            intermediary, as, he said, was being done by other commercial attaches
                            here. I told Mr. Duca that this would be quite impracticable, pointing
                            out that, aside from anything else, the American Commercial Attaché has
                            not a full list of American creditors of Rumanian merchants nor
                            authority to act on their behalf, our Government’s position on such
                            matters being different from that of certain other Powers.</p>
                        <p>I shall await the receipt of the Department’s instructions on the
                            subject, while keeping it constantly advised of any new developments or
                            complaints received by the Legation from American citizens with regard
                            to this law.</p>

                            despatch No. 420 of June 21, 1923, enclosing a translation of the
                            Rumanian Law for the Regulation of Commercial Indebtedness, adopted May
                            30, 1923, promulgated in the <hi rend="italic">Monitorul Oficial</hi> of
                            June 3, 1923.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Department approves of the action taken by you in the matter.</p>
                        <p>An examination of the law discloses a number of objectionable features.
                            It provides, in cases where agreements exist for the payment by Rumanian
                            nationals of debts in foreign currencies which have appreciated to a
                            certain extent above the normal exchange value of the lei, for a period
                            of from a minimum of twelve to a maximum of twenty years in which
                            payment can be made. It also fixes an arbitrary rate of interest of from
                            three to four per cent, according to the date on which the debt was
                            incurred, and provides for the payment of an additional percentage for
                            the amortization of the debt.</p>
                        <p>While it is possible that in some instances Rumanian debtors may not be
                            able to pay debts due in American or other foreign currency, in view of
                            the appreciated value of such currency as compared with <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0745"/>Rumanian lei, other Rumanian debtors
                            are undoubtedly amply able to pay the amounts due in foreign currency
                            and should be permitted to do so in accordance with their contracts
                            without governmental interference. Should an extension of time be
                            desirable in any instance, it is within the province of the interested
                            parties to make some arrangement to that effect.</p>
                        <p>You may again bring the matter to the attention of the Rumanian Foreign
                            Office, pointing out that the law in question is not only
                            discriminatory, in that it does not apply to all debts but merely to
                            those due in certain currencies which have appreciated in value as
                            compared with the lei, but that it seriously impairs the obligation of
                            private contracts entered into in good faith not only by substituting an
                            arbitrary, and, doubtless, in many cases, a lower rate of interest than
                            that which was provided by contracts but also by extending for a long
                            period of years the time in which payment can be made. You may state
                            that the Government of the United States considers that any attempt to
                            impose upon American creditors, without their consent, the law in
                            question, would constitute an improper governmental interference with
                            existing private contracts, and that the Government of the United States
                            cannot agree to the infringement of the rights of its nationals in the
                            manner proposed by the law.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s Instruction No. 215 of August 22, 1923,
                            concerning the Rumanian Law for the Regulation of Commercial
                            Indebtedness.</p>
                        <p>I note with satisfaction that my action in the matter met with the
                            Department’s approval.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the Department’s Instruction I addressed a Note to the
                            Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs under date of September 20, 1923,
                            a copy of which is herewith enclosed, embodying all the points to be
                            brought to the attention of the Royal Government.</p>
                        <p>I took the first opportunity of seeing Mr. Duca after his return to
                            Bucharest from the country and of bringing up this note, which I was
                            glad to find, he had already read. Upon his implying that its tone was
                            somewhat severe I emphasized that it was a matter about which my
                            Government was deeply interested and added that I felt that it was not
                            only fully justified but also not any stronger than <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0746"/>the protests he had received from many
                            of my colleagues. This latter assertion he admitted. His Excellency gave
                            me to understand,—thus confirming the rumors which have been reported by
                            the Legation,—that the Rumanian Government was seriously considering the
                            modification or even abrogation of this law.</p>
                        <p>My personal opinion is that this will be done in view of the very
                            vehement protests made by all the great powers and especially owing to
                            the desire of the Government to obtain the granting of the long promised
                            French loan. The French Government’s loans, nominally for the purchase
                            of war materials in France by Rumania, Czechoslovakia and Poland having
                            been—as the Department is probably aware,—held up by the French Senate,
                            I learn that Senator Berenger, who is I believe the Chairman of the
                            Finance Committee of the French Senate, is about to visit Rumania and
                            the other two mentioned countries for the purpose of investigating their
                            financial stability. As the very large French Commercial interests in
                            Rumania are receiving especially vigorous support from their Government
                            through its Legation here, I feel that this proposed visit is one more
                            reason to expect at least a very broad modification of the objectionable
                            law.</p>

                                relation to the leu is higher than the pre-war parity. As I informed
                                Your Excellency, I did not fail to communicate the full text of this
                                law to my Government which has taken due cognizance thereof.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States appreciates that while, in some
                                instances, Rumanian debtors may not be able to pay debts due in
                                American or other foreign currency, in view of the appreciated value
                                of such currency as compared with Rumanian Lei, other Rumanian
                                debtors are undoubtedly amply able to pay the amounts due in foreign
                                currency and should be permitted to do so in accordance with their
                                contracts without Governmental interference. Should an extension of
                                time be desirable in any instance, it is within the province of the
                                interested parties to make some arrangement to that effect.</p>
                            <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0747"/>
                            <p>My Government has charged me to inform the Royal Government that it
                                considers the law in question not only discriminatory in that it
                                does not apply to all debts but merely to those due in certain
                                currencies which have appreciated in value as compared with the lei,
                                but that it seriously impairs the obligation of private contracts
                                entered into in good faith not only by substituting an arbitrary,
                                and, doubtless, in many cases a lower rate of interest than that
                                which was provided by contract, but also by extending for a long
                                period of years the time in which payment can be made.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States will regard any attempt to impose
                                upon American creditors, without their consent, the law in question
                                as an improper governmental interference with existing private
                                contracts, and it cannot agree to the infringement of the rights of
                                its nationals in the manner proposed by the law.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s Instruction
                            No. 215 of August 22, 1923, and to the Legation’s Despatch No. 453 of
                            September 20th, concerning the Rumanian Law for the Regulation of
                            Commercial Indebtedness, I have the honor to transmit herewith to the
                            Department a copy of an <hi rend="italic">Aide-Memoire</hi> which I left
                            on November 21st with the Rumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>The subject of this latter communication was a rumored project of law
                            modifying that of June 3rd, 1923, against which I protested on September
                            20th, in accordance with the Department’s Instructions. As the terms of
                            the new draft of a law had not been made public at the time of making
                            the protest, the Legation’s only information thereupon was derived from
                            the local newspapers and current rumors. All reports, however, agreed
                            that a new law was to be passed embodying provisions for an absolute
                            moratorium of six months against all foreign creditors, who had not
                            entered into special arrangements with their Rumanian debtors similar to
                            the one made by the British.</p>
                        <p>In view of these reports a meeting was called on November 16th of the
                            Commercial Attaches of the following countries: the United States,
                            France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland to
                            discuss the moratorium law and to decide upon a suitable form of
                            protest.</p>
                        <p>The Legation was represented at this meeting by the Commercial Attaché
                            and Mr. Dennis. Great Britain was the only large creditor nation not
                            represented, due, probably, to the existence of the so-called <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0748"/>“Manchester agreement” between
                            British creditors and Rumanian debtors, which will not be adversely
                            affected by the provisions of the new law.</p>
                        <p>At this meeting it was the opinion of all present, except the Swiss
                            representative, whose countrymen have reached a similar agreement to
                            that referred to in the preceding paragraph, that the enactment of the
                            law in question should be anticipated by the presentation of vigorous
                            protests from the respective Legations represented. It was felt that a
                            series of protests lodged while some such law was under consideration by
                            the Rumanian Government might possibly effect its abandonment or, at
                            least, its modification. <hi rend="italic">En passant</hi> it is to be
                            noted that the opinion of my Colleagues, in which I concur, is that
                            objectionable anti-foreign laws are often prepared by a Minister in
                            secrecy and are rushed by the Government through a docile Parliament
                            without discussion in the almost complete absence of an articulate
                            opposition. A legislative <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> then
                            confronts the representatives of foreign countries against which
                            protests are almost useless, being met with the statement from the
                            Rumanian Government that the work of Parliament cannot be undone.</p>
                        <p>No set form of protest was adopted at the meeting, but it was considered
                            desirable that each foreign Minister call personally within the coming
                            week on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to set forth the objections of
                            his Government to the application of an absolute moratorium of six
                            months to all foreign claims against Rumanians, and to leave an <hi rend="italic">Aide-Memoire</hi> of the conversation. A similar <hi rend="italic">demarche</hi> before Mr. Vintila Bratiano, the
                            Minister of Finance, and author of this and all financial legislation of
                            the present Government, was recommended as even more useful than the
                            official and routine protest made to the Foreign Office.</p>
                        <p>Although at this meeting Mr. Dennis made it clear that the American
                            Legation was not associating itself with any joint <hi rend="italic">demarche</hi> in respect to this matter, I deemed it appropriate to
                            present on November 21st personally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            the precautionary protest above mentioned. It will be noted therefrom
                            that I merely reiterated the points outlined in the Department’s
                            Instruction No. 215 of August 22, 1923, protesting against the law of
                            June 3, 1923.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Duca informed me on November 23rd that he had already received
                            similar communications from my Colleagues of the countries which I have
                            already named as intending to take such action. He then called my
                            attention to the project of a law published for the first time that very
                            day, a translation of which is herewith enclosed.<note n="60" xml:id="d565fn60">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0749"/>
                        <p>According to this draft, the “term of grace” of the law of June 3rd is
                            prolonged for another three months from the date of the promulgation of
                            the new law. Mr. Duca attempted to explain away the force of the new law
                            by saying that it did not mention a general moratorium, but merely
                            prolonged the three months term of grace of the law of June 3rd for a
                            like period.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the new law does establish a moratorium for three
                            months, since, during this period, foreign creditors will not be able to
                            obtain the execution of judgments from the courts against delinquent
                            debtors. Foreign creditors are left no legal remedy other than recourse
                            to the “Rumanian Office for Payments” which will, to judge by the
                            experience of the past three months, not sanction any arrangement that
                            might reasonably be considered satisfactory by the creditors.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the information obtained by Mr. Dennis from the
                            Commercial Attachés of France, Italy and Czechoslovakia and the
                            Secretary of the Belgian Legation shows that the representatives of the
                            creditors of these countries who have, as national delegations, treated
                            separately with Mr. Vintila Bratiano’s special commission for the
                            settlement of their claims, have failed in every instance to reach any
                            understanding with the Rumanians and consequently broken off
                            negotiations. The principal reason for the failure of the conference was
                            the refusal of the Rumanian Commission to consent to the issue to
                            foreign creditors of obligations secured by the Rumanian Government for
                            the amounts of the postponed claims. All the foreign delegations
                            maintained the point of view that whereas the Rumanian Government was
                            denying to foreign creditors the conventional legal remedies for the
                            collection of private debts without allowing any lien on the property of
                            delinquent debtors, and whereas the debtors were to be given every
                            facility and advantage, furnishing an insignificant cash guarantee and
                            paying on their debts the low rate of interest of 4% plus 3 or 4% for
                            amortizement, the Rumanian Government should deliver to foreign
                            creditors so dealt with some form of state guaranteed commercial paper
                            for the sum of the unpaid debts which could be negotiated abroad.</p>
                        <p>As the Rumanian Foreign Office has constantly urged the Legation to
                            arrange for similar negotiations between American creditors and the
                            Rumanian Commission, it is especially interesting to note that these
                            conferences have been fruitless of satisfactory results. The present
                            phase of the situation seems to be that the Rumanian Government intends
                            to extend the so-called terms of grace until all foreign creditors shall
                            have been coerced to accept arrangements along the lines laid down in
                            the “Manchester Agreement.”</p>
                        <p>Lest it might be thought that the Manchester Agreement is not as unfair
                            to creditors as it appears, it should be stated that a great <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0750"/>many British creditors are highly
                            dissatisfied with it. Moreover the agreement was concluded at a time
                            when British exporters were enjoying special credit facilities from the
                            British Government, granted for the alleviation of the unemployment
                            situation in Great Britain. Hence merchants, British and others, whose
                            credit operations with Rumanians were not based on favorable national
                            appropriations cannot accept the terms of this agreement without grave
                            financial loss.</p>

                            <p>Having taken note of several indications which have recently appeared
                                in the press, relative to a Project of Law modifying that of June 3,
                                1923, on the payment of debts owed abroad by Rumanian merchants, the
                                Legation of the United States is desirous of ascertaining officially

                            December 20, 1923, between representatives of Rumanian debtors and the
                            French Consul and Commercial Attaché, respectively, acting as principals
                            for French creditors, who had authorized the last named so to act for
                            them. The most important features of the agreement are the following: <list>

                        <p>In reporting this agreement to the Department of Commerce, the Commercial
                            Attaché states, in a letter dated January 9, of which a copy is herewith
                            enclosed for the Department’s convenience,<note n="62" xml:id="d566fn62">Not printed.</note> that he considers it is now time for some
                            action of a similar nature to be taken in respect of American creditors
                            having debts of this character against private individuals or companies
                            in Rumania. He refers to the cases of the International Harvester
                            Company, which has a claim of about $400,000. against Staadecker and
                            Company now before the courts, also the case of Bencoe Export Company
                                <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Kosca and Banca Agricola for a sum of
                            about $40,000.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>There appears to be no reason to believe that the present Rumanian
                            Government, nor any one likely to succeed it, will permit, in the near
                            future, the courts of this country to give legal relief and apply legal
                            remedies in accordance with the commercial code and the customary laws
                            of the country against any debtors in Rumania on the petition of any
                            foreign creditors, where the debt belongs to the category covered by the
                            agreement herein reported. This conviction is shared by all the foreign
                            representatives in this capital, as shown by the fact that the two
                            largest creditor nations, England and France, have already concluded
                            special agreements, while Italy, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia are at
                            present negotiating towards this end.</p>
                        <p>It seems, therefore, that American creditors have the choice of
                            concluding an arrangement along the lines already laid down in the two
                            agreements just mentioned, or submitting to an indefinite
                            moratorium.</p>

                        <p>… four prolongations of three months each of the moratorium on foreign
                            claims of the classes affected by the laws of June 3 and December 16,
                            1923, have been successively voted by the Rumanian Parliament, the last
                            one having just been promulgated last week. These moratorium enactments
                            are necessary adjuncts to the Conventions and the laws stating and
                            applying them, as, obviously, the Courts must not be allowed to grant
                            the ordinary legal remedies to other foreign creditors to the prejudice
                            of those who have concluded special arrangements.</p>
                        <p>In the latest moratorium enactment, I understand that it is provided
                            that, should Parliament not be in session when the present three months
                            moratorium period expires, then the Council of Ministers may order a
                            further extension not to exceed five months.</p>
                        <p>It is the present policy, I believe, of the Rumanian Government to
                            continue these moratorium periods until agreements similar to the
                            “Manchester” and French types (the latter is fully reported in my No.
                            525 of January 21st) have been concluded with the creditors of all
                            countries having claims in “strong” monies against debtors in
                            Rumania.</p>
                        <p>It may be observed in this connection that the “French Agreement” is
                            considered here to be more satisfactory from the creditors’ point of
                            view than the “Manchester Agreement”.</p>
                        <p>I take occasion again to reiterate the opinion expressed in the next to
                            the last paragraph of my despatch No. 525 to the effect that American
                            creditors will not find any solution for their claims against Rumanian
                            debtors except in the manner followed by the British and the French.</p>

                        <p>68. Have today received visit of delegate appointed by Roumanian
                            Government from Bucharest Chamber of Commerce to negotiate settlement of
                            pre-and post-war private Roumanian debts to American creditors. The
                            acting commercial attaché of the Legation was present at the interview.
                            Delegate proposes either that representatives of American creditors be
                            appointed to negotiate direct with him or that this Legation be
                            empowered to negotiate with him agreement for American creditors. He
                            suggests taking British or Swiss agreement with Roumanian debtors as
                            bases of discussion with American creditors. He states that according to
                            Roumanian estimates pre-war debts aggregate about half a million dollars
                            but that he had been unable to secure any trustworthy estimate of
                            post-war debts. Please instruct.</p>

                        <p>46. Your 68, October 10, 1 p.m. Department considers that private debts,
                            whether pre-war or post-war, owed between Rumanian[s] and Americans
                            should be adjusted by the interested parties directly, and should not be
                            subject to governmental interference. See views of this Government set
                            forth in instruction 215, August 22, 1923, and in paragraph 7,
                            Department’s telegram 34, July 7 [<hi rend="italic">30</hi>], 1924, and

                        <p>Department informed that Rumania has disregarded this Government’s
                            request and has again extended Term of Grace Law, which it is understood
                            prevents American creditors from collecting debts due in American
                            dollars, even where Rumanian debtor may be perfectly solvent. As
                            heretofore indicated, Department considers such a blanket prohibition
                            preventing payment irrespective of financial capacity of debtor is an

                            and will make further representations upon his return. You may, however,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, having
                            learned that the Rumanian Government is under pressure to extend again
                            for a further period of three months the Term of Grace Law, which would
                            otherwise expire on December 15th, I addressed yesterday a Note to the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs repeating our views on the subject and
                            protesting against a further extension.</p>
                        <p>As will be seen from the copy I enclose, I have endeavored, while briefly
                            reiterating our views, to lay emphasis on the concern felt by the
                            Department, to indicate possible consequences and finally to place on
                            record in writing before the expiration of the present extension an
                            official protest against any further renewal.</p>
                        <p>I have laid stress on the impropriety of affording protection to the
                            solvent debtor rather than on the discriminatory nature of the
                            legislation—a contention vigorously denied in both Government and
                            commercial circles.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is well aware of the importance attached
                            to the entire subject by our Government, especially as only last week
                            (November 27th) during a long informal conversation in regard to all the
                            questions at issue I allowed Mr. Duca to read the actual views of the
                            Department which are so fully and clearly expressed in its Instruction
                            No. 319 of November 7th last.<note n="65" xml:id="d571fn65"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_637">p.
                                637</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>It must be admitted that the Rumanian Government finds itself in a very
                            difficult position, as collective commercial agreements <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0755"/>have been concluded with British,
                            French, Belgian, Italian, Swiss, and possibly other creditors, which
                            obligate the Government to prevent by legislation foreign creditors on
                            whose behalf no collective agreements exist, from obtaining execution of
                            judgment.</p>
                        <p>If the Rumanian Government were to permit American creditors to obtain
                            unconditional satisfaction of their claims, it would undoubtedly receive
                            vigorous protests from the foreign governments concerned, whose
                            nationals have been assured, by Rumanian legislation, protection against
                            any such favored treatment to creditors of nations which have not
                            concluded such agreements.</p>
                        <p>I fear that even if the Term of Grace Law is not given another extension,
                            it will in practice be found impossible on one pretext or another to
                            secure actual execution of judgments. Moreover, I understand that a “loi
                            d’imprévision” (A law giving Courts discretionary power to grant a term
                            of grace to debtors whose inability to meet their obligations is shown
                            to be the result of circumstances beyond their control), such as
                            apparently exists in certain countries observing the Code Napoleon, may
                            be shortly incorporated in the Rumanian Civil Code, thus permanently
                            replacing the Term of Grace Law.</p>
                        <p>The entire question of the payment of commercial debts is exceedingly
                            involved. It is most difficult to ascertain at all definitely just how
                            the laws and regulations are being applied, particularly in view of the
                            influence which (it is widely believed) the Government is privately
                            exercising upon the Courts.</p>
                        <p>The Department will have received the memorandum drafted by the Delegate
                            of the Bucharest Chamber of Commerce which was transmitted in the
                            Legation’s Despatch No. 676 of November 7th,<note n="66" xml:id="d571fn66">Not printed.</note> and which covers very fully
                            the situation from the Rumanian point of view.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a copy of a letter which our Acting Commercial Attaché has
                            kindly written me at my request,<note n="66" xml:id="d571fn67">Not

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: At the instance of my
                                Government I have the honor to address Your Excellency concerning a
                                matter which has been made <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0756"/>by the Legation the subject of previous representations to the
                                Rumanian Government. I refer to the so-called “Term of Grace” Law,
                                originally promulgated on May 17, 1923, and which has been extended
                                from time to time.</p>
                            <p>Although I have on several occasions brought to Your Excellency’s
                                attention the objections of my Government in connection with this
                                Law, I am now instructed to reiterate and explain more fully the
                                basis of these objections.</p>
                            <p>It is clear that this “Term of Grace” Law prevents private American
                                creditors from obtaining payment of debts due them in American
                                currency even when the private Rumanian debtor is solvent, unless
                                they are willing to submit to certain arbitrary terms dictated by
                                the Rumanian Government. My Government is unable to accept the
                                action of Your Excellency’s Government in applying the terms of this
                                Law to all debts due by Rumanian nationals to American citizens
                                regardless of the solvency of the debtor and it moreover considers
                                this legislation discriminatory inasmuch as it does not apply to all
                                debts due in Rumania, but merely to those due in a strong currency.
                                My Government views this legislation as an improper and arbitrary
                                governmental interference with the right of private contract, since,
                                irrespective of the financial capacity of the debtor to pay, it
                                subordinates payment to arbitrary terms imposed by the Government of
                                the debtors—an interference for which the Rumanian Government might
                                be held liable to American citizens suffering damage by reason of
                                its action.</p>
                            <p>I am therefore instructed to insist that Rumanian Laws and
                                regulations should be such as to permit American creditors freely to
                                obtain payment from solvent Rumanian debtors.</p>
                            <p>As it appears that the last extension of the “Term of Grace” Law
                                expires on the 15th of this month, I must once more reiterate my
                                Government’s formal request that this Law be either not again
                                extended, or else that it be modified in such a way as to permit
                                American creditors freely to obtain payments due to them from
                                solvent Rumanian debtors.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my Despatch
                            No. 689 of December 5th last, transmitting a copy of the Legation’s Note
                            of December 4th <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0757"/>to the Foreign
                            Office in regard to a further extension of the “Term of Grace” Law which
                            would otherwise expire on December 15th.</p>
                        <p>The Legation has as yet received no reply to this communication but the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me that he expects shortly to
                            send me a carefully prepared expose of the situation for transmission to
                            Washington. I understand that this will consist of a brief drafted by
                            the leading Rumanian financial and economic authorities, explaining the
                            impossibility of granting preferential treatment to American creditors
                            in view of the provisions contained in the collective agreements
                            concluded with all the more important foreign creditors.</p>
                        <p>As the Legation anticipated, a brief bill was presented to the Chamber of
                            Deputies on the 18th, and yesterday to the Senate providing for a
                            further extension of this law for three months, i. e. to March 15th.</p>
                        <p>This measure as voted by Parliament, while operative in practice from the
                            preceding expiration, becomes officially effective from the date of its
                            promulgation in the <hi rend="italic">Official Monitor</hi> which is
                            often delayed.</p>
                        <p>I enclose a translation of the text of the measure as presented to
                            Parliament together with its official explanatory preamble.<note n="67" xml:id="d572fn67">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Rumanian Press shows scarcely any interest in the matter, presumably
                            because these successive prolongations have been taken for granted in
                            commercial circles and generally.</p>
                        <p>In my despatch referred to above, I mentioned the probability that the
                            Rumanian Parliament would be asked in the near future to consider the
                            enactment of a “Loi d’imprévision”. I now understand that the draft of
                            such a law has been prepared by the Minister of Justice and that he
                            announced the day before yesterday in the Senate that his draft had been
                            approved by the Council of Ministers as well as by the Economic
                            Commission of the Government, and that he proposed to lay it before
                            Parliament in the near future.</p>
                        <p>While the Legation has as yet no information regarding the terms or
                            provisions of this proposed law, I would call attention to the
                            observations on this especial subject made by Dr. Van Norman on page 4
                            (paragraph 3) and page 5 (paragraph 1) of his letter of December 4th
                            transmitted in my Despatch 689.<note n="67" xml:id="d572fn68">Not
                                printed.</note> As pointed out therein, the object of such a law as
                            existing in other countries is not to afford protection to the solvent
                            debtor.</p>

                                Note to the Royal Rumanian Government the assurance that the death
                                penalty will not be enforced against criminals delivered by Rumania
                                to the United States of America for any of the crimes enumerated in
                                the said Treaty, and that such assurance is, in effect, to form part

                                no person charged with crime shall be extraditable from Rumania to
                                the United States, upon whom the death penalty can be inflicted for

                            extradition treaty to be concluded between the United States and
                            Rumania, I have the honor to transmit herewith this convention, in
                            French and English parallel texts which the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
                            Mr. I. G. Duca, and I signed on July 23rd at 6 o’clock in the afternoon
                            at the Foreign Office, Bucharest,<note n="69" xml:id="d574fn69"><hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> as reported in my telegram No.
                            50 of July 23.<note n="68a" xml:id="d574fn68c">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Just before signing the treaty the Rumanian legal authorities asked to
                            have the words “à être” added in Article XIV, so that the clause “il
                            continuera en vigueur” would read “il continuera à être en vigueur”. As
                            this change amplifies, without altering in any way, the sense of the
                            passage, I readily assented to its addition to the text, and <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0765"/>I feel hopeful that the Department will
                            be pleased to approve this decision.</p>
                        <p>In order to meet the Rumanian Government’s objection to the application
                            of the death penalty to criminals it might extradite to the United
                            States, I have, in accordance with the Department’s instructions,
                            annexed to the Treaty a protocol, in the form of a note, similar to the
                            one forming part of our extradition convention with Portugal.<note n="70" xml:id="d574fn70"><ref target="frus1908#pg_693"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1908, p.

                        <p>The signing of this treaty, as a result of the unremitting efforts of the
                            Legation since the receipt of the Department’s instruction of April 10,
                                1923,<note n="71" xml:id="d574fn71">Not printed.</note> is
                            particularly gratifying to me as this achievement has been the object of
                            unsuccessful negotiations carried on with the Rumanian Government since
                            1892 by at least four of my predecessors.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I desire to point out that the conclusion of the
                            Treaty would have been impossible without the French translation thereof
                            which was prepared by Mr. Dennis and submitted by him to the Rumanian
                            authorities, during the two months he was in charge of the Legation last
                            winter. Mr. Dennis also secured the acceptance by the Rumanian
                            Government of this French draft with certain minor modifications. Slight
                            changes were subsequently made in it by the Department. This text, with
                            the parallel English version originally furnished the Legation by the
                            Department, was signed yesterday.</p>
                        <p>In the last stages of the negotiations, taking advantage of the effect
                            produced on the Rumanian Government by the Department’s firm attitude
                            towards this country, recently manifested in connection with other
                            questions, I was able to hasten the signing of the Treaty. Thus the
                            conclusion of the Treaty was greatly expedited when I explained to Mr.
                            Duca that Rumania was one of the very few remaining countries with which
                            the United States had not yet been able to sign an extradition treaty,
                            and that I felt that prompt action on their part in this matter would
                            make a very favorable impression at Washington.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Senator Borah</hi>: I am advised that at a
                            recent meeting of your Committee when the extradition treaty recently
                            concluded with Rumania was under discussion, the Committee expressed a
                            desire to receive a statement of my views on the two following
                            questions:</p>
                        <p>1. Would it be satisfactory to the Rumanian Government to omit the
                            paragraph in our note, accompanying and made a part of the treaty,
                            reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In order to make this assurance in the most effective manner
                                    possible, it is agreed by the United States that no person
                                    charged with crime shall be extraditable from Rumania upon whom
                                    the death penalty can be inflicted for the offense charged by
                                    the laws of the jurisdiction in which the charge is
                                    pending.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">and to substitute therefor the simple assurance of this
                            Government that the death penalty would not be inflicted, and</p>
                        <p>2. If a treaty were entered into with Rumania with an accompanying note
                            to the effect last set forth, would the treaty, as including such a
                            note, have the effect of governing the situation in a given case where
                            the person extradited was subject to the death penalty under State law,
                            as against the laws of a State.</p>
                        <p>Replying to the first question, I may say that I think the indicated
                            change in the note would be satisfactory to the Rumanian Government,
                            which, in the counter draft it proposed to the draft extradition treaty
                            proposed by this Government, proposed (Article 7) that</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“In view of the fact the death penalty does not appear among the
                                penalties recognized by the criminal laws of Rumania, the Rumanian
                                Government will grant the extradition of criminals who, under the
                                criminal laws of the United States, would be liable to the said
                                penalty only on condition that the Government of the Republic of the
                                United States undertakes in a formal statement that the sentence of
                                death passed upon him shall not be carried out.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>In response to your second question, I may say that I am of the opinion
                            that if a treaty entered into with Rumania included an accompanying note
                            giving an assurance by the United States that the death penalty would
                            not be inflicted upon a person extradited from <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674" facs="0768"/>Rumania, that assurance so contained
                            would have the legal effect of governing the situation in a given case
                            as against the laws of a State.</p>
                        <p>However, it should be added, as bearing upon both the questions, that in
                            view of the practical difficulties which might be involved in
                            maintaining such assurances in a given case, I should be indisposed to
                            enter into such an arrangement with Rumania. Local authorities might be
                            in disagreement with the views of the executive branch of the Federal
                            Government on this matter, or might feel that they had no authority to
                            intervene in the matter. Because of the absence of competent counsel to
                            defend the accused, the case might not be correctly presented to the
                            courts or the appropriate legal steps might not be taken. It is even
                            conceivable that there might be interference by persons not in
                            authority, which would nullify the effect of the assurance.</p>
                        <p>May I add that possibly the effect of the ratification of the treaty in
                            its present form is not, as a practical matter, of so great importance
                            as might appear? In this connection I may point out that since 1908 the
                            United States has had an extradition convention with Portugal which
                            contains provisions like those under discussion. Nevertheless, in all
                            that time, notwithstanding the fact that Portugal is considerably more
                            accessible from the United States than is Rumania, the records of the
                            Department do not show that any request has been made to it by Federal
                            or State authorities in the United States to obtain the extradition from
                            Portugal of a person accused of murder. It can hardly be assumed that
                            this has been due to the fact of general knowledge by such authorities
                            of the terms of the treaty, for the Department’s experience does not
                            indicate the existence of such general knowledge of the extradition
                            treaties of the United States on the part of authorities who institute
                            extradition proceedings.</p>
                        <p>In any event, as will readily occur to you, with the treaty ratified as
                            concluded, Rumania will not offer any more of a refuge to murderers from
                            this country than it offers at present with no treaty of extradition in
                            force.</p>

                        <p>25. Today I received a note from the newly appointed Soviet Minister. He
                            has sent identic notes to other legations informing them that he has
                            presented his credentials and that he will be happy to establish
                            official and personal relations with the representatives addressed. The
                            other legations in similar circumstances are making courteous but
                            noncommittal replies. I am about to leave Vienna. Please send
                            instructions.</p>

                        <p>20. Friday afternoon Foreign Minister and wife issued invitations to
                            chiefs of missions for farewell dinner next Tuesday in honor of
                            Norwegian Minister recently named Minister to Moscow. Yesterday by
                            accident it was discovered Russian Minister here was invited and <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0770"/>had accepted. As dinner company
                            limited in numbers thus making opportunities for incidents numerous,
                            French, Belgian, and Dutch Ministers, latter dean of the diplomatic
                            corps, have declined to attend. I also have decided not to go although
                            my position delicate due to fact it is first invitation extended to me
                            by Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will seek an interview with him
                            tomorrow, and will informally express regret not being able under the
                            circumstances to accept his hospitality. I will avoid sending formal
                            note of regrets. As suggested, time was so short I have been obliged to
                            act in matter without waiting for instructions from the Department.</p>

                        <p>19. Developments reported in your telegram 22 of August 26, 4 p.m.,<note n="3" xml:id="d582fn3">Not printed.</note> are pleasing to the
                            Department with the exception of the statement made by you to the
                            Finnish Foreign Minister that you could not meet the Soviet
                            representative under any circumstances.</p>
                        <p>When a regime not recognized by the United States has a representative at
                            the capital of the country to which you are accredited there should be
                            no difficulty with respect to such representative in informal and
                            courteous relations as of one gentleman with another. When I was present
                            in 1922 at the celebration at Rio de Janeiro of <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0771"/>the centenary of Brazilian independence
                            I had no difficulty in meeting and having cordial relations with the
                            Mexican representative although the United States had not recognized
                            Mexico. Such private and personal relations are, of course, dependent
                            largely on the bearing and character of others, but there need be no
                            embarrassment to the American Government in maintaining its attitude of
                            nonrecognition while permitting ordinary courtesies of a personal
                            nature. You should try to conform to the above suggestions.</p>

                            expedition of engineers for the purpose of surveying the oil resources
                            of that area. This expedition was provided with passports issued by the
                            United States Department of State and duly vised by Japanese Consular
                            officials in New York City. Upon reaching Northern Sahalin, however, our
                            engineers were not only prevented by the Japanese authorities from
                            conducting any explorations, but were immediately placed and
                            continuously kept under military surveillance until they were landed by
                            a Japanese Government vessel at a port of Japan.</p>
                        <p>While thus excluding American industry from this territory, the Japanese
                            Government has permitted engineers of Japanese nationality not only to
                            make surveys in Northern Sahalin, but to undertake drilling operations
                            which have resulted in commercial production of oil. This oil is now
                            being exported to Japan in tank ships, a cargo of approximately 5,500
                            tons having reached Japan on September 13, 1924.</p>
                        <p>We invite your attention to the fact that this action upon the part of
                            the Japanese Government constitutes a clear breach of the declaration of
                            that Government at the Washington Conference on Limitation of Armament
                            that it would “observe the principle of nonintervention in the internal
                            affairs of that country, as well as the principle of equal opportunity
                            for the commerce and industry of all nations in every part of the
                            Russian possessions”.<note n="6" xml:id="d585fn6"><hi rend="italic">Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, November

                            so-called Soviet Government of Russia for the exploration and
                            development of oil resources in Northern (Russian) Sakhalin, you state
                            that your engineers were prevented by the Japanese authorities in
                            occupation of that territory from conducting any explorations; and that
                            while preventing the operations contemplated by your company, the
                            Japanese authorities have permitted their own nationals to carry on
                            operations which have resulted in a commercial production of oil. You
                            ask that this Department request the Japanese authorities to issue such
                            instructions as would obviate further interference with the exploration
                            of Northern Sakhalin by employees of your company.</p>
                        <p>The question presented by this request was considered by the Department
                            when, under date of February 7, 1923,<note n="7" xml:id="d586fn7"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_802"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    802</ref>.</note> you advised it of the conclusion of a contract
                            made originally with the so-called Far Eastern Republic and thereafter
                            confirmed by the so-called Soviet Government of Russia, and requested
                            this Department to approach the Japanese Government with a view to
                            facilitating operations under the contract in question. You will recall
                            that the Department, in a reply to you dated March 17, 1923,<note n="8" xml:id="d586fn8"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_804"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 804</ref>.</note> expressed its regret that
                            it did not feel in a position to present the matter to the Japanese
                            Government in view of the circumstances; and the considerations the
                            Department then pointed out still hold good.</p>

                            “Nothing is further from the thought of the Japanese Government than to
                            take advantage of the [present] helpless condition of Russia for
                            prosecuting selfish designs” and that “It would observe the principle of
                            non-intervention … and equal opportunity for the commerce and industry
                            of all nations in every part of the Russian possessions.”<note n="10" xml:id="d587fn10"><hi rend="italic">Conference on the Limitation of

                                p. 346.</note> Your attention was drawn to the fact that American
                            nationals desired to explore Northern Sahalin and that the Japanese
                            military authorities, while permitting their own nationals to carry on
                            work, had refused to allow any operations by Americans. We asked that
                            the Japanese Government be requested to issue to its officials the
                            instructions necessary to insure the carrying out of its pledges to
                            you.</p>
                        <p>Your letter of November 8th [<hi rend="italic">7th</hi>] shifts from the
                            point of our letter of October 15th to a statement concerning your
                            attitude to the government which is now, and for a considerable time has
                            been, in control of Russian affairs. It was not the purpose of our
                            letter of October 15th to enter into a discussion of the Soviet
                            Government or its acts. The complaint made was not of any act of the
                            Soviet Government, but of the acts of the Japanese Government and the
                            request therein contained was based solely on the pledges of the
                            Japanese Government to the American Government, which you have stated
                            you interpreted to mean:—”That Japan does not seek through her military
                            occupation [<hi rend="italic">operations</hi>] … to obtain any unfair
                            commercial advantages … or to set up an exclusive exploitation either of
                            the resources of Sahalin or the maritime provinces.”<note n="11" xml:id="d587fn11">See <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p.
                            348.</note></p>
                        <p>The question is fundamentally one of the “Open Door” and so far as there
                            is any conflict it is simply one of American and Japanese national
                            interests. The essential point of our letter is whether when there is a
                            conflict between the economic and strategic interests of Japan and the
                            United States, the course of the American State Department is to be one
                            which has the effect of assisting Japanese interests or vice versa.</p>
                        <p>What we asked, and this request we repeat, is that the Department bring
                            to the attention of the Japanese Government the desire of American
                            nationals to conduct operations for oil in Northern Sahalin, pointing
                            out that the assurances heretofore given to the American Government by
                            the Japanese Government require, if faithfully carried out, that
                            Japanese officials be instructed not to <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0775"/>interfere with American nationals in work they
                            undertake in Northern Sahalin.</p>

                            in September last the United States warship <hi rend="italic">Bear</hi>
                            entered Kolyuchin [Bay?] in the Sinaeva Gulf without permission from the
                            Soviet authorities. A similar report has been received from the
                            authorities of Batum stating that on the 15th of January the American
                            destroyer number 223 entered that port without permission.</p>
                        <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0776"/>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the circumstances under which the
                            above-mentioned ships entered Soviet harbors constitute a violation of
                            the universally recognized rules governing the entrance of warships into
                            foreign ports, the Government of the Soviet Socialist Republics finds
                            itself obliged to protest against such action on the part of ships under
                            the direct control of the United States Government and expects that the
                            United States Government, professing the necessity of strict observation
                            of international laws, will take proper measures to avert the repetition
                            of such incidents in the future.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the call of destroyers at the port of Batum, the
                            Department considers that it is desirable that such calls should be
                            discontinued and the High Commissioner at Constantinople is being
                            informed of this view. The Department has added that in case a serious
                            situation should arise affecting the work of the Near East Relief in the
                            Caucasus or the safety of American citizens in that area, which, in the
                            opinion of the High Commissioner, would justify any modification of this
                            policy, he should report to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The Department would appreciate it if the Navy Department should see fit
                            to send instructions to Admiral Bristol with regard to the discontinuing
                            of further calls of destroyers under his command at the port of

                        <p>320. Local Union authorities delivered Moscow round brass mark discovered

                            Emma Bay, Cape Puzino. Said mark set in rock bears following
                            inscription: <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0777"/>“United States

                            imprisonment.” This mark set up July, 1920, shows magnetic observations
                            had been carried out in mentioned and subsequent years by guard cruiser
                                <hi rend="italic">Bear</hi> belonging to United States Government.
                            While pointing out that repeated entry of American war vessel into
                            territorial waters of Union Republics without permission contrary to
                            international law, I must emphasize that setting up of above-mentioned
                            mark and threat to Soviet citizens borne by it constitute gross
                            violation of sovereignty of Soviet Republics. Emphatically protesting to
                            United States Government against such lawless acts of their official,
                            obviously unable to distinguish where their own state territory ends and
                            another sovereign country’s territory begins, am obliged to notify that
                            such violation of legitimate rights of Union Republics if repeated will
                            be sternly repressed by Soviet Government.</p>

                        <p>12. Your telegram no. 15 of April 3 concerning treaty. This Government is
                            giving careful consideration to the subject of the importation of
                            Spanish grapes. The New York fruit exchange has engaged Dr. M. D.
                            Leonard to go to Spain and spend the season assisting growers to
                            eradicate the infection. He will sail within ten days. Dr. Leonard was
                            formerly acting entomologist of the State of New York and is a
                            collaborator of the Department of Agriculture. Before harvest time the
                            Department of Agriculture will reach a decision as to the danger from
                            the importation of grapes.</p>
                        <p>It will not be possible, obviously, to conclude a treaty before the
                            existing <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> expires on May 5. Trade
                            between the United States and Spain is already being adversely affected
                            by the uncertain situation respecting the rate of duties which may
                            become applicable to exports from this country to Spain. It is
                            desirable, therefore, that arrangements for a further <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> be promptly made so that each country may be
                            assured of equality of treatment for exports to the other.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed, therefore, to take up this matter immediately with
                            the Spanish Government and to ask whether, in view of considerations
                            indicated above and of the fact that it is apparently impossible to
                            reach a definite agreement regarding future commercial relations between
                            the two countries, that Government is willing to give the benefit of
                            minimum tariff rates for products from the United States in return for
                            like treatment of Spanish products entering <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0780"/>the United States. The extension provided in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> should be for a period not shorter
                            than six months. Reply by cable.</p>
                        <p>The American Government under the present arrangement may not as a matter
                            of right claim advantages conceded to other countries by Spain in
                            agreements entered into since the present arrangement was agreed upon
                            last October.<note n="7" xml:id="d594fn7">By exchange of notes dated
                                Oct. 6 and 22, 1923, <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_873"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 873</ref>.</note> The Tariff
                            Commission has informed the Department that Spain grants lower duties to
                            certain Italian products which are not extended to American products.
                            Crude sulphur is one of the items affected. When coming from the United
                            States it pays a duty of 3 pesetas per 100 kilograms while sulphur from
                            Italy pays 2.70 pesetas. The differential in duties affects a number of
                            other items. These concessions to Italy are made under a commercial
                            agreement between Italy and Spain which became effective December 10,
                            1923.</p>
                        <p>In view of these discriminations our Government would be justified under
                            section 317 of the tariff act of 1922<note n="8" xml:id="d594fn8">42

                            Spanish goods. In continuing the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            the arrangement should extend treatment no less favorable to goods
                            imported from the United States than that given to like articles
                            imported from any other country.</p>
                        <p>It is provided in section 317 of the tariff act that 30 days’ notice be
                            given before any increase in duties proclaimed by the President is
                            brought into force. It is desirable, therefore, that our Government
                            should learn as soon as practicable whether the Spanish Government is
                            willing to enter into a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> so that if
                            the action suggested above appears necessary there will be as little

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: With reference to our recent
                            conversations regarding the commercial relationship between the United
                            States and Spain, I have the honor to express to you the hope that,
                            pending the conclusion of a new treaty of commerce between the two
                            Governments, it will be agreeable to the Government of Spain as it is to
                            the Government of the United States to maintain the commercial relations
                            between the United States and Spain on a basis of unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>By such an arrangement it would be understood that no conditions,
                            prohibitions or restrictions would be imposed by either country on the
                            importation of any article, produced or manufactured in the territories
                            of the other than are or shall be imposed on the importation of any like
                            article, produced or manufactured in any other foreign country, and that
                            with respect to classification, valuation, import duties and other
                            similar charges, the products of each country would be admitted to
                            importation into the territories of the <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0786"/>other on terms no less favorable than those which are
                            or may be applicable to the similar products of any other country.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, no conditions, prohibitions or restrictions and no higher or
                            other duties or charges would be imposed by either country on
                            exportations to the territories of the other than are imposed on the
                            like articles exported to any other country.</p>
                        <p>It would be understood, however, that this undertaking regarding imports
                            and exports would not restrict the right of either country to impose on
                            such terms as it might see fit prohibitions or restrictions of a
                            sanitary character designed to protect human, animal, or plant life, or
                            regulations for the enforcement of police or revenue laws; nor would it
                            extend to the treatment which is accorded by the United States to the
                            commerce of Cuba or to the commerce between the United States and any of
                            its dependencies or the Panama Canal Zone under existing or future laws
                            or among the dependencies of the United States; nor to any special
                            treatment which Spain has conceded or may concede to the products of
                            Portugal or to those originating in and proceeding from the Spanish Zone
                            of Morocco, or to the commerce of Spain with any of its
                            dependencies.</p>
                        <p>It would be satisfactory to the United States to have the arrangement

                        <p>38. Embassy’s 39 of August 26, 4 p.m. Department desires that appropriate
                            aid be given to obtain a fair and equal opportunity for American
                            interests, but our Government does not approve of monopolies. It is
                            against the practice of the Department to aid American interests in
                            securing monopolistic privileges or concessions which would exclude
                            competing American firms, and the Department does not wish to have its
                            representatives abroad give such assistance. The importance of this will
                            be appreciated by you as our Government is constantly making protests to
                            other governments against the giving to nationals of other countries
                            exclusive concessions.</p>
                        <p>The Department has made note of your statement that you have aided
                            certain American telephone interests in winning monopolistic telephone
                            rights in Spain. Department wishes immediate report on this phase of

                        <p>41. Your 38, August 29, 7 p.m. As noted in royal decree, copy of which
                            was forwarded several months ago to the Department,<note n="16" xml:id="d607fn16">Not printed.</note> the concession was open to
                            proposals from all countries. There was only one American company<note n="17" xml:id="d607fn17">The International Telephone and Telegraph
                                Co.</note> which sought the concession. The issue narrowed down to
                            which telephone system should be adopted, the American or the Swedish. I
                            naturally thought that American system would be favored by the
                            Department. My assistance consisted in informing Spaniards that American
                            business interests always knew how to carry out big projects and that
                            the American telephone system was not equaled anywhere. In the future I
                            shall make no recommendations before receiving instructions from the
                            Department. I am forwarding by mail copies of the decree.<note n="16" xml:id="d607fn18">Not printed.</note></p>

                            points in royal decree granting telephone concession.</p>
                        <p>Concession will go into effect within 6 months and will run 20 years.
                            Eighty percent of the personnel to be Spanish. Government will receive
                            at least 10 percent of the net profits. Deposit of 5,000,000 pesetas.
                            State lines to be taken over at once and others to be secured by special
                            negotiations on termination of which previous concessions will lapse.
                            Three Government officials representing Ministries of the Treasury, War,
                            and Interior are to aid in administration and in case of war with
                            another nation or serious internal disturbances the State may take over
                            control. The contract is transferable with the consent of the State.</p>
                        <p>This concession is granted to Spanish company<note n="18" xml:id="d609fn18">Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España.</note>

                        <p>Excellency: The treaty of arbitration concluded between the United States

                            August 18th, 1913. However, no agreement for a further extension having
                            been made, the treaty expired on August 18th, 1918. As Your Excellency
                            will please to remember in this connection, a treaty looking to the
                            promotion of general peace still exists between the two countries in so
                            far as the treaty concluded between the United States and Sweden on
                            October 13th, 1914,<note n="3" xml:id="d610fn3"><ref target="frus1915#pg_1290"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, 1915, p.
                                    1290</ref>.</note> regarding the submission, for investigation
                            and report to a permanent international commission, of disputes
                            concerning which recourse can not be had to arbitration, still remains
                            in force.</p>
                        <p>Considering the ever increasing tendency to settle, by way of
                            arbitration, such international disputes which by their nature are
                            adapted to such procedure, and which can not be settled through
                            diplomatic negotiations, the Swedish Government would deem it desirable
                            that a new treaty of arbitration be concluded between the two countries.
                            Besides, the international procedure of investigation adopted by the
                            treaty of October 13th, 1914, seems to assume, as a complement, a treaty
                            of arbitration between the United States and Sweden.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, and acting upon instructions from my
                            Government, I have the honor to ask if the United States Government
                            would be willing to enter into negotiations looking to the conclusion of
                            a treaty of arbitration between the United States and Sweden.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of November 6, 1922, in which, with reference to
                            the expiration on August 18, 1918, of the Arbitration Convention
                            concluded between the United States and Sweden on May 2, 1908, and
                            extended by the agreement of June 28, 1913, you inform me that the
                            Government of Sweden deems it desirable that a new treaty of Arbitration
                            be concluded between the two Governments, and inquire, by direction of
                            your Government, whether the United States would be willing to enter
                            into negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty of arbitration with
                            Sweden.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States would be pleased to conclude with the
                            Government of Sweden an Arbitration Convention similar to the one
                            concluded between the two Governments on May 2, 1908, a copy of which is
                            transmitted herewith.<note n="4" xml:id="d611fn4"><ref target="frus1908#pg_731"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1908, p. 731</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Should the Government of Sweden desire to propose any provisions
                            differing from those of the Convention of 1908, I should be pleased to
                            receive and consider them, as well as to be informed concerning the
                            views of the Government of Sweden with respect to the conclusion of an
                            agreement of the character of the Convention of 1908.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Sweden may be disposed to consider whether it would not
                            be desirable in any new convention of arbitration which may be concluded
                            by Sweden and the United States that the stipulation relating to
                            duration which in the Convention of 1908 was for a term definitely
                            limited to five years should be elaborated so as to provide for duration
                            for an initial period of five years and for continuance in force
                            indefinitely thereafter until the expiration of one year after a notice
                            of termination shall have been given by either party. Provisions of this
                            character are contained in Article III of the Arbitration Convention
                            concluded by the United States with Peru on December 5, 1908, which has
                            been in force continuously since the exchange of ratifications on June
                            29, 1909, and in conventions in force between the United States and
                            several other countries. A copy of the Arbitration Convention of
                            December 5, 1908, between the United States and Peru is enclosed.<note n="5" xml:id="d611fn5"><ref target="frus1909#pg_498"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, 1909, p. 498</ref>.</note></p>

                            receipt of the note of January 19th, in which Your Excellency has been
                            kind enough-to inform me, in answer to my note of November 9 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>], 1922, that the Government of the United
                            States would be pleased to conclude with the Government of Sweden an
                            Arbitration Convention, similar to the one concluded between the two

                            desire to propose any provisions differing from those of the Convention
                            of 1908, Your Excellency would be pleased to receive and consider them,

                            of the convention of 1908.</p>

                            modifications:</p>
                        <p>In Article I of the Treaty of 1908, it was stipulated that differences of

                            between the two Contracting Parties, and which it might not have been
                            possible to settle by diplomacy, should, with certain specified
                            reservations, be referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration
                            established at the Hague by the Convention of July 29, 1899.<note n="7" xml:id="d612fn7">Malloy, <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>, 1776–1909,

                            offer, in several respects, great advantages, it would seem appropriate
                            that, in the new Convention which may be concluded, the said Tribunal be
                            indicated as the forum for the settlement of differences mentioned in
                            the Convention.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in Article I</p>

                        <p>This modification necessitates a certain amendment of the original

                            the Contracting Parties in each individual case, no reference to the
                            powers of the Arbitrators nor to the periods to be fixed for the
                            formation of the Arbitral Tribunal or the several stages of procedure,
                            will be needed.</p>

                            with the suggestion made in Your Excellency’s note with the exception
                            only that while Your Excellency has pleased to propose the duration of
                            the new Convention for an initial period of five years and for
                            continuance in force indefinitely thereafter until the expiration of one

                            party, the Swedish Government suggests that the last mentioned period be
                            only six months.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to your note of
                            February 9, 1923, relating to the proposal made by the Government of
                            Sweden that a, new Arbitration Convention be concluded by the United
                            States and Sweden, and transmitting upon instructions of your Government
                            a draft which is the French text of the Arbitration Convention of 1908,
                            between the United States and Sweden, modified in Articles I and II in
                            respect to the tribunal to which questions of difference which may arise
                            within the scope of the Convention shall be referred and in Article IV
                            in regard to the length of the period of notification of termination of
                            the Convention.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the suggestion of your Government that the Permanent
                            Court of International Justice, established at The Hague under the
                            Protocol of December 16, 1920, instead of the Permanent Court of
                            Arbitration established by the Convention concluded at The Hague on July
                            29, 1899, be indicated in Article I of the Convention now proposed as
                            the tribunal to which the United States and Sweden will agree to resort
                            for the judicial settlement of differences, I would state that this
                            Government, not having given adhesion to the Protocol under which the
                            Permanent Court of International Justice was established, would not
                            consider it to be desirable for it to enter into a stipulation in an
                            Arbitration Convention with another power to refer matters of difference
                            which may arise between <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0793"/>them to
                            that Court. For this reason the United States is not in a position to
                            accept at this time Articles I and II of the draft convention
                            transmitted with your note of February 9, 1923, in which is incorporated
                            the suggestion of the Government of Sweden that the Permanent Court of
                            International Justice be agreed upon as the tribunal of reference.</p>
                        <p>I am happy to assure you, however, that if the Government of Sweden on
                            giving further consideration to the matter should be disposed to
                            conclude at this time an Arbitration Convention with the United States
                            providing, as did the Convention of 1908, that the Permanent Court of
                            Arbitration established at The Hague shall be the tribunal to which
                            resort would be had by the United States and Sweden, for the arbitration
                            of differences, the United States is ready to conclude a Convention
                            similar to the Convention concluded on May 2, 1908, with the following
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>On February 24 last the President proposed to the Senate that it consent
                            under certain stated conditions to the adhesion by the United States to
                            the Protocol of December 16, 1920, under which the Permanent Court of
                            International Justice has been created at The Hague. As the Senate does
                            not convene in its regular session until December next, action upon this
                            proposal will necessarily be delayed. In the event that the Senate gives
                            its assent to the proposal, this Government would be prepared to accept
                            the proposal of the Government of Sweden that matters of dispute between
                            them be referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice and
                            would wish to be able to rely upon a previous assurance that the
                            Government of Sweden would not be adverse to considering a modification
                            of the Convention of Arbitration, which it is now proposed to conclude,
                            or the making of a separate agreement, under which the disputes
                            mentioned in the Convention could be referred to the Permanent Court of
                            International Justice.</p>
                        <p>Upon the assurance from yourself that your Government is disposed to
                            conclude an Arbitration Convention similar to the Convention of 1908
                            with such an understanding, I shall at once arrange to have the draft of
                            a convention prepared for your consideration and send you in advance a
                            copy of my proposed note; and I shall be glad in that event to receive a
                            copy of your Government’s proposed reply with respect to the
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion of the Government of Sweden that the period of duration of
                            the Convention after a notice of termination shall have been given by
                            either Government shall be six months as provided in Article IV of the
                            draft accompanying your note is acceptable to this Government.</p>

                            Convention of Arbitration between the United States and Sweden,
                            providing for the submission of differences of certain classes which may
                            arise between the two Governments to the Permanent Court of Arbitration
                            established at The Hague under the Conventions for the Pacific
                            Settlement of International Disputes concluded in 1899 and 1907, I have
                            the honor to state the following understanding which I shall be glad to
                            have you confirm on behalf of your Government.</p>
                        <p>On February 24, 1923, the President proposed to the Senate that it
                            consent under certain stated conditions to the adhesion by the United
                            States to the Protocol of December 16, 1920, under which the Permanent
                            Court of International Justice was created at The Hague. In the event
                            that the Senate gives its assent to the proposal, I under <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0798"/>stand that the Government of Sweden
                            will not be averse to considering a modification of the Convention of
                            Arbitration which we are concluding, or the making of a separate
                            agreement, under which the disputes mentioned in the Convention could be
                            referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is understood that American consular
                            officers are representing Swiss interests in Egypt as applied especially
                            to citizens of the German-Swiss cantons. It is also understood that
                            their activities have included the following: <list>
                                <item>Registration and issuance of certificates of
                                    registration.</item>
                                <item>Visa of Swiss passports and issuance of necessary travel
                                    passports.</item>
                                <item>Notarial acts and recording of unofficial documents.</item>
                                <item>Recording of births, deaths and marriages, and similar matters
                                    involving civil status.</item>
                                <item>General exercise of good offices in protection, whereabouts
                                    and welfare and similar matters.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>It is further apparent that no fees have been charged for the
                            above-mentioned services.</p>
                        <p>It is being pointed out to the Consuls at Alexandria, Cairo and Port Said
                            that it is the desire of the Swiss Government that the activities in
                            behalf of its nationals by American consular officers in Egypt be
                            continued for the present.</p>
                        <p>They are accordingly being informed that the Department authorizes the
                            continued representation of Swiss interests in Egypt. It is, however, of
                            the opinion that notarial services for Swiss citizens are of doubtful
                            value inasmuch as these services may be rendered useless by existing
                            local laws in the places in which the documents are to be used. They are
                            being directed, therefore, to avoid the rendition of these services
                            unless they are satisfied that they will be of value under the existing
                            laws. Furthermore, it seems to the Department that they should confine
                            their passport activities to the visaing of Swiss passports and that
                            they should not undertake to issue such passports <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0801"/>unless they have been clearly
                            authorized so to do by the Swiss Government and definitely instructed by
                            it as to its requirements and as to the procedure to be followed. It
                            seems to the Department manifestly unfair to require the payment of fees
                            by American citizens and to render services gratuitously to the citizens
                            of Switzerland. The consular officers in Egypt are being instructed,
                            therefore, to charge fees in accordance with the Swiss Tariff of Fees
                            and if they do not have such tariff available, they will inform the
                            Department at once in order that it may request copies for them. In the
                            meantime they should follow the United States Tariff of Consular Fees.
                            Fees collected for Swiss services should be transmitted to the Treasury
                            of the United States under the provisions of General Instruction No. 330
                            of July 10, 1914.<note n="3" xml:id="d622fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It is observed that American consular officers in Egypt have not been
                            exercising judicial authority on behalf of Swiss citizens and it should
                            be stated that the abstention from this service has the Department’s
                            approval inasmuch as the exercise of such judicial authority by American
                            consular officers would not be warranted under existing American laws.
                            American consular officers are not permitted to exercise judicial
                            authority in extraterritorial countries on behalf of the nationals of
                            other governments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            No. 62 of June 30, 1924, in regard to the desire of the Swiss Government
                            that American consular officers shall continue, pending the
                            establishment of diplomatic relations between Switzerland and Egypt, the
                            representation of Swiss interests in the last-named country.</p>
                        <p>In reply, you may inform the Government of Switzerland that American
                            consular officers in Egypt will continue the representation of Swiss
                            interests but that this Government will be glad to be informed of the
                            establishment of Swiss diplomatic relations with Egypt in order that
                            American consular officers may be relieved of their duties in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>It may be stated that one of the principal difficulties in connection
                            with the representation of Swiss interests is found in the fact that the
                            consular officers of other governments are also representing Swiss <pb n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0802"/>interests in Egypt, and that
                            there occurs from time to time a conflict of authority which it is
                            desired to avoid if possible. Furthermore, it becomes possible through
                            this dual representation for Swiss citizens to apply at different
                            consular offices for the same service, thus causing confusion and
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is necessary to remind the Government of Switzerland that
                            American consular officers are not permitted to exercise judicial
                            authority in extraterritorial countries on behalf of the nationals of
                            other governments. It is understood that the French consular officers in
                            Egypt will exercise such authority only on behalf of Swiss citizens who
                            are registered in their offices. British martial law in Egypt, under
                            which British consular courts exercised jurisdiction over Swiss
                            citizens, was withdrawn in July, 1923, and it has subsequently been held
                            by the British Consul at Cairo that his jurisdiction over German-Swiss
                            nationals automatically ceased at the time of such withdrawal. The
                            German-Swiss, therefore, have no consular jurisdiction to which they may
                            appeal unless they register with the French or Italian consulates. As
                            appeal to the various consular courts in extraterritorial countries is a
                            general right which all capitulatory nations have jealously upheld and
                            as the Swiss have indirectly enjoyed such privilege, it is believed that
                            an unfortunate effect would result from the consequent dependence of
                            Swiss citizens not registered at the French or Italian consulates upon
                            native Egyptian criminal jurisdiction, it being understood, of course
                            that, in civil matters, such persons would remain subject to the Mixed
                            Courts. It is feared that the trial by native Egyptian criminal courts
                            of Swiss nationals registered in American consulates would have an
                            unfortunate effect not only on these persons, but also upon the general
                            subject of capitulatory rights in Egypt and it appears, therefore, for
                            this further reason that American consular officers should relinquish
                            the protection of Swiss interests in that country. As previously
                            indicated in this communication, the continued representation, so far as
                            is practicable, of Swiss interests is being authorized, but these
                            additional facts are being brought to the attention of the Government of
                            Switzerland for its further consideration of the matter and for such
                            additional comments thereupon as it may desire to make.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of instructions from the Swiss Government to the contrary,
                            the American consular officers in Egypt are being instructed to transmit
                            to the Treasury of the United States such fees as they may have
                            collected for services on behalf of Swiss nationals.</p>

                            <p>“<hi rend="italic">The Near East, Turkey.</hi>—Let me now direct your
                                attention to affairs in the Near East. The events of the past few
                                years have created a new situation, and the difficulty in clarifying
                                present problems is largely due to the fact that so many of our
                                people discuss them in terms which belong to the past. While there
                                was some consideration of Turkish questions in 1919, and certain
                                inquiries were prosecuted, it was not until 1920, after the Austrian
                                and Bulgarian treaties had been disposed of, that the Allies
                                definitely took up the Turkish treaty. This treaty, called the
                                treaty of Sevres,<note n="3" xml:id="d624fn3"><hi rend="italic">British and Foreign State Papers</hi>, 1920, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">cxiii</hi>, p. 652.</note> was signed in
                                August of that year. Its terms were severer than those of the
                                European peace treaties, not only depriving the Turks of vast
                                territories but imposing upon them an even greater measure of
                                foreign control than had been the case before the war. In spite,
                                however, of the Allied occupation of Constantinople, the Greek
                                occupation of Smyrna and its hinterland, and the French occupation
                                of Cilicia, the Turks refused to ratify the treaty. The Allies were
                                not in a position to compel them to do so.</p>
                            <p>As one of the results of the Great War, a new spirit of nationalism
                                and a desire for freedom from outside control had made itself felt
                                in the Near East. Nowhere had the evangel of self-determination <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0804"/>found a more eager
                                response. The nationalistic movement was particularly significant in
                                Turkey. That this movement had often been accompanied by violence is
                                not to be wondered at, although it is nonetheless to be regretted.
                                The outcome of the movement in Turkey was the establishment of a
                                government which claimed the right to be dealt with as sovereign and
                                which by its military achievements made good that claim.</p>
                            <p>As early as January, 1920, the so-called Turkish National Pact had
                                been voted by the Ottoman Parliament which was then assembled at
                                Constantinople. This pact set forth the aspirations of the Turks and
                                later was adopted by the National Assembly at Angora as summarizing
                                the object of the Turkish Nationalist movement. Among its provisions
                                was the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Article VI</hi>. ‘It is a fundamental
                                        condition of our life and continued existence that we, like
                                        every country, should enjoy complete independence and
                                        liberty in the matter of assuring the means of our
                                        development, in order that our national and economic
                                        development should be rendered possible and that it should
                                        be possible to conduct affairs in the form of a more
                                        up-to-date regular administration.</p>
                                    <p>‘For this reason we are opposed to restrictions inimical to
                                        our development in political, judicial, financial, and other
                                        matters.’</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>In March, 1921, the Allied Powers clearly appreciated that it would
                                be impossible, short of armed allied military intervention in
                                Turkey, to impose the treaty of Sèvres. It would seem that at no
                                time was such armed allied intervention seriously considered,
                                although from time to time certain of the Allied Powers gave a
                                measure of support to the Greek forces in the hope that the latter
                                would be able, through their victory over the Turks, to make
                                possible the realization of the Sevres treaty at least in part.
                                There were unsuccessful attempts to revise the treaty. At last the
                                total defeat of the Greek forces and the withdrawal of the Greek
                                Army from Anatolia completely changed the situation to the advantage
                                of Turkey and effected the elimination of the treaty of Sèvres as a
                                basis for negotiation. A victorious Turkish Army being in complete
                                control of Anatolia and threatening Constantinople, the Allied
                                Powers intervened to bring about an armistice between Greece and
                                Turkey which was signed at Mudania in October, 1922. The Lausanne
                                conferences of 1922 and 1923 followed.</p>
                            <p>The Allies frankly recognized that the situation of 1918 no longer
                                existed and that after the stubborn resistance of the Turks,
                                culminating in their recapture of Smyrna, it was impossible to
                                dictate the terms of peace. A treaty was therefore negotiated in
                                which the Turks ceded very considerable territories and for the
                                first time in their history agreed to open the Straits not only to
                                merchant ships but to foreign warships, but in which the Allies, on
                                the other hand, agreed to renounce their historic capitulatory
                                rights in Turkey.</p>
                            <p>In 1919 and 1920 the question was directly presented to the
                                Government of the United States as to the nature and extent of its
                                participation in the political and territorial readjustments of the
                                Near East. At that time the spokesmen for the Allied Powers at Paris
                                suggested that the United States assume a mandate for Constantinople
                                and Armenia. The formal proposal was never presented for the
                                consideration of the Congress, as it was clear as early as 1919 that
                                the American people would not favor the assumption of a man <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0805"/>date over Constantinople,
                                which, would immediately and directly involve this Government in one
                                of the most vexing political and territorial problems of the
                                world—the storm center of historic rivalries and bitter
                                contests.</p>
                            <p>When the question of an American [<hi rend="italic">Armenian</hi>]
                                mandate was formally presented in 1920 as a result of the action of
                                the Allied representatives meeting at San Remo, the Congress
                                declined to sanction it. It thus again became apparent that the
                                United States Government was not prepared to intervene in Near
                                Eastern affairs to the extent of assuming any obligations of a
                                territorial character. This course was in accord with our
                                traditional policy. The United States had taken no part in the
                                Turkish settlements which were embodied in the treaties of Paris in
                                1856, of Berlin in 1878, or in those which followed the Balkan Wars
                                of 1912 and 1913. Even during the World War we did not declare war
                                on Turkey or take the initiative in breaking relations with that
                                country, notwithstanding the serious provocation, from a
                                humanitarian standpoint, of the extensive Armenian deportations.
                                Presumably it was felt that the policy then adopted was better
                                calculated to enable the United States to exert its influence and to
                                protect its interests so long as this country was not to join the
                                military operations on the Near Eastern front.</p>
                            <p>If there ever was a time when we could have successfully intervened
                                and have backed up our intervention by armed forces, it was early in
                                1919 when we had a large army abroad and were in a position to
                                prosecute such a policy if deemed advisable. But this opportunity
                                passed. It should be added that, contrary to an impression which is
                                somewhat widespread in this country, this Government, while it has
                                always exerted its influence in a humanitarian way, has not assumed
                                political obligations with respect to the Armenians or other
                                Christian minorities in the Near East. Treaties concluded by other
                                powers undertook, however, to deal with such questions. This
                                Government took no part in the negotiation of the treaty of
                                Sèvres.</p>
                            <p>Such, then, was the situation prior to the year 1921. In developing
                                our relations with the Near East subsequently, it was necessary to
                                take into account the established policy of the Government and at
                                the same time to serve American interests and humanitarian ends. It
                                should also be remembered that a large part of the distress in the
                                Near East has been caused by encouraging action which failed of
                                adequate support. At various times the Armenians and Greeks have
                                been encouraged to take up arms, later to be left to their own
                                devices. This Government, however, would not be justified in
                                promoting such a policy on the part of others which it was not
                                prepared itself adequately to sustain. It has no mandate from the
                                people to intervene by arms and thus to impose by force a solution
                                of the problems of the Near East. And, for this very reason, it
                                could not essay the role of a dictator in order to determine how
                                others should solve these problems.</p>
                            <p>This, however, did not prevent this country from cooperating in a
                                spirit of helpfulness and from bringing, as it has brought, its
                                moral influence to aid in dealing with a situation of the utmost
                                difficulty. This influence was brought to bear at the Lausanne
                                Conference, where the efforts of the American representatives
                                undoubtedly contributed in no small degree to the final agreement
                                upon provisions <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0806"/>regarding
                                the protection of minorities, the recognition of charitable,
                                educational, and philanthropic institutions, the appointment of
                                judicial advisers and the maintenance of equality of opportunity. As
                                I have said, a state of war had not existed between the United
                                States and Turkey, and the course of events following the German War
                                had reaffirmed the historic policy of refraining from intervention
                                in political and territorial readjustments. Turkey had Fevered
                                diplomatic relations with us in 1917, however, and these had not
                                been resumed. But the formal conclusion of peace between the Allies
                                and Turkey, entailing as it would the resumption of full diplomatic
                                and consular relations, would leave the United States, unless
                                appropriate action were taken, in a relatively disadvantageous
                                position. Accordingly, negotiations were undertaken between American
                                and Turkish representatives which resulted in the treaty of amity
                                and commerce and the extradition treaty signed on August 6
                                    last.<note n="4" xml:id="d624fn4"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_1153"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            <p>The treaty of amity and commerce followed very closely the Allied
                                treaty without its territorial, political, and financial features.
                                The United States gained the same general rights and privileges as
                                the Allies, including the freedom of the Straits, and like the
                                Allies consented to the abrogation of the capitulations, that is, of
                                the exercise of the ex-territorial rights in Turkey which the Turks
                                regarded as in derogation of their sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>In making this important decision the American representatives were
                                obliged to take account of the following considerations. It was
                                quite apparent that the only basis upon which negotiations could be
                                conducted was that of most-favored-nation treatment and reciprocity.
                                Either the Turks were to be dealt with on this footing or not at
                                all. In these circumstances three courses were open to us: (1) To
                                compel the Turks by force to give us better terms than the Allies;
                                (2) not to negotiate at all; or (3) to negotiate with the Turks on
                                equal terms as with a State enjoying an unqualified sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>The first course was out of the question. However desirable the
                                maintenance of ex-territorial rights hitherto enjoyed might be, it
                                was obvious that the public opinion of this country would not
                                countenance a war for the purpose of maintaining them. Neither did
                                it appear to be practicable to forego negotiations, in an attempt to
                                maintain the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>. After the armistice
                                of 1918, we sent to Constantinople a high commissioner, with a naval
                                detachment under his command, and in spite of his unofficial status
                                in relation to the Turkish authorities he has succeeded in affording
                                American interests appropriate protection. But this anomalous
                                situation could not continue indefinitely. When the treaty of peace
                                between the Allies and Turkey comes into effect, and diplomatic and
                                consular officials of the Allied Powers return to Turkey, we should
                                find ourselves in an extremely difficult position if action
                                meanwhile had not been taken to regularize our own position, and in
                                the absence of a treaty American interests in Turkey would be
                                without adequate safeguards. In this event, the humanitarian
                                interests which are closest to the American heart would suffer. It
                                was also perfectly clear that <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0807"/>no period of waiting would avail to secure for us
                                ex-territorial rights which on their part the Allies
                                surrendered.</p>
                            <p>In these circumstances, the only practicable course was to negotiate
                                a treaty as with a fully sovereign State. If such a treaty falls
                                short of expectations, especially in that it acquiesces in the
                                abrogation of the capitulations, it should not be forgotten that the
                                only way to maintain the capitulations was to fight for them. It
                                should also be borne in mind (1) that the Lausanne treaty is such a
                                treaty as would be negotiated with any other sovereign state, (2)
                                that it gives us the same rights as other countries will enjoy under
                                the new regime, and (3) that by regularizing our relations with
                                Turkey, now interrupted for nearly seven years, it will provide
                                safeguards for American educational, philanthropic, and commercial
                                interests in Turkey.</p>
                            <p>Let me emphasize a further point. At no stage in the negotiations was
                                the American position determined by the so-called Chester
                                concession. This had been granted before negotiations of our treaty
                                with Turkey had been begun. This Government took no part in securing
                                it; this Government made no barter of any of its rights for this or
                                any other concession. Our position is a simple one. We maintain the
                                policy of the open door or equality of commercial opportunity; we
                                demand a square deal for our nationals. We objected to the alleged
                                concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company owned by foreign
                                interests because it had never been validly granted, and in so doing
                                we stood for American rights generally and not for any particular
                                interest. Opening the door for American nationals we give them
                                impartial and appropriate diplomatic support in the assertion of
                                what appear to be their legal rights, but without otherwise
                                involving this Government.</p>
                            <p>During the course of our recent negotiations, the Department of State
                                was in frequent consultation with those whose interests in Turkey it
                                is its privilege and duty properly to protect, particularly those
                                whose humanitarian enterprises have long been established. They have
                                clearly indicated their accord with the position that the present
                                situation in Turkey should be frankly faced and that the Turkish
                                authorities should have an opportunity to show that their expressed
                                desire for American friendship and help and their willingness to
                                protect American interests are sincere. It is on this basis that our
                                policy toward Turkey is being developed. Let it be understood that
                                Turkey, while insistent upon unqualified sovereign rights, does not
                                reject the international obligations which are correlative to such
                                rights. Let it also be appreciated that Turkey is not endeavoring to
                                undermine our institutions, to penetrate our labor organizations by
                                pernicious propaganda, and to foment disorder and conspiracies
                                against our domestic peace in the interest of a world
                                revolution.</p>
                            <p>No one is more competent to speak on the subject of the treaty than
                                Dr. James L. Barton, secretary of the American Board of
                                Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Permit me to quote from his
                                recent letter (November 24, 1923): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>‘To say that I have followed with keen interest the making of
                                        this treaty and its fate up to the present time is to
                                        express but mildly my own feeling as well as the feeling of
                                        the American Board and its friends. While the treaty does
                                        not contain all that we would like, yet I am sure I express
                                        the judgment of the <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0808"/>officers of the American Board and, so far as I know, the
                                        missionaries both on the field and here at home when I say
                                        that it is our earnest hope that the treaty will be ratified
                                        by the Senate and that without acrimonious debate. We are
                                        convinced that this is the best treaty that could be secured
                                        under the circumstances, but that it will furnish a basis
                                        for negotiations and for securing privileges not covered in
                                        the treaty.</p>
                                    <p>‘If the treaty should be rejected, I am convinced that the
                                        continuance of American institutions in Turkey, with their
                                        large invested interests, would be jeopardized. Under the
                                        treaty there are grounds for believing that they will be
                                        permitted to continue. I refer to educational, religious,
                                        medical, industrial, and philanthropic enterprises hitherto
                                        carried on by Americans, representing large American
                                        investments in Turkey. There are indications that the
                                        Government will look with increasing favor upon the
                                        continuation of these institutions and grant them enlarging
                                        privileges. This has already taken place in Smyrna, Tarsus,
                                        and at some other points.’</p>

                            <p>Let me add to this the statement of the distinguished educator, Dr.
                                Caleb F. Gates, president of Robert College of Constantinople: After
                                referring to the views of objectors, he says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>‘Let us ask for a moment why it is that we have not made a
                                        treaty more in conformity with the wishes of so many of the
                                        American people. Is it because the American representatives
                                        were not skillful and allowed themselves to be outwitted by
                                        the Turks? The American representatives acquitted themselves
                                        exceedingly well; they gained the respect of their opponents
                                        as well as of the representatives of the Allied Powers. They
                                        came out of the conference with a reputation enhanced by the
                                        ability and fairness they had shown, and they gained for
                                        their country fully as much as the representatives of the
                                        Allied Powers gained for theirs. … The Turks were determined
                                        to become sovereign in their own domain, and they were
                                        willing and prepared to fight in order to obtain this
                                        sovereignty while the Allies were not. Even those Americans
                                        who now denounce this treaty as unsatisfactory were
                                        determined that their country should not go to war over
                                        these questions. … It is the only kind of a treaty which
                                        could have been made under the circumstances, when one party
                                        knew exactly what they wanted and were ready to fight to
                                        obtain it, and the other party was not willing to fight, but
                                        still wished to retain the former conditions. … As to the
                                        treaty itself, what does it give to us? It gives the good
                                        will of the Turks instead of their ill will. That is
                                        certainly worth something to all who live and work in
                                        Turkey. To them the treaty affords an opportunity to work
                                        out the problems which their life in Turkey presents and to
                                        exercise what influence they may possess in favor of the
                                        right. It still leaves an opportunity for missionaries and
                                        educators to try to make the principles of righteousness
                                        known and practiced in Turkey and it gives to business men a
                                        field for their legitimate activities. … The schools and
                                        colleges established by Americans are carrying on their work
                                        and many of those that had been closed are reopening.’</p>

                            <p>In order to accord adequate protection to American interests in the
                                Near East during the period following the Great War, the Department
                                of State has maintained its representatives throughout this area and
                                a naval force has been stationed in Near Eastern waters since 1919.
                                Until October, 1922, this force consisted of from three to nine
                                destroyers with various other craft from time to time. When news was
                                received of the Smyrna disaster 12 additional destroyers were
                                immediately dispatched, arriving in Turkish waters during October of
                                that year. These vessels have been of inestimable service to the
                                representatives of the Department of State and to all American
                                interests in the Near East. Through their radio they have furnished
                                communication when no other means were available. They have
                                transported American missionaries, philanthropists, relief workers,
                                and business men, saving days and weeks of time when no other
                                adequate means of transportation were available. They have assisted
                                in the evacuation of refugees and they have been instrumental <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0809"/>in serving manifold
                                humanitarian purposes. It is a pleasure to commend the admirable
                                work that has been performed by the officers and men of these
                                vessels.</p>

                            following observations concerning the part played by this Government in
                            the Conference of Lausanne and concerning the circumstances in which the
                            negotiations between the American and Turkish representatives at that
                            Conference were initiated and conducted.</p>
                        <p>The United States, though never at war with Turkey, was deeply interested
                            in the settlement of the problems growing out of the war between Turkey
                            and the Powers with which this country was associated in the war against
                            the Central Powers. Upon the invitation of the Allied Governments, the
                            United States was accordingly represented at the Lausanne Conference but
                            was not a party to the Treaty of Peace or other instruments concluded
                            between the Allied Powers and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>During the first phase of the Conference, which extended from November
                            20, 1922, to February 4, 1923, the three representatives of the United
                            States, as occasion arose, expressed the views of this Government upon
                            questions affecting American interests. They pointed <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0810"/>out the vital importance of the
                            adoption by Turkey of a policy calculated to reassure foreigners
                            concerning the administration of justice. They urged that recognition
                            and protection be accorded by the Turkish authorities to American
                            missions, schools, and hospitals in Turkey. They supported the principle
                            of the “Open Door” and the equality of economic opportunity. They
                            advocated freedom of navigation and passage through the Straits and
                            associated themselves heartily with the representatives of the Allied
                            Powers in impressing upon the Turkish Government the necessity of
                            agreeing to adequate measures for the protection of the non-Turkish
                            minorities in Turkish territory and for the extension to such minorities
                            of the rights and privileges believed to be essential to their
                            well-being.</p>
                        <p>During the first phase of the Conference agreement was reached between
                            the Allies and Turks with regard to many important features of the peace
                            settlement, but as there was lack of accord on certain points at issue,
                            an adjournment took place, during which the Turkish delegates returned
                            to Angora to ascertain the views of the Grand National Assembly. The
                            second phase of the Conference, which began on April 23, 1923,
                            terminated on July 24, 1923, with the signature of a treaty of peace and
                            several other instruments, including a commercial convention, a
                            convention regarding residence, business, and jurisdiction, and a
                            convention relating to the regime of the Straits. Copies of these
                            instruments are enclosed for your information (Enclosure 2).<note n="9" xml:id="d625fn9">Enclosures not printed. Texts of agreements signed

                        <p>The arrangements thus concluded provided for the acceptance by the Allied
                            Powers of the complete abolition of the Capitulations from every point
                            of view. The Turkish Government, however, agreed for a period of five
                            years to certain limitations in matters of taxation and customs dues,
                            and it undertook for a period of seven years to permit all questions
                            involving the civil status of Allied nationals to be determined by
                            courts sitting within the territory of the countries to which such
                            nationals belonged. Certain assurances were, moreover, given by
                            declaration in regard to the employment of legal advisers to collaborate
                            in the administration of justice as it affects foreigners in Turkey and
                            to assist in making reforms which might be deemed necessary to modernize
                            the administration of justice, as well as in regard to the execution of
                            awards made upon the voluntary arbitration of controversies concerning
                            civil or commercial matters.</p>
                        <p>The status of Allied charitable, educational, and philanthropic
                            institutions in Turkey was dealt with in a letter addressed by the
                            Turkish representatives to the British, French, and Italian Delegations
                                <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0811"/>at Lausanne, and in the
                            convention relating to the régime of the Straits recognition was given
                            to the principle of the freedom of navigation and passage for commercial
                            vessels and aircraft and war vessels and aircraft both in time of peace
                            and in time of war, subject to certain limitations in the case of war
                            vessels and to certain restrictions in the event of Turkey or the
                            country to which the vessels or aircraft belong being engaged in the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The Treaty of Peace incorporated provisions assuring to the non-Moslem
                            minorities in Turkey, among other rights or privileges, the full and
                            complete protection of life and property; the free exercise of creed,
                            religion, or belief; freedom of movement and of emigration; equality
                            with Moslems in civil and political rights; the right to maintain
                            charitable, religious, social and scholastic institutions and to use
                            their own language and exercise their own religion therein; and the
                            right to determine questions of personal status and domestic relations
                            in accordance with their own usages. These provisions the Turks
                            undertook to recognize as fundamental laws. Representatives of the
                            United States who were present at the meetings of the committee which
                            framed and adopted these provisions, played an important part in their
                            elaboration.</p>
                        <p>In the second phase of the Conference at Lausanne the Government of the
                            United States was represented by the American Minister to Switzerland,
                            the Honorable Joseph C. Grew. Shortly after the beginning of this phase
                            of the Conference Mr. Grew was approached by Ismet Pasha, the head of
                            the Turkish Delegation, with the suggestion that a new treaty should be
                            made between the United States and Turkey. In response to inquiries as
                            to the basis upon which the Turkish Delegation envisaged the making of a
                            new treaty, Ismet Pasha stated that a new treaty or treaties should be,
                            in general, upon the fully reciprocal basis which he regarded as alone
                            compatible with the sovereignty of Turkey and the changed conditions in
                            the country, but that Turkey was prepared to grant to the United States
                            any privilege which she granted to any other Power.</p>
                        <p>The negotiations which followed between the American and Turkish
                            Delegations at Lausanne resulted in the conclusion of the treaties of
                            August 6, 1923 which are now before the Committee on Foreign Relations.
                            By way of general observation, I may state that these treaties are in
                            essential respects of the same character as the treaties usually
                            concluded concerning similar matters between the United States and other
                            sovereign States. As will appear from the parallel summaries which I
                            attach (Enclosure 3),<note n="10" xml:id="d625fn10">Not printed.</note>
                            the provisions of the new treaties are much more detailed and definite
                            than those of the Treaty <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0812"/>of

                            Empire.</p>
                        <p>The provisions concerning the capitulatory régime in the treaty of
                            general relations merit further comment. Many of the rights enjoyed by
                            foreigners in Turkey under the capitulations were such as are enjoyed by
                            foreigners in other countries under international law or under treaties
                            of a reciprocal character. To the maintenance of such rights the Turkish
                            Government had no objection, as is evidenced by the fact that in the
                            Treaty of Peace and other instruments concluded with the Allies at
                            Lausanne, as well as in the treaty with the United States, the Turkish
                            representatives readily agreed to the introduction of provisions of a
                            reciprocal character granting to foreigners the right to enter and
                            establish themselves in Turkey, subject to the observance of the laws
                            and regulations in force therein, and assuring to them the most constant
                            protection and security for their persons and their property in
                            accordance with generally recognized international law. The special
                            privileges, of a juridical and economic character, conferred upon
                            foreigners by the Capitulations were, however, considered by the Turkish
                            Government to be burdensome and unfair.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish National Pact which was adopted on January 28, 1920 and which
                            was stated by the Turkish Government before the convening of the
                            Lausanne Conference to embody the conditions upon which alone a durable
                            peace could be made, contained a declaration that the restrictions
                            imposed upon Turkey by the Capitulations could no longer be tolerated.
                            In the negotiations with the Allies at Lausanne the Turkish
                            representatives steadfastly adhered to that declaration. The result of
                            the negotiations between the Turks and the Allies with reference to the
                            Capitulations has already been noted. The negotiations between the
                            United States and Turkey could have been conducted on no other basis
                            than the agreement of this country to take towards the Capitulations an
                            attitude similar to that adopted by the other Powers in dealing with
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The treaties which I am transmitting to you were supplemented by
                            assurances in a formal communication to Mr. Grew from Ismet Pasha
                            regarding the recognition and protection of American educational,
                            charitable, and philanthropic institutions in Turkey.<note n="13" xml:id="d625fn13">Note of Aug. 4 and its enclosure, <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_1141"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            In substance the communication provides that such American institutions
                            as had been recognized prior to October 30, 1914 shall continue to be
                            recognized and that the situation of such of them as have been
                            established subsequently shall be favorably examined. This communication
                            was transmitted with the treaties.</p>
                        <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0813"/>
                        <p>On the date of the signature of the treaties Ismet Pasha formally
                            communicated to Mr. Grew copies of the declarations of the Turkish
                            Delegation regarding the administration of justice and regarding
                            sanitary affairs in Turkey. Copies of these declarations and
                            translations thereof, with a copy and translation of the transmitting
                            letters, were also submitted with the Treaties.<note n="14" xml:id="d625fn14"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_1139"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, pp. 1139</ref>–<ref target="frus1923v02#pg_1141">1141</ref>.</note> The declarations
                            were made under authorization of the Grand National Assembly at Angora
                            and may doubtless be regarded as constituting international commitments.
                            It is believed that their formal communication to the American
                            representative was desirable in order to emphasize the interest of the
                            United States in the matters to which they relate.</p>
                        <p>A question which it was found impracticable to settle at Lausanne was
                            subsequently dealt with by an exchange of notes at Constantinople. This
                            was the question of the disposition of the pecuniary claims of American
                            citizens against Turkey. On the date of the signature of the treaties at
                            Lausanne this question was formally reserved by an exchange of notes of
                            which copies and translations are attached (Enclosure 4).<note n="15" xml:id="d625fn15"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_1143"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p. 1143</ref>.</note> In the
                            subsequent negotiations at Constantinople it became apparent that the
                            Turkish Government, having in mind the disturbed conditions of the last
                            fifteen years in Turkey, as well as the financial problems incidental to
                            the establishment of a new Government, was indisposed to make any formal
                            commitment regarding the final settlement of claims in advance of the
                            examination of the claims themselves. It was finally deemed to be the
                            most feasible method of procedure to effect an agreement by an exchange
                            of notes for the examination of all claims by a Mixed Committee which
                            will endeavor to determine the merits of the claims examined, and to
                            agree upon modes of settling such claims as may be deemed to possess
                            merit. Copies and translations of the notes on this subject exchanged at
                            Constantinople on December 24, 1923, between Rear Admiral Mark L.
                            Bristol, United States High Commissioner, and Dr. Adnan Bey,
                            Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of
                            Turkey, are attached (Enclosure 5).<note n="16" xml:id="d625fn16"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_1190"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, p.

                        <p>With reference to assurances regarding the treatment of minorities in
                            Turkey, I desire to recall the part played by representatives of the
                            United States in connection with the framing of the provisions regarding
                            minorities contained in the Allied Treaty with Turkey. The interest of
                            the United States in the welfare of the Minorities was appropriately
                            expressed at both phases of the Lausanne Conference. This Government,
                            however, in dealing with this subject has avoided the advocacy of
                            measures impossible of realization by methods short of war or of
                            measures which would only be calculated to make more <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0814"/>difficult the reaching of adjustments
                            between the Minorities and the authorities in control of the country. In
                            the long run the protection of Minorities has rarely been furthered by
                            foreign interference on their behalf and often the result of such
                            interference has been quite the opposite of that sought to be achieved.
                            Further, in this connection it was necessary to give consideration to
                            the traditional policy of the United States against intervention in
                            behalf of the nationals of other countries or the assumption of treaty
                            obligations in such matters.</p>
                        <p>It is my deliberate opinion, predicated upon a careful consideration of
                            the situation in Turkey, that the rights and activities of American
                            citizens in that country can best be protected through the adoption of
                            the new treaties which, while consenting to the abrogation of the
                            Capitulations, assure to American citizens and concerns in Turkey rights
                            and privileges as great as those accorded to citizens and concerns of
                            any other Power in Turkey. Those who might be disposed to advocate an
                            attempt to maintain the pre-war status should remember that the rights
                            enjoyed by American citizens under the regime of the Capitulations were
                            for the most part specifically granted to other Powers and applied to
                            American citizens by virtue of most-favored-nation provisions in our
                            Treaty of 1830. The Powers concerned agreed at Lausanne to surrender
                            these capitulatory rights and the practical value of the Treaty of 1830
                            has therefore been seriously impaired. Unless we are willing to go to
                            war with Turkey, a persistence on our part in claiming capitulatory
                            rights formerly enjoyed would simply expose our Government to a series
                            of futile negotiations and would render most arduous, if not altogether
                            impossible, the continuance of the philanthropic, educational and
                            commercial activities of our citizens in Turkey; instead of the
                            substantial rights provided under the new treaties, this Government
                            would have no recourse but to illusory claims based on a regime which
                            the United States would be alone in endeavoring to maintain.</p>
                        <p>This is also the opinion of Americans at present actually engaged in such
                            activities in Turkey. These Americans, who will be most directly
                            affected by the new treaties and those interests were carefully borne in
                            mind throughout the negotiations at Lausanne, have expressed the view
                            that the results secured afford the only practicable basis for the
                            carrying on of their activities in Turkey under present conditions.</p>
                        <p>Before submitting the treaties to the Senate, which as you will note were
                            negotiated nine months ago, it was considered important, (1) to conclude
                            the negotiations with Turkey with reference to the formation of a
                            committee to consider outstanding claims between the two countries and
                            their nationals, (2) to ascertain the attitude of the Allied Powers
                            toward the treaty of peace concluded between those powers and Turkey at
                            Lausanne shortly before the signature of the <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0815"/>treaty between the United States and Turkey and (3) to
                            secure all available information as to whether the government with which
                            the United States had negotiated was willing and able to carry out its
                            international obligations.</p>
                        <p>With regard to these three points the first, the question of claims, has
                            already been dealt with in this letter. With reference to the attitude
                            of other powers towards Turkey I may state that Italy, Greece and
                            Rumania have ratified the treaty of peace between the Allied Powers and
                            Turkey. This treaty has been approved by the British Parliament and has
                            been favorably reported by the appropriate committee of the French
                            Chamber of Deputies and the French Senate. There is every reason to
                            believe therefore that the Allied Powers will establish peace with
                            Turkey at an early date on the basis of the agreements negotiated by
                            those Powers at Lausanne.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the Turkish Government has during the last nine months
                            maintained and consolidated its position is <hi rend="italic">prima
                                facie</hi> evidence of stability but to secure the latest
                            information, Admiral Bristol the American Representative in Turkey has
                            recently made a trip throughout Anatolia, visiting Angora, Konia,
                            Tarsus, Adana, Mersina and other points. According to his report the
                            Turkish Government is stable, is in control of the country and is
                            believed to be in a position to assume on behalf of Turkey, and to carry
                            out, international obligations.</p>
                        <p>Further, the constitutional changes which have taken place in Turkey
                            during the last nine months, the separation of church and state, the
                            adoption of a new constitution, and the establishment of a republic have
                            indicated a desire on the part of Turkey to modernize its institutions,
                            and thereby to facilitate an administration of law more in conformity
                            with western ideas of justice.</p>
                        <p>I have desired to set forth in this letter and its enclosures the
                            information which appeared to be necessary to an understanding of the

                            to the Lausanne <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0816"/>Treaty and the
                            so-called Chester concession. The treaties concluded with Turkey are now
                            before the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate together with the
                            information which I felt might be useful to the Committee in its
                            consideration of these instruments. I do not feel therefore that it
                            would be appropriate for me at this time to enter into any detailed
                            discussion of the various allegations contained in the statement
                            accompanying Senator King’s resolution. At the appropriate time and as
                            desired by the Foreign Relations Committee I shall be glad to give full
                            information with regard to any matters pertinent to the consideration of
                            these treaties.</p>
                        <p>Certain of the statements of Senator King are of such a character,
                            however, that I did not feel that I should allow them to pass unnoticed,
                            although their inaccuracy has been indicated in the information which I
                            have already laid before the Committee.</p>
                        <p>1. The charge “that the United States participated in the Lausanne
                            Conference apparently for the sole purpose of securing and confirming
                            the Chester oil concession and that in pursuance of that purpose, vested
                            and essential rights of American nationals in Turkey were sacrificed and
                            Armenia forsaken, if not betrayed,” is absolutely unfounded. As I stated
                            in January last, “At no stage in the negotiations was the American
                            position determined by the so-called Chester concession. This had been
                            granted before negotiations of our treaty with Turkey had been begun.
                            This Government took no part in securing it; this Government made no
                            barter of any of its rights for this or any other concession.”</p>
                        <p>Senator King in referring to the date of our negotiations with Turkey has
                            apparently confused the negotiations between the Allied Powers and
                            Turkey with the negotiations of the American Plenipotentiary at Lausanne
                            and the Turkish representatives. The latter negotiations were not
                            initiated until subsequent to May 1, 1923. While the United States was
                            represented at Lausanne during the earlier phases of the conference it
                            had not prior to May 1923 undertaken the negotiation of a Treaty.</p>
                        <p>2. Senator King contrasts the action of this Government in 1920 with
                            respect to the Sevres Treaty with that of 1923, indicating that there
                            was in 1923 a reversal of the earlier attitude toward Turkey. It is
                            possible that the Senator does not recall that the United States was
                            represented at the San Remo Conference in 1920, which had under
                            consideration the Treaty of Sevres, in the same capacity as at Lausanne.
                            The United States, however, was neither a party to the Treaty of Sevres
                            nor to the Lausanne Treaty of Peace between the Allied Powers and
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>3. In view of the fact that the reference in Senator King’s statement to
                            my memorandum of October 30, 1922, with regard to the Near Eastern
                            Settlement is inaccurate I beg to enclose a copy of the <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0817"/>full text of this memorandum which was
                            given to the Press at that time.<note n="18" xml:id="d626fn18">See
                                telegram no. 344, Oct. 27, 1922, to the Ambassador in France, <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_884"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            stood for the principles outlined in this memorandum and was able to
                            obtain substantial guarantees with respect to the points of interest
                            which this communication outlined.</p>
                        <p>4. Senator King states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Allies declined to make concessions to the Turks, both on
                                    the subject of the capitulations and upon the Armenian case. The
                                    conference was deadlocked largely upon these two points, and it
                                    was finally suspended on February 4, 1923.</p>
                                <p>“Meanwhile, on April 10, 1923, the crafty Turks ratified the
                                    Chester concession. The conference was resumed on April 23,
                                    1923, and the American observers, who, during the first session
                                    of the conference, had supported the Allies, whole-heartedly in
                                    some matters, half-heartedly in others, transferred their
                                    support in all matters to the Turks, with the result that the
                                    Turks were enabled to impose their views and will upon the
                                    Allies.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This statement is totally inaccurate. In the draft treaty of peace as
                            communicated to the Turks by the Allies on January 31, 1923 it is
                            provided in Article 26: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The High Contracting Parties agree to abrogate the capitulations
                                    relating to the regime of foreigners in Turkey both as regards
                                    conditions of entry and residence and as regards fiscal and
                                    judicial questions.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Thus prior to the adjournment of the Conference on February 4th, the
                            Allies had agreed to abrogate the capitulations. This was not one of the
                            points which brought about the interruption of the Conference. Nor was
                            the issue with respect to the Armenians instrumental in deadlocking the
                            Conference in February 1923 since the Turkish plenipotentiary had agreed
                            to the provisions of the Allied treaty as communicated on January 31,
                            which related to the protection of minorities. The statement that the
                            American representatives after the adjournment “transferred their
                            support in all matters to the Turks with the result that the Turks were
                            enabled to impose their views and will upon the Allies” is utterly
                            false.</p>
                        <p>5. In answer to the allegation that the treaty surrenders American rights
                            and interests I would call your attention to the fact that the Americans
                            who have interests in Turkey, whether philanthropic or commercial, have
                            urged its ratification.</p>
                        <p>6. Senator King’s remarks with regard to the status of American
                            philanthropic and missionary work in Turkey are both inaccurate and
                            misleading. In this connection it is significant that the Americans who
                            are responsible for carrying on this work in Turkey have <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0818"/>indicated their view that their work
                            could best be aided by the ratification of the treaty with Turkey and
                            have submitted encouraging reports of recent progress.</p>
                        <p>In case there are further points in Senator King’s statement on which the
                            Committee might desire to obtain additional information, I shall be most
                            happy to furnish it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Senator Borah</hi>: It is my understanding
                            that the Treaties concluded between the United States and Turkey on
                            August 6, 1923 are now before the Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>
                        <p>In a letter to the late Senator Lodge dated May 5th last, of which I
                            attach a copy,<note n="19" xml:id="d628fn19"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_715">p. 715</ref>.</note> I described
                            the negotiations which led up to the conclusions of these treaties and
                            outlined the considerations which led me to believe that American
                            interests would best be served by prompt ratification.</p>
                        <p>The events which have occurred during the past six months have confirmed
                            this view. During this period the treaties concluded by the Allied
                            Powers at Lausanne with the new Turkish Republic have been ratified and
                            have gone into effect and Turkey has negotiated additional treaties with
                            most of the other Powers of Europe. Further, since the date of my letter
                            to Senator Lodge Turkey has carried out substantial reforms in her
                            judicial organization and in administrative matters as provided for
                            under the new Constitution of the Turkish Republic of April 20,
                            1924.</p>
                        <p>American citizens who have interests in Turkey, whether of a
                            philanthropic, educational or commercial character, have consistently
                                <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0819"/>urged the early
                            ratification of the Treaties. It is now sixteen months since our treaty
                            with Turkey was signed at Lausanne and in view of recent developments
                            this Government will be at a serious disadvantage in safeguarding these
                            legitimate American interests unless early action is taken to regularize
                            our relations with that country. The Treaty of August 6th furnishes what
                            I consider to be an appropriate, and the only present available, basis
                            for so doing.</p>
                        <p>I should be very glad at any time to take up with you any phase of this
                            matter in greater detail or to lay before the Committee any information
                            which might be helpful in connection with the consideration of the
                            treaties with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>The matter is one which I consider to be of real urgency.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have your letter of
                            December 8th relative to the Treaties concluded between the United
                            States and Turkey on August 6, 1923.</p>
                        <p>I have already made some inquiry among the Members of the Committee
                            relative to taking up these Treaties. I find considerable opposition and
                            I doubt if we shall be able to do anything with them before the
                            holidays. I hope, however, to bring them up for consideration at the
                            next meeting after the session on Thursday.</p>
                        <p>I have not myself concluded my study of these Treaties and cannot express
                            a view, but I am thoroughly in sympathy with the proposition of
                            disposing of them. I see no reason why longer delay should be had.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully,</p>

                        <p>232. Minister of Foreign Affairs intimated informally day before
                            yesterday to delegate at Angora that our treaties would not be presented
                            to Assembly for ratification until our Senate had ratified or at least
                            seemed to be on the point of ratifying them. It would be most helpful if
                            I could have exact present status of treaties before Senate.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: As you will recall, the
                            Treaty concluded on August 6, 1923, between the United States and Turkey
                            was transmitted by you to the Senate during the last session of Congress
                            and was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, but did not come up
                            for consideration prior to the Senate’s adjournment.</p>
                        <p>Since the submission of this Treaty to the Senate the treaties concluded
                            by the Allied Powers with Turkey at Lausanne have been ratified and
                            formal diplomatic relations have been resumed by these Powers as well as
                            by many of the other Powers of Europe which have also concluded treaties
                            with the new Turkish Government. In view of this situation it has become
                            increasingly important that this Government should secure a proper basis
                            upon which to protect American interests in Turkey through early
                            ratification of our Treaty.</p>
                        <p>I have brought this situation briefly to the attention of Senator Borah,
                            who has replied that while he finds considerable opposition to the
                            Turkish Treaty he hopes to bring it up for early consideration.</p>
                        <p>While the United States never declared war on Turkey we have had no
                            formal diplomatic or consular relations with that country since April
                            1917, and the present Treaty has been negotiated for the purpose of
                            facilitating the resumption of relations on a secure basis, taking into
                            account the changes which have resulted from the events of the past
                            seven years. The Treaty is, in effect, the last of the series of
                            treaties we have negotiated with the Central Powers to regularize the
                            situation resulting from the World War. Under this Treaty we secure
                            substantially all the privileges which the Allies obtained under their
                            peace settlement with Turkey, but without incurring the political
                            obligations relating to the Near East which those Powers have
                            assumed.</p>
                        <p>We can hardly expect to receive more favorable treatment than the Allied
                            Powers. In fact, I do not believe that it would be conducive to friendly
                            international relations or consistent with our general policy to
                            endeavor to secure a regime of special privileges in Turkey. The Turks
                            have indicated their willingness and desire for friendly relations with
                            the United States. American citizens who have interests in Turkey have
                            very emphatically indicated the importance which they place upon the
                            early ratification of the Treaty. If ratification should be unduly
                            delayed we would have to face the possibility that the Turkish
                            Government would not extend indefinitely to the United States the
                            benefits of the regime which other Powers have <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0821"/>secured by treaty. In fact, two cases
                            have already arisen in which the Turkish authorities have declined to
                            extend to American citizens the privileges secured to nationals of the
                            Allied powers under their treaty settlement with Turkey. I cannot view
                            without very serious concern the situation in which this Government
                            would be placed with respect to the protection of American interests in
                            Turkey in the event that the present anomalous situation should be
                            continued for any great length of time.</p>
                        <p>I venture to bring this matter to your attention in the hope that you may
                            deem it proper, should the occasion be presented, to emphasize to
                            members of the Senate the importance of early action on the Turkish
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In the event that you should desire to have available further information
                            on the subject of the Treaty, I enclose with this letter a copy of a
                            communication which I addressed to the late Senator Lodge on May 5,
                                1924,<note n="20" xml:id="d631fn20"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I want to call your
                            attention to the importance, from the viewpoint of American commerce, of
                            the prompt ratification of the treaty with Turkey, concluded at Lausanne
                            on August 6, 1923. Whatever differences of opinion there may have been
                            with regard to the desirability of the major changes of a noncommercial
                            character involved in the treaty, it appears that the broad alterations
                            in the political and legal relations and powers of the Turkish
                            Government are now accomplished facts, the original treaty of July 24,
                            1923, between the Allied Powers and Turkey having been ratified by the
                            governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, Rumania, and
                            Greece, and actually brought into operation.</p>
                        <p>Since the treaty between Turkey and the United States consists
                            essentially of an exchange of assurances of most-favored-nation
                            treatment, there are involved no specific new obligations upon the
                            United States, but until a treaty with Turkey is ratified by the United
                            States, the benefits of any concessions or privileges established by
                            Turkey in <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0822"/>favor of any of the
                            treaty countries under the new régime may be denied to the United States
                            and its nationals. In fact, a tariff discrimination has already been
                            established, through an order issued by the Angora Government to its
                            customs officials on October 9, putting into effect as from August 6 the
                            provisions of the Lausanne Commercial Convention granting reduced import
                            duties on certain products from the treaty countries. The benefits of
                            these concessions are not being extended to similar products from the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>I inclose copy of a report on the situation received from Trade
                            Commissioner Gillespie at Constantinople,<note n="22" xml:id="d632fn22">Not printed.</note> and would call your particular attention to the
                            statement that he has investigated and found correct the complaints,
                            brought to his attention by a local merchant who had endeavored to
                            import leather from the United States, that “because the United States
                            has not ratified the treaty negotiated with Turkey at Lausanne on August
                            23 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>], 1923, the importation of American leather
                            into Turkey at the present time is virtually prohibited, in view of the
                            discriminatory attitude of the Turkish Government.” A note of protest
                            against this situation presented to the Turkish Government has thus far
                            received no reply.</p>
                        <p>The particular difficulty in the case of leather has also been brought to
                            our attention through recent inquiries from several prominent American
                            leather exporters, whether they could possibly obtain a certificate of
                            origin through the Turkish consul at London for transshipment of their
                            merchandise to Turkey. While a certificate of British origin naturally
                            can not be obtained on American goods, the fact that an extreme
                            alternative of this sort is being considered is significant of the
                            difficulty in which that trade finds itself. American exporters of wheat
                            flour and of edible oils, trades formerly of considerable volume, have
                            for some time been complaining of the tariff treatment of their products
                            in Turkey, but I understand that it has not been possible to approach
                            the Turkish Government in these matters until there had been recognition
                            in the form of a treaty.</p>
                        <p>Should the disposition of this treaty be postponed until the next session
                            of Congress, a year hence, increasing handicaps may be imposed on
                            American commerce with Turkey through the establishment of preferential
                            duties or other privileges, which it would be later more difficult to
                            remove than now to anticipate through a treaty assuring the United
                            States automatically of most-favored-nation treatment.</p>
                        <p>There is involved in this situation not only the trade with Turkey, but
                            with all the areas surrounding the Black Sea, for one of the important
                            provisions embodied in the original treaty, which is extended <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0823"/>freely and without obligation
                            to the United States by our treaty, is the assurance to ships of treaty
                            nations of the freedom of the straits, through which vessels for Black
                            Sea ports must pass. The interests of our shipping as well as our trade,
                            therefore, make desirable the early ratification of the treaty with
                            Turkey in the form essentially as concluded.</p>

                        <p>71. Following message received from Admiral Bristol who is in Anatolia:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I visited Angora from April 7 to 13. Representative of Foreign
                                    Office met me and, during my entire stay, I was cordially
                                    received by Turkish officials. I had a long conference April 6
                                    with Ismet Pasha in which we discussed in a general way American
                                    and Turkish interests with respect to business and benevolent
                                    institutions. I conferred with the President of the Assembly,
                                    Fethi Bey, and attended a session of the Assembly. By
                                    appointment I conferred with Ministers of Finance, Interior,
                                    Education, and Health. I discussed in these conferences the
                                    great necessity of having all present and future issues settled
                                    by investigation and on the principle of a square deal from the
                                    Government without such arbitrary actions as the closing of
                                    institutions thus adversely affecting public opinion in the
                                    United States. I believe the relations which I have established
                                    will in the future facilitate the protection of American
                                    interests.</p>

                        <p>The Department is considering submitting this treaty to the Senate soon
                            and wishes your report so that before doing so it may have the benefit
                            of the observations which you made on your trip. You should <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0825"/>stress, of course, besides the above
                            points anything else which you believe should be considered by the

                        <p>The Department does not desire you at present, with reference to point 3,
                            to do anything which might be interpreted as urging ratification by the
                            Turks. When the situation has clarified here you will be given further
                            instructions on this point. However, you should report, with reference
                            to your telegram no. 71 of April 15, 11 a.m., any information you
                            receive as to time when Angora Assembly will probably adjourn.</p>

                                the medical department of Constantinople College was closed within a
                                week of my conversations with the Minister of Public Instruction and
                                with Ismet. [Garbled sentence omitted.] Marash school has been
                                refused permission to reopen. The Standard Oil Company has
                                encountered a series of obstacles. Difficulties have arisen
                                concerning the military transport tax. A resentment has been
                                produced among Americans, and even more markedly among other
                                foreigners, by the accumulation of such acts … However, Turkish
                                legislation has not become harmful to American interests. Also due
                                consideration should be given to the fact that certain outstanding
                                issues have recently been settled.</item>

                                months, however, as Assembly has recessed for that length of

                                learn the details through British Embassy in Washington or through
                                our Embassy in London.</item>

                            <item>I strongly favor submission of our treaties to the Senate at the
                                earliest really opportune moment and their ratification as soon as
                                    <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0826"/>possible. I hope to be
                                able to adjust the various matters referred to in my paragraph 1,
                                especially as Angora Ministers can give more time to such questions
                                now that the Assembly has recessed. I leave it to the judgment of
                                the Department whether the wiser course is to submit the treaties to
                                the Senate now with existing issues still unadjusted, or delay until
                                an effort to settle these issues has resulted one way or the other.
                                Due consideration should be given in this connection to the
                                possibility that new incidents or difficulties may arise.</item>

                        <p>92. My 81 of April 27, noon, which I assume Department has received,
                            answers your paragraph 1. With reference to your paragraph 2, my feeling
                            is that should the Senate ratify the treaty soon the effect would be to
                            give some added weight, at least, to representations by me concerning
                            treaty rights of Americans. I do not, however, believe that the
                            assistance which might be given this mission, pending ratification by
                            the Turkish Government, by such early ratification on our part, is
                            important enough to lead the Department to send the treaty to the Senate
                            before the Department considers such action to be opportune, in view of
                            the political situation in the United States. In my opinion it is
                            doubtful whether the rise of new incidents, such as those discussed in
                            my telegram no. 81 of April 27, noon, will be at all affected by the
                            ratification of our treaty. If the Senate, however, should ratify the
                            treaty before [adjournment?], I think prompt ratification by the Turkish
                            Assembly would be thus insured when it meets again on November 22, and,
                            in this way, the delay which would result if the treaty were not
                            ratified by the Senate before the opening of the next session in
                            December would be obviated.</p>
                        <p>Pending the ratification of the treaty there is no plan which I can
                            suggest to protect American interests other than the essentially
                            opportunist and defensive policy being now pursued. However, I urge that
                            the recommendation in my telegram 88 of April 30, 2 p.m.,<note n="24" xml:id="d637fn24">Not printed.</note> be accepted by the Department
                            and that the Department aid the Turkish Government in securing American
                                advisers.<note n="25" xml:id="d637fn25">The Department suggested

                                    Constantinople. On May 22, 1924, while on guard, he discharged
                                    his pistol, fatally wounding a Turk. The Navy board of inquiry
                                    found the shooting to be accidental. McCarthy was arrested by
                                    the Turkish authorities on a charge of murder and held in jail
                                    for about three weeks, after which he was released on bail. The
                                    United States claimed diplomatic immunity for McCarthy and
                                    demanded that the charge be withdrawn. This was refused.
                                    McCarthy forfeited bail and left Turkey without awaiting

                        <p>I have instructed Barnes to make categorical protests on the first two

                            that is necessary. At the same time I would like instructions as to just
                            how far I can go in informing Ismet of the consequences which will
                            result from the unfriendly attitude which apparently <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0828"/>the Turkish Government is intent upon
                            taking. It is my belief that it would not be of value to me to receive
                            detailed or mandatory instructions, but I should wish to be able, if I
                            find Ismet indifferent or hostile, to state with authority the extent to
                            which the American Government would be prepared to go, in addition to
                            remonstrating and placing diplomatic protests on record.</p>

                                    pending issues are being followed most closely, and that the
                                    attitude of the Turkish Government is making it most difficult
                                    to assist in placing our mutual relations on a satisfactory
                                    basis although we would welcome any opportunity to do so.</item>

                            meet Ismet of the various points at issue which you have outlined in
                            your telegram.</p>
                        <p>This telegram and your 148 of July 9 are being repeated to London for the
                            information of Secretary Hughes. Considering the short time he will be
                            abroad it is probable that arrangements cannot be made for you to meet
                            him but further instructions will be sent should such a meeting prove
                            possible. It seems important that there should be no undue delay in your
                            visit to Angora. You may, therefore, go at any time after July 24. This
                            will give the Department ample time to give you further instructions
                            before you start if Secretary Hughes should send any telegram from
                            London making this desirable.</p>

                        <p>166. On August 7 I had a conference with Ismet lasting 5 hours and 45
                            minutes. I took up cases of Adamopoulos, Fisher,<note n="31" xml:id="d640fn31">Edgar J. Fisher, professor at Robert College. The
                                Turkish Director of Public Education had demanded his dismissal,
                                under threat of closing the college, the reason given being alleged
                                remarks made by him during a lecture on board a tourist ship. On
                                representations by the High Commissioner and by the college
                                authorities, Professor Fisher was reinstated in October 1924.</note>
                            and McCarthy, and also the closing of Marash, Mersina and Tarsus
                            schools. At the end of conference I handed Ismet memoranda of the most
                            important cases pending and also the following <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire:</hi><note n="32" xml:id="d640fn32"><hi rend="italic">Aide-mémoire</hi> not paraphrased.</note>

                                <p>Admiral Bristol has sought a personal interview with His

                                    Government considers that the relations between the United
                                    States and Turkey have reached so unsatisfactory a state as to
                                    arouse serious anxiety as to the future.</p>
                                <p>A number of important matters affecting American interests,
                                    notably the Adamopoulos and McCarthy cases and the closing of
                                    the American schools at Marash and Tarsus, have been repeatedly
                                    brought to the attention of the Turkish Government. Throughout
                                    the representations which have been made the utmost patience and
                                    forbearance have been shown but on none of the matters in
                                    question have results been secured. The general situation as a
                                    whole, therefore, has steadily grown worse and Admiral Bristol
                                    has felt bound so to inform his Government. He is now in
                                    possession of instructions adapted to whatever developments the
                                    situation may take in <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0830"/>the more immediate future. Admiral Bristol, however, is
                                    confident that the personal intervention of His Excellency Ismet
                                    Pasha will insure a prompt adjustment of the settlement of
                                    matters at present at issue between the United States and Turkey
                                    and that there will therefore be no need for taking measures
                                    other than an appeal to His Excellency Ismet Pasha’s sense of
                                    justice and to the watchful regard for Turkey’s international
                                    interests of which he has given proof on so many occasions.
                                    Admiral Bristol has been granted a months leave of absence by
                                    his Government, of which he proposes to avail himself
                                    immediately. He feels certain that upon his return he will have
                                    abundant proof that the confidence which he has reposed in His
                                    Excellency Ismet Pasha has not been misplaced and that the
                                    results hoped for will have been achieved.</p>

                            apparent I hope that he has been led to see how serious is the present
                            situation and that favorable action may be secured within the next few
                            weeks by his personal intervention. I am leaving the office of delegate
                            at Angora vacant for a short time to emphasize the idea that the period
                            when I will be on leave from Constantinople is a period of probation
                            during which we expect results.</p>

                        <p>196. Having returned from leave I submit the following estimation of the
                            situation and recommendations as to policy:</p>
                        <p>1. I give the present status of the more important questions pending,
                            most of which I discussed on August 7 in my conference with Ismet, as
                            follows: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Adamopoulos and Fisher cases
                            have been settled and the McCarthy case has been arranged; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) there has been no change in the situation
                            regarding the schools at Marash, Mersine, and Tarsus; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) see my telegram 194 of October 2, 1 p.m., regarding
                            transfers of property.</p>
                        <p>2. The representations which I made to Ismet nearly two months ago have
                            been only partially successful, therefore, as far as tangible results
                            go. There are two possible policies which we can follow: <list>
                                <label>A.</label>
                                <item>Take issue with the Turks on any or all of the unsettled
                                    questions mentioned above, my recall being used as an extra
                                    sanction.</item>
                                <label>B.</label>
                                <item>Act on the theory that the Turkish Government with its
                                    nationalistic temper will not be affected by the taking of
                                    drastic measures, avoid giving offense, and continue policy of
                                    patience and plain speaking.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>3. There is little to be said at present for policy A except that judged
                            by the standards of normal diplomatic practice or by the irritation and
                            impatience which at times, with feelings as they are now, it is
                            difficult to avoid, such a course is always obvious and tempting.</p>
                        <p>With respect to policy B there are three points which should be stressed:
                                (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Other foreign governments having
                            interests in Turkey more extensive than our own are renewing diplomatic
                            relations and are taking care to avoid issues even in the face of
                            greater difficulties than we face. In view of this, for us to follow a
                            directly opposite policy would be anomalous at least, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) It is impossible to know at all accurately the character
                            and importance of the opposition until the Assembly reconvenes on
                            October 23. It would be a serious matter to embark upon anything like
                            policy A in the absence of this information. …</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0832"/>
                        <p>5. I strongly recommend for the present that we follow policy B. I would
                            like as soon as possible to receive the comments and instructions of the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>(2) Please instruct delegate at Angora to take up orally with appropriate
                            Turkish officials question of transfer of real property. The delegate
                            should state that our Government is loath to believe that, at a time
                            when neither Turkey nor the United States has ratified the treaty signed
                            at Lausanne, the Turkish Government will desire by an arbitrary decision
                            to raise openly an issue as to American rights in this matter which
                            existing agreements between Turkey and the United States clearly define.
                            The delegate may add that Turkish nationals are freely given the right
                            to acquire and own real property in the United States, despite the
                            breaking of diplomatic relations, to the extent that other friendly
                            aliens enjoy this right and that the American Government has observed
                            with concern that Turkey <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0833"/>has
                            continued restrictions against citizens of this country, which the state
                            of relations between the two countries at no time justified and which
                            Turkey has now withdrawn as applied to nationals of states with which
                            Turkey has recently been at war. Under these circumstances it would
                            obviously be a discrimination against citizens of the United States to
                            continue these restrictions.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to inform you, under
                            instructions from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs, that since peace between Turkey and Greece was concluded by the
                            signature of the Treaty of Lausanne, His Majesty’s Government have been
                            in receipt of applications for licences to export to Turkey arms and war
                            material generally, and for support in obtaining concessions from <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0834"/>the Turkish Government for the
                            erection in Turkey of plant for the manufacture of munitions.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, the whole of Turkey, except European Turkey, lies
                            within the prohibited zone as defined in Article 6 of the Arms Traffic
                            Convention of September 10th, 1919.<note n="38" xml:id="d646fn38"><ref target="frus1920v01#pg_180"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations</hi>, 1920, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p.
                                    180</ref>.</note> It was so included because it was generally
                            agreed that if Turkey could become an arms exporting state, such arms
                            would inevitably reach areas from which the Arms Traffic Convention was
                            specially designed to exclude them. Though the Convention has not been
                            ratified, it is, as you are aware, in force, so far as the prohibited
                            zone is concerned, by informal agreement between His Majesty’s
                            Government and the Governments of France, Italy, Belgium and Japan, all
                            of which are interested in areas where the importation of arms would be
                            bound to prove a source of uneasiness. I am therefore to inform you that
                            it is the present policy of His Majesty’s Government to refuse
                            applications for the export of arms to the region of the former Ottoman
                            Empire.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government are of opinion that the co-operation of the
                            French, Italian, Japanese and Belgian Governments in loyally observing
                            by an informal agreement the spirit of the Arms Traffic Convention in so
                            far as it affects Turkey, would lead to no useful result should the
                            Government of the United States feel themselves free to export arms to
                            Turkey or to encourage United States citizens to seek for concessions
                            for their manufacture in that country.</p>
                        <p>It will be remembered that in May, 1922, when the Government of British
                            Honduras wished to dispose of certain arms to one or other of the
                            Central American Governments, permission to do so was withheld out of
                            deference to the wishes of the United States Government, and in the note
                            which you were so good as to address to Sir Auckland Geddes on June
                            22nd, 1922,<note n="39" xml:id="d646fn39">Not printed.</note> you
                            informed His Excellency that it was the view of the Government of the
                            United States that the sale of arms to a country where political
                            conditions were known to be unstable, might create embarrassment to
                            foreign governments whose nationals have property interests in the
                            countries concerned and might indeed prove a factor in making the
                            political situation still more unstable. It is the policy, therefore, of
                            His Majesty’s Government to refuse licences for the export of military
                            arms to the Central American Republics.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed to point out that the situation at present existing in
                            Turkey and the adjacent countries is, in many respects, similar to that
                            in Central America, and the arms traffic in such areas is, in the
                            opinion of His Majesty’s Government, no less immoral and destructive of
                            life than the opium traffic elsewhere. His Majesty’s Government,
                            therefore, feel justified in hoping that the United States Government
                                <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0835"/>will do what may be in
                            their power to prevent arms reaching or being manufactured in Turkey
                            through the action of United States citizens, both on grounds of
                            reciprocity, and in pursuance of their declared policy, as set forth in
                            the statement issued to the press by the Department of State on

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            note of November 13, 1923, informing me that since the conclusion of
                            peace between Turkey and Greece by the signature of the Treaty of
                            Lausanne, the British Government has been in receipt of applications for
                            licenses to export to Turkey arms and war material generally, and for
                            support in obtaining concessions from the Turkish Government for the
                            erection in Turkey of a plant for the manufacture of munitions. You
                            point out that the whole of Turkey, except European Turkey, lies within
                            the prohibited zone as defined in Article 6 of the Arms Traffic
                            Convention of September 10, 1919, which, although not ratified, you
                            state to be in force, so far as this zone is concerned, by informal
                            agreement between the British, French, Italian, Japanese and Belgian
                            Governments. You indicate the opinion of the British Government that
                            this agreement, in so far as it affects Turkey, would lead to no useful
                            result should the Government of the United States feel itself free to

                            concessions for their manufacture in that country. You state that the
                            British Government feels justified in hoping that the Government of the
                            United States will do what may be in its power to prevent arms reaching
                            Turkey or being manufactured in Turkey through the action of United

                            1923. In conclusion <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0836"/>you request
                            an expression of the views of the Government of the United States for

                        <p>With regard to the informal agreement between the British, French,
                            Italian, Japanese and Belgian Governments, to which you refer, it is not
                            entirely clear to what extent such an agreement would be effective in
                            preventing arms from reaching Asiatic Turkey as long as European Turkey
                            is not included within its scope. Further, I should be glad to be
                            informed whether in the view of His Britannic Majesty’s Government this
                            informal agreement has been effective in preventing the shipment of arms
                            to Turkey on the part of the nationals of the governments which you
                            indicate have cooperated in its observance.</p>
                        <p>However, in view of the policy which was outlined in the statement of
                            September 27, 1923, to which you refer, this Government under existing
                            conditions will decline to sell government war supplies of the character
                            of instruments of destruction to countries in the troubled areas of the
                            Near East, and it will not extend support to its nationals in any effort
                            to promote the manufacture in Turkey or the shipment and sale to Turkey
                            of such supplies. Further, under present conditions this Government
                            would not favor the flotation of a foreign loan in this country of which
                            the proceeds would be utilized for armament.</p>
                        <p>I may add that I am not informed that United States nationals have been
                            engaged to any appreciable extent in the traffic in arms with
                            Turkey.</p>

                            receipt of your note of July 21, 1924, in which, acting in behalf of the
                            Government of His Britannic Majesty and in concert with your French and
                            Italian colleagues, you invited the Government of the United States to
                            appoint a delegate to represent it on the Commission to be established,
                            under Article 116 of the Treaty of Peace signed at Lausanne on July 24,
                            1923, between Turkey and the Allied Powers, for the settlement of
                            questions incident to the liquidation of the former sanitary
                            administration in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>I desire to express to you my appreciation of your courtesy in inviting
                            the Government of the United States to designate a member of the
                            Commission to which you refer. Having regard to the circumstances of the
                            former participation of the United States with other Powers in the
                            regulation of sanitary affairs in the Ottoman Empire, this Government
                            would naturally desire to observe the work of the Commission and to have
                            such voice in its decisions as American interests may seem to require.
                            It is noted, however, that under the Treaty Article mentioned above the
                            final authority on the questions presented to the Commission is to be
                            the Council of the League of Nations, a body on which the United States
                            is not represented. Such being the case, this Government could not
                            appropriately designate a member of the Commission with authority to
                            participate in its decisions. I shall be pleased, however, if such a
                            course is agreeable to the Governments concerned, to designate a
                            representative to sit with the Commission in a consultative capacity and
                            should occasion arise to enter appropriate reservations regarding any
                            American interests that may be disclosed.</p>

                        <p>Surgeon W. W. King of the United States Public Health Service, now at
                            Paris, has been designated to participate in a consultative capacity in
                            the meeting of the proposed Sanitary Commission which the Department
                            understands will take place shortly at Constantinople. The Department
                            desires that you should cooperate with Dr. King in his work with the
                            Commission. The Department has been in correspondence with the High
                            Commission on this subject and it is suggested that you confer with the
                            latter. In the event that any questions should arise which might require
                            this Government’s consideration, they should be referred to the
                            Department through the High Commission.</p>
