                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102-138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102-138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts that contributed to the formulation of policies and records that
                    provided supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>
                <p>The editors of this volume are convinced that it meets all regulatory, statutory,
                    and scholarly standards of selection and editing. Although <pb n="IV"
                        xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>this volume records policies and events of more
                    than 30 years ago, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute allows
                    the Department until 1996 to reach the 30-year line in the publication of the
                    series.</p>

                        Series</hi></p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series for the years 1961-1963. The subseries presents in 25
                    print volumes and 5 microfiche supplements a documentary record of major foreign
                    policy decisions and actions of the administration of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_KJF2">John F. Kennedy</persName>. The record of U.S. foreign
                    economic policy during 1961-1963 has been compiled in one print volume and one
                    microfiche supplement.</p>
                <p>This volume presents the documentary record of major foreign economic policies
                    with respect to financial and monetary policy, foreign assistance, international
                    development and investment, trade and commerce, economic defense, and strategic
                    materials and commodities. A separate microfiche supplement will comprise
                    additional documentation on general policy, financial and monetary policy,
                    foreign assistance, and trade and commerce, regarded by the editors as
                    significant but not warranting inclusion in the printed volume.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Sources for the Foreign Relations
                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major foreign policy
                    decisions and actions of the U.S. Government. It further requires that
                    government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. The editors believe that in terms of
                    access this volume was prepared in accordance with the standards and mandates of
                    the statute, although access to some records was restricted, as noted below.</p>
                <p>The editors have had complete access to all the retired records and papers in the
                    Department of State: the central files of the Department; the decentralized
                    files (“lot files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and division
                    levels; the files of the Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the
                    records of international conferences and high-level official visits,
                    correspondence with foreign leaders by the President and Secretary of State, and
                    memoranda of conversations between the President and Secretary of State and
                    foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic posts. Certain
                    intelligence-related files maintained in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    became available to the Department historians only after this volume was
                    compiled. Arrangements have been made for Department historians to have access
                    to these records for future volumes.</p>
                <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies including the
                    National Security Council, Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
                    Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Office of the Special Trade
                    Representative, the Department of the Treasury, and the Agency for International
                    Development. All of this documentation has been made available for use in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of
                    these agencies and the cooperation and support of the National Archives and
                    Records Administration.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
                    Defense (particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary
                    of Defense and his major assistants), the Department of Commerce, and the Agency
                    for International Development.</p>
                <p>Since 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency has provided expanded access to
                    Department historians to high-level intelligence documents from those records
                    still in the custody of that Agency. Department historians' access is arranged
                    by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence, Central
                    Intelligence Agency. This access arrangement began with the research of volumes
                    for the 1961-1963 triennium. Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the procedural and scholarly
                    aspects of this access, and the variety of documentation made available and
                    selected for publication in the volumes has expanded.</p>

                        Foreign Relations Series</hi></p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary. Some general decisions are also made regarding
                    issues that cannot be documented in the volume but will be addressed in a
                    microfiche supplement or in bibliographical notes.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The compiler-editors also tend to apply these selection criteria
                    in accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards
                    of scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors give
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI"
                        facs="0006"/>than previously published records (which are accounted for in

                            Volume IX</ref></hi></p>
                <p>In general, the editors of this volume, the research and editing of which was
                    completed in 1992, have defined a “major issue” as a foreign economic policy or
                    problem that received high-level attention within the U.S. Government, from the
                    President, key White House aides, or Cabinet-level officials; and/or had
                    long-range repercussions for U.S. foreign policy and interests. While it was
                    impossible to include the details of U.S. policy on every foreign economic
                    issue, documentation has been included, either in the print volume or the
                    microfiche supplement, that delineates basic U.S. policies toward the subjects
                    in question.</p>
                <p>The primary focus of the documents in this volume is on the foreign policymaking
                    process of the U.S. Government, including documentation illuminating policy
                    formulation and major aspects and repercussions of its execution. Emphasis is
                    placed on official memoranda that reveal policy positions, show differences
                    within the U.S. Government over policy formulation, summarize developments and
                    positions regarding an issue, and describe decisions or actions taken at the
                    National Security Council. Some key instructions sent to diplomatic posts are
                    included when they demonstrate the details of the execution of a policy.
                    Memoranda of conversations with foreign leaders both abroad and in Washington
                    were selected to provide additional information on the origins and impact of
                    foreign policy decisions.</p>
                <p>The editors selected only the most important reports from diplomatic posts,
                    particularly those containing the records of significant conversations held with
                    foreign leaders and their diplomatic repre- sentatives on economic issues.
                    Details of military and economic assistance programs for specific nations or
                    their implementation are not included.</p>
                <p>Documentation selected by the editor for inclusion in the microfiche supplement
                    provides additional details on the major issues covered in this volume. The
                    annotation to printed documents contains references to related documents
                    included in the microfiche supplement. The supplement also includes several
                    lengthy attachments to printed documents. In these cases, the printed document
                    contains editorial references to the appropriate microfiche document. The volume
                    may be used without the supplement, but the microfiche should be used in
                    conjunction with the printed volume.</p>

                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>For each of the seven foreign economic topics, the documents are presented
                    chronologically according to Washington time or, in the case of conferences, in
                    the order of individual meetings. Incoming telegrams from U.S. Missions are
                    placed according to time of receipt in the Department of State or other
                    receiving agency, rather than the time of transmission; memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this print volume and from the microfiche supplement because it was
                    unrelated to the subject of the <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The unnumbered first footnote to each document indicates the document's source,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. The source
                    footnote also provides the background of important documents and policies and
                    indicates if the President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every
                    effort has been made to determine if a document has been previously published,
                    and this information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                <p>The declassification review of this volume in 1993 and 1994 resulted in the
                    decision to withhold approximately .01 percent of the documents originally
                    selected; no documents were denied in full. The remaining documentation provides
                    an account of the major foreign economic policy issues confronting, and the
                    policies undertaken by, the U.S. Government during this period.</p>

                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                            the balance of payments situation should be confined to the President
                            and his Secretary of the Treas-ury only. This would mean that the
                            government would be speaking with one voice and this would be very
                            helpful to an understanding by foreign governments of the United States
                            position. Secretary Anderson further recommended that communications
                            with the Federal Reserve System be kept in the family and particularly
                            in cases where there were differences of opinions.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the morale effect of separating military
                            families brought about by the recent order made in an effort to
                            alleviate the balance of payments situation.<note n="1" xml:id="d1fn1"

                            that this was done as a quick move to do something concrete to stop the
                            flow of gold and to show our Allies that we meant business. He expressed
                            the hope that further study of this complicated matter would indicate
                            that other and less drastic means could be used for accomplishing this
                            purpose. He stated, however, that the situation could deteriorate to the
                            point where even more radical measures might become necessary but
                            expressed the hope that the Defense Department would minimize as much as
                            possible the <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0028"/>effects on dependents
                            of military men. For example, he discussed the possibility of returning
                            a full division to the United States, pointing out that this would
                            require careful preparation before it was done. He also stated that
                            American troops had been sent to Europe originally as an emergency move
                            to give Europe a chance to recover from the devastation of war and that
                            from the point of view of the United States we would be much stronger
                            militarily if we brought some of these troops home and had them located
                            as a central reserve.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that, in his opinion, the State Department should
                            bring back some dependents but thus far State has been recalcitrant. He
                            pointed out that the soldier does not want to be made the goat in this
                            matter and he felt this reaction was justified. The President also
                            stated that there are several agencies of the government which could
                            pick up some of the burden.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Anderson pointed out that gold erosion is still going on at a
                            rate which we cannot afford—reporting $225 million from January 1, 1961,
                            to January 19, 1961.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> asked if there is
                            any change in the gold balance among our Allies, and Secretary Anderson
                            pointed out that all of our Allies have dollar surpluses—except Japan
                            which has recently changed its reserve ratio. Secretary Anderson
                            emphasized that the key to the gold problem is confidence on the part of
                            other nations in the stability of the dollar and our willingness and
                            ability to handle our fiscal affairs wisely. At this point, the
                            President pointed out that he had had a study made as to the effect of
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>'s programs on the outflow of
                            gold and found this to be minimal.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">The <gloss

                        <p>Secretary Anderson indicated that the British had been very helpful in
                            the gold situation and had worked with us very closely. He also pointed
                            out that the Treasury Department keeps a “watch officer” on duty 24
                            hours a day on this particular matter.</p>

                        <p>On February 6, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> sent a special message to Congress outlining
                            measures to ease the crisis in the U.S. balance-of-payments situation.
                            Because of a continuing deficit in the balance of payments, the United
                            States had suffered a gold outflow, which was <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3"
                                facs="0029"/>troublesome, <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> emphasized, “not only for us but also for our
                            friends and allies who rely on the dollar to finance a substantial
                            portion of their trade.” He went on to propose both short- and long-term
                            measures to eliminate the deficit and stem the outflow of gold caused by
                            loss of foreign confidence in the dollar. He assigned specific
                            responsibilities to the Departments of the Treasury, State, Defense,
                            Commerce, and Agriculture, the Bureau of the Budget, and the
                            Export-Import Bank to implement his program for export promotion,
                            burdensharing in defense and foreign assistance, and financial
                            restraints and incentives designed to encourage foreign dollar
                            investments. For text of his message, see <hi rend="italic">Public

                            to report to you periodically on the progress achieved. Accordingly, I
                            am submitting this report on the status of measures taken by the several
                            Departments and Agencies to strengthen our balance of payments

                        <p>In preparing this report I thought it would be most convenient for you if
                            I referred to each of the measures which you described in your Balance

                                xml:id="d3fn2">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> in the

                            have not yet been reached.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of this review I conclude that no additional action on your

                                        to domestic commercial banks through its adoption, an
                                        Administration bill was sent to the Banking and Currency
                                        Committees of both branches of Congress on March 14, 1961,
                                        which would amend the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal
                                        Deposit Insurance Corporation Act to exempt from regulation
                                        the rates of interest paid by banks on time deposits held in
                                        this country by foreign governments or monetary authorities,
                                        and certain international institutions. No schedule for
                                        hearings on this Bill has yet been set.</p>
                                    <p>After action has been taken on the proposed bill, the
                                        desirability of special Treasury issues to foreign
                                        governments and monetary authorities will be considered in
                                        the light of circumstances then obtaining.</p>

                                    used in this connection. The Secretary of Commerce and his staff
                                    have constantly urged export expansion in their public

                            our forces, particularly through the combined use of facilities with our
                            allies. Discussions conducted by Ambassador Dowling have begun with the
                            Germans in Bonn. Also under review are increased purchases of newer
                            weapons and weapons systems by those countries financially capable of
                            paying for them. It is estimated that sales to the financially capable

                        <p>Since the effectiveness of the directives will in large measure depend
                            upon the way in which they are carried out at subsidiary levels,
                            periodic follow-ups and reviews will be necessary.</p>
                        <p>I find it a matter of disappointment that the Defense Department has been
                            unable to achieve more savings from its direct operations—which <pb
                                n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0036"/>so far are estimated at only $170
                            million for calendar year 1961. With annual outlays of close to $3
                            billion I would hope that at least $500 million in savings could be
                            found. In particular, I believe that much more than the $65 million
                            estimate could be cut from the almost $1 billion of procurement
                            overseas. Unless we do better I fear that public pressure for the
                            reduction of our forces overseas will again emerge. I intend to meet
                            with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>,

                            assuring proper interagency consultation and coordination in this
                            field.</p>

                            chairmanship, with the Under Secretaries in the interested departments.
                            I am enclosing a letter which he has dispatched to the various

                        <p>This interdepartmental committee met regularly until late June 1962 when

                            committee remained inactive, however, for 6 months. A background paper
                            on the committee and its future was transmitted under cover of a

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments and Related Problems</hi>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> introduced the main
                            topic by noting that it cuts across the activities of all the agencies
                            represented, and that our ability to solve this problem will largely
                            determine the extent to which we may be committed to lines which are
                            contrary to those that we wish to pursue at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> then developed the
                            points made in the Treasury paper, “The Balance of Payments and our
                            Foreign Economic Policy.”<note n="1" xml:id="d6fn1">Dated September 29.
                                (Ibid.)</note> The basis for balance-of-payments actions is the
                            President's message of February <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0039"
                            />6, which outlined in broad form U.S. policies for dealing with the
                            problem. Quarterly reports from the various participating agencies have
                            been compiled into one over-all report to the President. An attempt will
                            be made to put the next report, due the latter part of October or first
                            of November, in a form that would be available for widespread official
                            distribution so that all agencies can see what is going on.</p>
                        <p>Treasury expects to initiate a series of small task force meetings on
                            particular phases of the problem and the Secretary will sit down with
                            the two or three Departments or Agencies concerned to discuss what more
                            should be done. This is a device to keep the program moving and
                            up-to-date.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> then discussed the
                            problem of short-term capital movements under conditions of currency
                            convertibility and the measures being taken and considered to deal with
                            this problem. He said that the Vienna negotiations represented
                            substantial progress although they might be less ambitious than some
                            people might hope for. He pointed out that we are limited by what other
                            countries are prepared to accept.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion that followed the Treasury presentation, Mr. Tobin
                            warned that, even though our position may be improving, we must bear in
                            mind that in the next one to three years the balance almost inevitably
                            will worsen because our domestic recovery will cause imports to increase
                            faster than exports. It may be a few years before the measures we are
                            taking now improve our basic position. The important question is whether
                            we are able to protect the dollar from runs during the transition period
                            when things get worse before they get better.</p>
                        <p>On the multilateral aspects of the currency question, he continued, there
                            is a question of how much we should rely on bilateral transactions and
                            how much we should use international organizations like the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tobin also warned that while implementing the short-term measures, we
                            must keep in mind the long run. We must remember that in the long run if
                            we get back in balance and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> does
                            also, and if we haven't a new reserve currency, we have the question of
                            the mechanism for supplying liquidity thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen asked if it isn't possible that we could deal with the
                            short-term problem in ways which we will not like in the long term. In
                            foreign aid, for example, we have gone into the consortium approach and
                            we are thereby setting up trading patterns which are not in our
                            long-term interest. He cited the case of Pakistan and the tying of
                            purchases to countries furnishing aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said that, with the
                            exception of the Buy American meas-ures, he felt all of the short-run
                            actions in the financial field undertaken to contend with the
                            balance-of-payments problem are not only consistent with but promote the
                            kind of liberal foreign economic policy we are committed <pb n="14"
                                xml:id="pg_14" facs="0040"/>to. Mr. Coppock observed that the
                            February 6 Message puts a great burden on export expansion and domestic
                            monetary restraint, since devaluation, exchange controls, and new
                            restrictions on imports were ruled out as measures for correcting the
                            payments imbalance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GE5">Gudeman</persName> noted what Commerce is
                            doing in the way of export and travel promotion, and called attention to
                            the importance of trade centers abroad such as we have in London. One
                            thing Commerce wants to work on with the State Department is obtaining
                            better Commercial Attaches who will seek out opportunities for American
                            goods rather than just taking care of the material that comes over their
                            desks. In this regard, there will be a meeting of European Commercial
                            Attaches in London soon and we will give them suggestions. Also, we must
                            keep prices down so our goods will be competitive. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE5">Gudeman</persName> hopes for modernization of
                            equipment so that manufacturing can be more efficient and prices
                            reduced. We also need to give more attention to research and
                            development, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GE5">Gudeman</persName>
                            suggested Treasury might consider tax incentives so more would be spent
                            on research and development. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1"
                                >Fowler</persName> suggested that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GE5"
                                >Gudeman</persName> talk with Assistant Secretary Surrey about this.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GE5">Gudeman</persName> also mentioned the
                            need for export guarantees and lending terms comparable to those offered
                            by Europe so that we can support our exporters. He mentioned
                            particularly lending to finance exports to an American subsidiary abroad
                            for re-export.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen said the Budget Bureau had started a review of military policy
                            statements. A major question this poses for our balance of payments is
                            the movement and placement of troops. He suggested that Treasury might
                            keep in close touch with this.</p>

                            asked what could be done to further tighten up on the balance of
                            payments impact of foreign aid expenditures. I told him of our agreement
                            last week that Assist-ant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LJM2"

                            last week that the over-all balance of payments impact of foreign aid
                            operations, including our contributions to the Inter-American Bank and

                            should not exceed a billion dollars annually as compared to last year's
                            level of about $1.2 billion. The President expressed his concern that
                            the figure was running this high and asked that I inform you of his
                            concern and that we jointly furnish him with a progress report by the

                        <p>I am today submitting to you my Fourth Quarterly Report reviewing the
                            current balance-of-payments situation, and the status of the measures
                            taken to implement your Message to the Congress of February 6, 1961. The
                            Report is being widely distributed to other departments and agencies,
                            the activities and expenditures of which affect our <pb n="16"
                                xml:id="pg_16" facs="0042"/>balance of payments. This I am doing so
                            that all may be aware of the current situation and prospects, the need
                            for continued vigilance in holding down overseas expenditures, and the
                            need for even greater efforts to increase our receipts from other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The highlights of the Report are the following: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Despite a worsening in our “basic accounts” in the second half
                                    of 1961, our situation was much improved over 1960, and even
                                    more by comparison with 1959. This reflected the improvement in
                                    our merchandise trade. As our imports rose with domestic
                                    recovery in the last six months, however, the
                                    commercially-financed export surplus dropped. A large part of
                                    the improvement in our “basic balance” was due to the special,
                                    negotiated prepayments of debts owed the United States
                                    Government.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>For 1962, we have assumed that acceleration of European
                                    economic activity plus the cumulative effects of our various
                                    export promotion measures will raise commercially-financed
                                    exports by about $1 billion. On the other hand, increased
                                    economic activity at home will probably result in an increase in
                                    our imports of about $1.5 billion. Some prepayments of debt owed
                                    the United States can be expected, but they will probably fall
                                    considerably short of the $700 million received in 1961.
                                    However, the offset to our military expenditures in Germany
                                    recently worked out with the Federal Republic Government and
                                    others which are likely within the coming year should
                                    substantially lower our net military expenditures overseas.
                                    Taking all these factors into account, our “basic deficit” is
                                    likely to be somewhat larger than last year's basic deficit of
                                    $600 million.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Short-term capital movements continue to be unpredictable,
                                    even though last year more of them were “normal” commercial
                                    flows and not speculative capital. To the extent that our
                                    exports increase, we can expect a portion of the increase to be
                                    financed by short-term capital outflows. Such increases can
                                    contribute substantially to the over-all deficit as was the case
                                    last year. We are hopeful that other temporary outflows, based
                                    largely on interest rate differentials, will be reduced in 1962.
                                    Such a reduction could easily offset the moderate increase we
                                    look for in short-term capital outflows associated with
                                    expanding exports, and could lead to an over-all deficit
                                    somewhat smaller than that incurred in 1961.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item><p>In 1961 more foreign private recipients of dollars elected
                                        to hold them. This contributed to the sharp drop in our gold
                                        losses, as compared with 1960. Probably the most important
                                        single reason for this—and possibly the most important
                                        single development in this field in the past year—is the
                                        intangible but vital degree of international cooperation
                                        among monetary authorities which has been developed. A
                                        variety of ad hoc measures by different monetary authorities
                                        contributed to moderating <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17"

                                        arrangements which will in effect triple the resources of

                                    France, Italy and perhaps other industrial European nations with
                                    strong economies. During the current year we hope that by these
                                    means, plus sales of military goods and serv-ices to other Free
                                    World nations, we will be able to offset our defense

                                <item>For the longer run, export promotion must be given a major
                                    role. The variety of measures designed to increase businessmen's
                                    awareness of export opportunities, and awareness in foreign
                                    markets of what the United States has to offer, has been
                                    expanded. The Export-Import Bank-Foreign Credit Insurance
                                    Association scheme for export credit insurance is one of the new
                                    facilities offered business by Government. It will be
                                    appropriate to continue and steadily to improve these measures.
                                    Plans for an intensification of our national effort to expand
                                    our merchandise trade surplus are being surveyed for

                                    remain are overseas defense expenditures and the degree of
                                    financing of local costs which may be considered necessary in

                                <item>We will make every effort to minimize the balance-of-payments

                                    offsetting arrangements with our industrial allies. With respect
                                    to the remaining impact, while further savings will undoubtedly

                                    balance of payments at the present time is the question of
                                    financing the local costs of projects and programs. Largely
                                    because of this type of expenditure, <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                        >AID</gloss> officials had estimated that commitments of

                                        target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds would result in
                                    expenditures abroad of $837 million, as opposed to $647 million
                                    resulting from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962
                                    commitments. These estimates are now being revised upwards.
                                    Over-all foreign assistance expenditures resulting in an
                                    immediate cash outflow from the United States (reflecting also

                                    were about $1.3 billion in calendar years 1960 and 1961. This
                                    total cannot be allowed to increase and must be reduced to about
                                    $1 billion if our foreign assistance operations are to bear
                                    their fair share of the burden involved in reaching a balance in

                        <p>This is of particular importance in the Alliance for Progress, and may be
                            an increasing problem in other areas, particularly in Africa. We have
                            sought a number of ways to minimize the balance-of-payments effects of
                            the local cost financing which <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            undertakes. Among these have been the placing of the dollar funds in
                            segregated accounts, to be used only to pay for United States goods and
                            services, and the agreement reached with Nigeria that it would find
                            other means of increasing imports from the United States by an amount at
                            least as great as the United States financing of local costs. While the
                            Nigerian example is interesting, it may not prove possible to implement
                            it in the desired fashion. Segregated accounts may simply result in
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> financing of United States
                            exports which would have been made in any event. Senior policy officials
                            of State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> are currently
                            cooperating with us in exploring other potential methods of minimizing
                            the balance-of-payments impact of local cost financing. I will furnish
                            you with a special report on the results of these studies in the next
                            two weeks.</p>
                        <p>In summary, our position is considerably improved. But we cannot relax
                            our efforts. Further vigilance and ingenuity in holding down
                            expenditures, and further efforts to increase our receipts, are
                            necessary.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Department of Commerce statistics show that in 1961 total foreign
                            economic aid expenditures (including PL 480 and Ex-Im Bank) were $4.1
                            billion, of which $1.3 billion was paid directly to foreign countries or
                            international organizations and therefore involved an immediate dollar
                            outflow from the United States. Treasury is of the opinion that steps
                            should be taken to limit this outflow in future years to $1 billion as
                            part of our over-all program to overcome the current U.S. balance of
                            payments deficit. While <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> seriously

                            effectiveness of the foreign aid program, it is prepared to make a
                            serious effort to meet the Treasury goal. As a first step, the Agency is
                            presently attempting in cooperation with Treasury and State to develop
                            possible techniques for achieving this goal. Should this prove
                            impossible without undue risk, in the judgment of <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, a further report will be submitted to
                            you.</p>
                        <p>The $1 billion limit poses a difficult problem in view of the increase in
                            the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program to almost $3.4 billion
                            out of about $6.2 billion in total foreign economic aid anticipated for
                            programming in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963. Dollar outflow
                            payments from the $6.2 billion are expected under current policies to be
                            about $1.25 billion, of which the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            program will account for roughly $1 billion.</p>
                        <p>Inevitably there will be some delay before any policy change which might
                            be made affecting the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 program
                            will be reflected in a reduction in actual dollar outflow on an
                            expenditure basis. During 1962 and 1963 expenditures will to a large
                            extent be made from funds programmed in earlier fiscal years, but since
                            these funds have already been committed, we have little or no power now
                            to influence the manner in which they are spent.</p>

                        <p>The reduction in third country procurement reflects decisions made in
                            1959 to emphasize U.S. procurement with Development Loan funds and in

                            programs for the financing of local development costs, particularly in
                            Latin America and Africa.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that if the $1 billion limit on dollar outflow is to be
                            achieved, it will have to be by changing the form in which <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> supports local costs or possibly by
                            cutting back on our assistance to these areas. Further cuts in third
                            country procurement would impinge primarily on the less developed
                            countries and could adversely affect our development objectives. Other
                            payments, which consist principally of contributions to international
                            organizations and program operating costs, provide little margin for
                            reduction without either lessening our participation in international
                            organizations or substantially reducing over-all programs.</p>

                        <p>The local cost financing problem arises from the need to get important
                            projects under way rapidly in Latin America and Africa where there have
                            been no substantial assistance programs that generated local currency in
                            the past. These areas have a high priority need for infrastructure
                            facilities with a large local cost component. In the absence of local
                            currency counterpart, such as can be used for these purposes in the
                            Middle and Far East, it is often necessary to pay out dollars to obtain
                            the local currency needed for getting the projects started without undue
                            delay.</p>
                        <p>We must be careful not to take action which would unduly restrict our
                            freedom of operation in these areas or uneconomically force a
                            substitution of less efficient projects and techniques making relatively
                            intensive use of imported capital equipment for more efficient projects
                            and techniques making relatively intensive use of local resources. The
                            need is for a mechanism enabling us to stimulate the most appropriate
                            approaches to development while at the same time minimizing the advance
                            pay out of untied dollars.</p>

                        <p>On June 7, 1962, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            proposed in a memorandum to Secretary of the Treasury <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> the creation of an inter-Cabinet
                            Committee composed of <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            (chairman), the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Administrator to work on the
                            balance-of-payments problem. This committee “should come forward with a
                            program perhaps in November with assurances of bringing this problem
                            under control within a reasonable period of time.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> welcomed this suggestion in his
                            memorandum to the President, June 14, and recommended the addition of
                            the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to the group. He thought the
                            committee should operate informally so that it would not interfere with
                            the wider interagency coordination specified in the President's February
                            17 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> (see <ref

                            Economic Advisers and added that the President had said that <persName

                            committee after <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> mentioned
                            that the Department of State should be represented.</p>
                        <p>In a June 22 memorandum to the President, <persName corresp="#p_BMG2"
                                >McGeorge Bundy</persName> recommended the addition of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and a representative from the
                            Council of Economic Advisers and suggested that the President ask
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">David Bell</persName> to be prepared to
                            bring to the new committee proposals for a “gold budget” for use in

                            the ways of carrying forward a small inter-Cabinet committee on the
                            balance of payments. I agree with you that the Director of the Bureau of
                            the Budget should be added, and I also believe that we should have
                            representation from the State Department—presumably <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>—and from the Council of
                            Economic Advisers. I doubt if we would need any further White House
                            representation at this stage.</p>
                        <p>I agree with your view that the group should begin to think hard about
                            broad policy on the balance of payments, but I also want it to be a
                            working committee that will keep a sharp eye on the management of our
                            own disbursements within the Executive Branch. For this purpose I am
                            asking Dave Bell to be prepared to bring to the new committee proposals
                            for what might be called a “gold budget” for use in controlling all
                            federal expenditures that affect the balance of payments. A number of
                            instances in recent weeks have made it clear that our Executive control
                            in this area is not what it ought to be, and I think the basic budgetary
                            process provides an excellent analogy to the sort of thing we now need
                            in the balance of payments field.</p>
                        <p>Would you chair the committee and arrange for its frequent meeting.<note

                            that affect the U.S. balance of payments. It is estimated that of a

                            fiscal year 1962, less than $3 million will be used for procurement from
                            non-U.S. sources. A statement covering each of these actions has been
                            transmitted to the White House.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2">A six-page

                            <item>In certain countries, the actions proposed by the Defense
                                Department may result in a need for compensating increases in aid.
                                This appears especially likely to be the case in Korea, South
                                Vietnam, and the Republic of China, countries whose foreign exchange
                                requirements we, in essence, underwrite. In certain other countries,
                                including Iceland, the Philippines, and Japan, which are not now
                                major recipients of aid, the impact of reductions in U.S. military
                                expenditures may also create demands for aid. The economic situation
                                of these countries and our policy interests in them are such that we
                                cannot simply ignore the possibility that savings on military
                                account will be cancelled or substantially offset by increased
                                expenditures on aid account.</item>

                            House and <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> representatives. At that
                            time Mr. Hitch<note n="4" xml:id="d15fn4">Presumably <persName>Charles
                                    J. Hitch</persName>, Assistant Secretary of Defense
                                (Comptroller).</note> elaborated on the scope of the various
                            projects contained in the list. He pointed out that these were still in
                            the study stage and that final procurement actions would not be taken
                            until the completion of these studies. However, in some cases partial
                            steps are being taken in some of these areas that should result in an
                            early decrease of overseas expenditures by Defense.</p>
                        <p>During our discussions, the impact of reduced Defense expenditures in
                            certain countries in terms of possible increased aid requirements was
                            explored. In addition to the countries mentioned in the President's
                            memorandum, there also may be problems with respect to Greece, Turkey
                            and Pakistan. However, the precise impact on <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> cannot be determined until we know more specifically
                            the nature and extent of Defense's proposals to reduce expenditures in
                            those countries.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> considerations,
                            the implementation of certain of the projects proposed by Defense will
                            have significant political repercussions. Most obvious are those
                            projects relating to force reductions in overseas areas. In some cases
                            the withdrawals are rather small and should not present any unmanageable
                            political problems. On the other hand, the projects to reduce our Army
                            forces in Europe by 44,000 and the withdrawal of the one squadron in
                            Iceland present extremely serious political problems in terms of our
                            security objectives. Additional political repercussions will arise from
                            the economic impact in overseas areas of a number of Defense projects
                            should they be implemented, e.g. returning a major portion of petroleum
                            procurement to the U.S., reducing hiring <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28"
                                facs="0054"/>of foreign nationals. The seriousness of this impact,
                            however, cannot be judged until we have more precise information on the
                            magnitude and nature of these reductions. Furthermore, a number of the
                            suggested actions would put such activities as PX and commissaries in
                            direct competition with the local economy to a greater degree than is
                            presently the case, and we can probably expect local reaction to a move
                            of this type. The degree to which we can take such actions would have to
                            be carefully reviewed in light of agreements and understandings we have
                            with the host countries with respect to the basing of our forces in
                            their territory.</p>
                        <p>The Defense Study program does not provide explicitly for estimates of
                            the amounts of compensating aid that might be necessary as a result of
                            the impact on individual countries of the suggested actions. The net
                            benefit to our balance of payments depends on this, and on the amount by
                            which curtailment of dollar expenditures in each of the various
                            countries can be expected to result in reduced purchases from the U.S.
                            by all countries. Studies to establish a basis for reasoned judgments on
                            both scores must precede decisions on the various proposed policies. It
                            must also be recognized that procurement policies tailored to these
                            considerations would probably be discriminatory, in an absolute sense,
                            as between countries. This, also, could be productive of diplomatic
                            frictions.</p>
                        <p>I believe it is important to alert Defense to the fact that, unless
                            reductions are carefully and selectively applied, it may well result in
                            the development of a political atmosphere in a number of countries which
                            will make it extremely difficult for us to negotiate for the various
                            Defense arrangements and facilities that Defense itself considers
                            extremely important to have in order to maintain an effective combat
                            posture.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I believe that the studies outlined by Defense are
                            justified and should be undertaken. However, I think it extremely
                            important that the Department of State be fully consulted on these
                            studies and that, in those instances, where we believe there will be
                            serious adverse political effects the issue should be placed before the
                            Cabinet Committee prior to any implementation by the Department of
                            Defense.</p>

                        <p>98. With regard to recent announcements by SecDef concerning efforts to
                            reduce U.S. defense expenditures abroad, the following is provided for
                            your guidance in response any official or public queries.</p>
                        <p>Defense, under Presidential instructions and as part Government-wide
                            program to lower balance of payments deficit by reducing foreign
                            exchange expenditures, has initiated a number of study projects towards
                            this goal and which would at the same time not repeat not impair U.S.
                            combat effectiveness abroad. These studies, scope of which has been made
                            public, will cover U.S. military operations worldwide. They will involve
                            overseas procurement of supplies and services for U.S. Forces,
                            construction programs, expenditures by U.S. military personnel and their
                            dependents abroad, use of foreign labor whether by direct or contract
                            hire, review of overseas procurement for <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>, etc.</p>
                        <p>To date, SecDef has issued instructions on overseas procurement of
                            supplies and services for use by U.S. military forces abroad. These
                            require purchase from U.S. sources if contract does not exceed $10,000
                            or if delivered cost is estimated to be not more than 50% greater than
                            the cost from foreign sources. If contract is over $10,000 and cost
                            differential exceeds 50%, procurement action must be referred to SecDef
                            to determine whether it should be awarded to U.S. sources. Directive
                            exempts all procurement from indigenous sources which is undertaken
                            pursuant to a treaty or executive agreement and excludes purchases for
                            overseas construction, petroleum, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>,
                            and non-appropriated funds which are covered by separate directive.
                            Programs under excluded categories are now under study.</p>
                        <p>Also SecDef has directed that all proposed purchases abroad for Defense
                            purposes for use in U.S. under existing “Buy American Act” regulations
                            will be referred to SecDef to determine whether exception to normal
                            procedures would be in national interest.</p>
                        <p>It is important to emphasize that other specific Defense actions within
                            this over-all policy are in the study stage preliminary to decisions
                            which will be made in the future.</p>
                        <p>FYI. Department is coordinating closely with Defense on study projects
                            and implementing procurement directives. Both agencies recognize <pb
                                n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0056"/>political and economic
                            ramifications involved. Where military commands, <gloss

                            country and are undertaking reviews on overseas procurement pursuant to
                            Defense directives, all posts should work closely with those
                            organizations in this activity. Political and economic implications
                            which may result from implementing projects should be brought to the
                            attention of military commanders. Posts should similarly advise
                            Department of specific problems they foresee as a result of assessments
                            by posts and overseas Defense organizations. End FYI.</p>

                        <p>The Committee has reviewed recent developments in the payments situation
                            of the United States; the measures proposed by the Department of Defense

                            establishing a control system for international transactions of Federal
                            agencies. It submits the following report and recommendations for your
                            approval.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>For the first half of 1962 the over-all deficit in our balance of
                            payments has run at an annual rate of about $1-1/2 billion. This
                            represents a very substantial improvement over the deficits of $2.46
                            billion in 1961 and $3.9 billion in 1960. The improvement in 1962 has
                            been due largely to smaller out-flows of short-term capital and certain
                            nonrecurring factors, such as one-time military payments by Germany.
                            Nevertheless, our exports have continued to grow and the increase in our
                            imports has been smaller than expected. The worsening of our basic
                            deficit—the balance <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0057"/>on all
                            transactions except short-term capital and unrecorded transactions—has
                            so far in 1962 not been as bad as had been anticipated. Subtracting
                            one-time receipts in both 1961 (the German debt prepayment) and 1962
                            (debt prepayments and German military procurement funds), the basic
                            deficit in the first half of 1962 seems likely to amount to an annual
                            rate of about $1.4 billion, as compared with $1.1 billion for all of
                            1961. This deterioration in the basic deficit was relatively slight
                            taking into account the fact that in response to rising domestic
                            economic activity our imports during the first half of 1962 were running
                            at a level some $1.4 billion higher, annual rate, than imports for 1961
                            as a whole. For the rest of 1962 we may expect that only a small further
                            increase in imports is likely to take place.</p>
                        <p>Despite improvement in our over-all deficit, we are continuing to lose
                            gold at a substantial rate. Gold losses during the first half of 1962
                            amounted to $420 million compared with $857 million for all of 1961. In
                            other words, whereas in 1961 only about one-third of our over-all
                            deficit was reflected in a gold loss, so far in 1962 almost 60 percent
                            of our deficit has been reflected in a gold loss. These continued gold
                            losses raise the question of confidence in the dollar—of continued
                            willingness of foreign monetary authorities to increase their dollar
                            holdings. They strongly underline the importance of action to eliminate
                            the deficit in our balance of payments at the earliest possible
                            moment.</p>

                            overseas expenditures” and stated your view that “any final decision to
                            reduce one of the categories of expenditures should be made only after
                            full consideration of its probable impact on the other, as well as its
                            budgetary costs.”</p>
                        <p>In order to carry out these provisions the Secretary of Defense has
                            agreed to keep the appropriate agencies informed of the development of
                            the projects outlined in Annex A and, in particular, to identify at an
                            early stage, in consultation with such agencies, any project which
                            appears likely (1) to necessitate a substantial increase in United
                            States budget costs; (2) to have an impact of such magnitude on the
                            economy of a foreign nation or nations as to call for consideration of
                            increased United <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0058"/>States aid as
                            compensation; (3) to result in large-scale reductions in United States
                            expenditures in countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany where
                            a full offset agreement exists; or (4) to result in a reduction of such
                            magnitude in the foreign exchange resources of a foreign nation or
                            nations as to create the likelihood of such nations adopting new
                            restrictions affecting commercial imports (including those from the
                            United States) or to affect the ability of this Government to negotiate
                            steps toward reducing existing restraints (in both the tariff and
                            nontariff fields) affecting commercial imports; or (5) to involve other
                            significant foreign policy considerations. The Committee will be
                            informed of any disagreements between agencies and, as directed in your
                            memorandum of July 16, those disagreements which the Committee cannot
                            resolve will be referred to you.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the foregoing paragraph, the Committee has arranged

                            (including State with respect to the Military Assistance Program) to

                        <p>The Committee agrees that a reduction in the net defense expenditures to
                            the level of $1.6 billion per year appears attainable in <gloss

                            arrangements and increased sales of United States military goods and
                            services. The Departments of State, Treasury and Defense are continuing
                            to pursue military offset negotiations and military equipment sales
                            promotion as a matter of high priority. Further reductions in later
                            years should be possible as the projects in Annex A are developed and

                            Both these objectives are important to our foreign economic policy.

                        </list>
                        <p>The two principal lines of attack on the balance of payments deficit
                            consist of measures to curtail the outflow of dollars stemming from the
                            activities of government itself, and measures to increase our export
                            receipts. The measures adopted over the past two years have contributed
                            to the improvement to date in those areas. The importance of actions to
                            reduce government expenditures abroad relates not only to their direct
                            contribution to the improvement in the balance of payments, but also to
                            their effect in demonstrating to the American public that the Federal
                            Government is carrying its full weight in meeting the problem.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Reducing Government Expenditures Abroad</p>
                        <p>At your direction I am chairing a Cabinet Committee on the Balance of
                            Payments. The regular meetings of this Committee are providing the focal
                            point for discussion and resolution of major policy issues in this
                            field. In addition to its own reports to you, the Committee has reviewed
                            this report and the first quarterly report to you from the Director of
                            the Bureau of the Budget which is discussed below.</p>
                        <p>The most important recent action in this area is the new Defense program
                            for reducing expenditures entering the balance of payments. More
                            significant savings may result from this program than from previous
                            efforts by that Department to reduce expenditures, because of the basic
                            change in the level of additional budgetary costs considered
                            “acceptable” in order to effect balance of payments savings.</p>
                        <p>The second most significant government expenditure affecting the balance
                            of payments is foreign economic assistance. Procedures for seeking to
                            insure minimum adverse effects on the balance of payments of <pb n="36"
                                xml:id="pg_36" facs="0062"/>cash transfers to aid recipients,
                            primarily for the financing of local currency costs of projects, have
                            now been agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>The magnitude and importance for the balance of payments of other
                            government expenditures abroad will be assessed and controlled through
                            the new control system for foreign exchange expenditures of Federal
                            agencies which the Bureau of the Budget has instituted with your
                            approval. Though the potential savings in the expenditures of other
                            Government departments and agencies will be relatively minor by
                            comparison with Defense and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            expenditures, they will nevertheless be important collectively.</p>

                            pursuant to your interim approval, with the development under Defense
                            Project Eight of a series of actions aimed at helping to reduce the net
                            adverse effect of defense expenditures on the balance of payments to the
                            level of $1.6 billion in fiscal year 1963, and to not more than $1
                            billion in fiscal year 1966. This compares with a level of $2.6 billion
                            in fiscal year 1961.</p>
                        <p>The agreement reached with Germany last October to offset U.S. military
                            expenditures in that country during 1961 and 1962 is expected to yield
                            about $1 billion during the current calendar year (including
                            reclassification of the German account). This agreement was extended to
                            cover calendar years 1963 and 1964 in a “Memorandum of Understanding”
                            dated 14 September 1962.</p>
                        <p>Negotiations have also been undertaken with France for an offset
                            arrangement for U.S. expenditures there, but French officials have
                            stated that major increases in purchases from the U.S. will not occur,
                            as long as the U.S. remains unwilling to sell equipment in the nuclear
                            and missile fields. Negotiations for an offset arrangement with Italy
                            resulted in an Understanding, reached on 19 September 1962, that Italy
                            will place initial orders for military equipment, approximating $100
                            million, with the U.S. Department of Defense within 30 days and that the
                            U.S. will guarantee the availability of $100 million in credit
                            assistance repayable over five years.</p>
                        <p>On July 16, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            announced a tightening of restrictions on overseas procurement.<note

                            from last January through June 30, 1962 led to decisions to reduce or
                            close 46 overseas bases and facilities.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> has agreed with our
                            target of reducing to $1 billion annually the portion of economic aid
                            expenditures which is paid to foreigners. He has also issued
                            instructions to explore the possibilities of a further reduction, in
                            line with your desire.</p>
                        <p>Of the total $1,250 million of such outpayments which was expected in
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963, about $500 million comprised
                            contributions to international organizations and overseas operating
                            costs of the aid program. The former item, at least, is not subject to
                            much compression, but we are examining possible means of delaying the
                            balance of payments impact.</p>
                        <p>Third country commodity procurement by <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> has already been sharply reduced, from 56 percent of
                            total commodity procurement in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961 to
                            36 percent of a much smaller total in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1962. The drop in procurement in the nineteen industrialized countries,
                            from which procurement is now generally prohibited, was even sharper,
                            from $495 million (47 percent) in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961
                            to $139 million (17 percent) in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1962.</p>
                        <p>We have been most concerned about the prospect of rising cash transfers
                            to aid recipients, especially for local costs of development programs in
                            Latin America and Africa. Some increase in this type of expend-iture is
                            an inevitable result of the Alliance for Progress program and of the new
                            role thrust on the U.S. in Africa. One way of reducing to some extent
                            the balance of payments impact of this type of expenditure is to limit
                            the ultimate use of the dollars involved to U.S. exports of goods and
                            services. General arrangements for the establishment for this purpose of
                            restricted accounts in the Treasury, and for the treatment of these
                            transactions in our balance of payments presentations, have been agreed

                        <p>The Bureau of the Budget has now instituted, after discussion with other

                            and approval by you, a Government-wide control system for international
                            transactions of Federal agencies. This system submits to a separate

                            process, anticipated expenditures abroad of most Federal agencies. The

                        <p>In the longer run we can succeed in building the kind of international
                            economy in which we want to live, not by restrictive measures, but only
                            by fostering an expanding world economy which provides greater
                            opportunities for us as well as others and by competing effectively
                            within this system. A most basic aspect of this is our export promotion
                            drive.</p>

                        <p>Price stability and an efficient, modern industry—able to compete
                            successfully in world markets in terms of new products, delivery
                            schedules, and quality as well as price—are the essential underpinnings
                            of a larger trade balance. Our ultimate success in this area will
                            reflect the performance of our whole economy—labor, business, and
                            agriculture alike—over the months and years ahead, rather than any
                            dramatic single action by the Government. Government does, however, have
                            a responsibility for helping to create an environment conducive to rapid
                            growth within a context of stable prices.</p>
                        <p>One important recent action in this connection was the Treasury
                            Department announcement on July 12 of a fundamental reform in the tax
                            treatment of depreciation.<note n="2" xml:id="d18fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> According to Treasury estimates, the new
                            guidelines will be reflected in additional depreciation writeoffs
                            approaching $3.4 billion in the first year.</p>
                        <p>A companion measure—a tax credit equivalent to seven percent of new
                            investment in equipment—is incorporated in the tax bill which has now
                            been passed by the Congress. Together with the depreciation reform, this
                            measure will provide tax treatment for investment in new equipment in
                            the United States more nearly comparable to that provided in other
                            industrialized countries.</p>
                        <p>Productivity gains since early 1961 have been gratifyingly large,
                            although a large part of the improvement was admittedly cyclical.
                            Meanwhile, wage increases have generally been moderate and unit labor
                            costs <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0065"/>in manufacturing are now
                            lower than they were in 1959, at a comparable stage of economic
                            recovery. The past three years have represented an exceptional period of
                            industrial price stability during the postwar period.</p>

                            competitiveness. But even the best mouse trap doesn't sell itself in
                            today's world. Our second major line of attack, therefore, has been the
                            active promotional efforts which are necessary if we are to maintain or
                            increase the U.S. share of total world exports. On July 17, Mr. Draper
                            Daniels entered on duty in the Department of Commerce as National Export
                            Coordinator, charged with giving increased impetus to all our varied
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>The program of export credit insurance begun on February 3 has met with a
                            favorable reception. By the end of June the Foreign Credit Insurance
                            Association, which now has 71 member companies, had issued 685 policies
                            covering $331 million of anticipated exports during the policy year. On
                            July 2, FCIA broadened the cover to include, at the option of the
                            exporter, protection from the date he accepts the sales order.</p>
                        <p>On July 16, FCIA and the Export-Import Bank announced the availability of
                            policies to cover export credits with terms up to 5 years.<note n="3"

                            earlier system of guarantees to commercial banks on medium-term export
                            sales, American exporters now have credit facilities more nearly equal
                            to those anywhere in the world.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Commerce has continued its efforts to stimulate
                            business interest in exports. The National Export Expansion Council, its
                            33 associated Regional Councils, the President's “E” Export Award, the
                            transformation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Commerce Weekly</hi>
                            into the new <hi rend="italic">International Commerce</hi> weekly news
                            magazine, and the continued expansion of existing Foreign Service and
                            Commerce assistance to businessmen, have all contributed to a marked
                            increase in interest in exporting. This interest has been demonstrated
                            by increased demands for services from the Commerce Department and its
                            field offices throughout the United States, increased business purchases
                            from Commerce of trade lists, World Trade Directory reports, and trade
                            contact surveys, and the borrowing by businessmen of almost twice as
                            many commodity, economic and industry reports, submitted from Foreign
                            Service posts around the world, as in the first six months of last
                            year.</p>
                        <p>State and Commerce have actively sought to interest foreign buyers
                            through participation in trade fairs, trade centers and trade missions
                            as well as by more traditional trade opportunity information programs.
                                <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0066"/>During the half year, more
                            than 2.3 million people visited U.S. exhibitions in six international
                            trade fairs on four continents. Two trade centers, which are permanent
                            marketing sites, have been opened in London and Bangkok. A third will
                            open shortly in Frankfurt.</p>
                        <p>Continued U.S. representations to foreign countries have contributed to
                            the removal of most unjustifiable quantitative restrictions on imports
                            of U.S. industrial products. Quantitative restrictions against
                            agricultural products remain a problem, but our efforts have secured
                            some degree of liberalization in a number of Western European countries
                            and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The United States and the other countries with whom we negotiated tariff
                            concessions at the Geneva tariff conference took the necessary legal
                            actions to begin bringing these concessions into effect July 1, 1962 or
                            shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Congress has now completed action on the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,
                            giving you substantially the authority you requested.</p>

                                United States</hi></p>
                        <p>Offices of the United States Travel Service have been established in
                            eight foreign cities, and its personnel are working in 30 foreign
                            countries. Visa procedures have been greatly simplified. A major
                            additional step, which recently has been announced, is the waiver of
                            personal appearances in most countries. The Travel Service has been
                            working with U.S. communities to seek to insure that travelers to the
                            United States receive a more cordial welcome.</p>
                        <p>Based on data for the first six months, the number of overseas visitors
                            to the United States increased 18 percent over last year. During the
                            same period, the number of visitors from countries in which the Travel
                            Service has mounted a promotional effort rose 21 percent. U.S. tourist
                            travel to other countries has also been increasing, however, with the
                            result that the “travel deficit” is still growing rather than declining.
                            Nevertheless, sample Customs data for the first seven months of this
                            year indicate that, if the trend continues for the balance of the year,
                            the reduced exemptions will cause American tourists to buy perhaps $90
                            million less abroad than they otherwise would have.</p>

                        <p>To reduce our long-term net capital outflow, we have sought to increase
                            the attractiveness of foreign investment in the United States, to reduce
                            certain tax incentives which presently favor American investment abroad,
                            and to continue our long-standing efforts to persuade the Europeans to
                            adopt measures to make capital outflows more possible. In essence, we
                            have sought liberalization by Europe rather than restrictive action by
                            the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0067"/>
                        <p>Continuing efforts to find foreign capital sources interested in
                            investment in the U.S. have resulted in several small new European
                            direct investments. Commerce is continuing to seek foreign enterprises
                            interested in establishing operations in the United States, with
                            modestly growing interest from abroad. This activity is particularly
                            keyed in with the <gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss> program of
                            assistance to labor surplus areas.</p>
                        <p>We have also sought to impress upon our European friends the importance
                            of developing European capital markets and of opening them up to permit
                            a freer flow of capital to the U.S. and to the less developed countries.
                            I made this the theme of my talk to the American Bankers Association
                            conference in Rome in May. Although we would not wish for, or expect,
                            the United States to cease to be a supplier of capital to the world, it
                            would be of benefit to both ourselves and to borrowers if European
                            capital markets were expanded so that it would not be necessary for so
                            many borrowers to look only to the United States market as is now the
                            case. In recent months, significant relaxations of capital restrictions
                            have been made by France, Austria and Spain.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Role of Other Countries</p>
                        <p>In recent years other countries have assumed a greater degree of
                            international financial responsibility. The most dramatic results for
                            our balance of payments have been the military offset arrangements
                            already discussed, and the large prepayments of debts owed the U.S.
                            Government by European countries in surplus positions. Of a longer range
                            character are the measures to induce other countries to extend more
                            financing to less-developed countries, and measures of international
                            cooperation among monetary authorities.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Debt Prepayments</hi></p>
                        <p>Because they provide maximum balance-of-payments assistance during the
                            period before our long-run measures achieve their full effects, we have
                            given high priority to securing advance repayments of obligations owed
                            the U.S. Government by countries in substantial surplus positions.
                            France and Sweden have now joined the list of countries that made
                            special debt prepayments last year—the Federal Republic of Germany, the
                            Netherlands, and Italy—and Italy made a substantial additional
                            prepayment in July. Total special receipts from these sources in the
                            second and third quarters amounted to almost $550 million.</p>

                        <p>Although this type of operation does not directly affect the deficit in
                            our balance of payments in a statistical sense, it helps by reducing
                            gold outflows to maintain confidence in the dollar and reduce
                            speculative short-term outflows of capital that have an adverse effect
                            on our balance.</p>
                        <p>In addition, forward exchange operations of the sort initiated last year
                            have been continued by the Treasury. These operations are primarily
                            designed to keep forward exchange rates from moving out of line with
                            their interest rate parities and thereby make it unprofitable for
                            short-term capital to flow abroad because of higher foreign interest
                            rates.</p>
                        <p>Cooperative arrangements among central banks of the so-called Basle group
                            have contributed to the stability of the price of gold in the London
                            market. Growing nervousness in the exchange markets in late June and
                            July led to pressure on the gold market, which was reversed after your
                            press conference on July 23.<note n="5" xml:id="d18fn5">For the

                        <p>It is most unlikely that we can achieve the goal of balance in our
                            international accounts by the end of 1963. In fact, 1965 looks like the
                            earliest <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0070"/>realistic target year,
                            and that may be optimistic. We have cut the proportion of government
                            grants and loans which result in dollar outflows from about 36% in
                            calendar year 1960 to about 24% for last year, and we expect to get it
                            below 20% in the next year. It will be difficult to cut it any further.
                            We are still reducing net military expenditures abroad, mostly by
                            increasing use of offset arrangements with our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Allies. We also propose to negotiate offset
                            arrangements with Spain and Japan. Here, as in the loans and grants
                            fields, we are running into diminishing returns. Nonetheless, the
                            importance of maintaining these efforts is great.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately we must look for a solution to the balance of payments problem
                            in a substantial increase in our exports, unless we are to make
                            fundamental changes in our foreign commitments. This is mainly a matter
                            of domestic economic policy, in keeping our products competitive in
                            world markets in terms of price and quality. However, it also depends on
                            conscious effort, both in trade negotiations and export promotion. We
                            are expanding export promotion programs for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>It is clear that the importance of monetary arrangements which serve to
                            defend the dollar will remain<note n="1" xml:id="d19fn1">The word
                                “important” has been crossed out at this point.</note> through the
                            next several years, and that we can count on Treasury's continued
                            ingenious efforts to deal with this problem. But we must not look on it
                            as a technical monetary problem alone, but also as an important problem
                            of foreign policy in which joint action among the leading Western
                            nations in a variety of ways will continue to be of the greatest
                            importance.</p>

                        <p>The President began by pointing out that we are facing the same problem
                            that had been developing since 1957, and asked Mr. Acheson whether
                            earlier action by the last Administration could not have improved
                            matters. Mr. Acheson said he thought that if the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration had
                            undertaken the measures which had been developed in the last two years,
                            they could have cut the annual deficit in half to about $2 billion. Mr.
                            Acheson further remarked that the optimistic hopes of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Treasury would have been right
                            if exports had held up as hoped. The President asked about the problem
                            of capital outflow, and expressed his feeling that it was really not
                            sensible for Henry Ford to be able to lay hands on $300 million of
                            America's gold reserve by a single private decision. Mr. Acheson
                            expressed agreement, and said that one way of limiting capital outflow
                            might be to put a tax on it. The President asked whether we might not
                            have a law similar to that in Switzerland, and Mr. Acheson replied that
                            most such laws were easily avoided when it was a capital flight that is
                            intended, but he repeated that taxes might limit investment. On this
                            same problem of investment, Mr. Acheson noted that our foreign
                            investments have been about equal to our net outflow of dollars, and he
                            remarked that if costs should continue to rise in Europe and if they can
                            be held in line in this country, this foreign investment flow might be
                            cut down and perhaps even reversed. The President noted, and Mr. Acheson
                            agreed, that on the other hand we could expect to take some losses on
                            agricultural exports.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. Acheson about the possibility of raising interest
                            rates to hold money here, and Mr. Acheson remarked that this would hold
                            short-term money but that such action would run the risk of <pb n="46"
                                xml:id="pg_46" facs="0072"/>slowing down economic growth in the US,
                            and he indicated that he would not welcome this particular move at
                            present.</p>
                        <p>Turning to his basic proposals, Mr. Acheson remarked that the whole
                            object was to get a period of time in which it would not be necessary to
                            use small expedients with troublesome side effects. If things went well
                            during this period of time, no more drastic action would be needed, and
                            if not, there would be time to note the trend and take other measures.
                            Mr. Acheson said that over a similar period of time he thought that we
                            would get a clear notion of what the Europeans will and will not do in
                            such fields as military strategy and deployment, and that if they would
                                not<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">The word “not” has been inserted by
                                hand.</note> meet our standards, we could make careful plans for
                            appropriate rearrangement of our own commitments. The President
                            expressed his concern at the possibility that he might be forced to make
                            major political or military adjustments for balance of payments reasons
                            at a time when tourists alone represented a billion dollar drain—since
                            tourists contributed nothing of major significance to the national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Acheson continued with a description of his basic plan, remarking
                            that most of the borrowing should be done in France and Germany, and he
                            expressed his belief that both the French and the Germans would be
                            willing in fact to cooperate. In his view a persuasive argument could be
                            made that the United States was facing these difficulties not because
                            things are going badly, but because they are going well, and that the
                            proposed program is in their interest as well as in ours. Mr. Acheson
                            believed that the French would enjoy being able to cooperate in this
                            particular field, and he did not expect that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> would attempt to use the
                            monetary weapon for his quite different political purposes. In response
                            to a question from Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName>Acheson</persName> remarked that he believed the ten
                            billion dollar figure was adequate in size, and the balance of its
                            distribution among the different categories was satisfactory. He was not
                            troubled by the prospect of reduction in the gold balance, since he
                            believed that in any long-term rearrangement of international monetary
                            practices, there would have to be a reduction in gold holdings in any
                            case. He believed that the gold cover requirement which could be waived
                            if necessary by the Federal Reserve was not a serious obstacle if
                            carefully approached.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked on the difficulty of getting State and Treas-ury
                            together. Mr. Acheson repeated that one difficulty was that the
                            Secretary of State expressed his own lack of interest and concern, while
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> took a breezy attitude
                            which was very frightening to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1"
                                >Roosa</persName>. The President indicated his understanding of this
                            difficulty but said that we should not leave this matter simply to the
                            bankers. Mr. Acheson agreed, but he remarked that now Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> was deeply concerned and that <pb
                                n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0073"/>indeed his own proposal was one
                            which had been put to him first by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1"
                                >Roosa</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief discussion of devaluation in which the President
                            remarked that his own view had been that one difficulty in devaluation
                            was that others would promptly follow suit, and the second difficulty
                            was that dollars would not be held with great confidence thereafter. Mr.
                            Acheson indicated his own view that devaluation was neither a great
                            terror nor an immediate answer to the problem. A better answer would be
                            selective revaluation of unusually strong currencies, but this was not
                            currently likely. The President and Mr. Acheson exchanged with good
                            cheer the thought that it would be pleasant to close down one or two
                            bases in Spain and to discourage the Spaniards from supposing that they
                            could draw gold and hold us up on the military front, both at the same
                            time.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Mr. Acheson would talk privately with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> very soon and that at
                            the end of the week there would be a meeting for discussion of the

                                are given a proper weight in any transactions we have with them.
                                Conversely, we must be sure that any financial transactions and
                                arrangements we make with other countries tie in with our broader

                                countries, give special attention to this point. He should see that

                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> submitted a 31-page
                            report prepared by the Cabinet Committee on Balance of Payments, which
                            reexamined the problem of balance of payments. (Kennedy Library,

                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> announced a meeting on
                            Thursday, April 18, at 10 a.m. to discuss thoroughly the alternative
                            proposals for further actions to reduce or finance the anticipated
                            balance-of-payments deficit over the next 2 years. He proposed that
                            those who had put forward proposals on which there was not general
                            agreement should be prepared to explain and defend them at the meeting,
                            and he indicated specific items that the Department of State, Council of
                            Economic Advisers, and Department of the Treasury should be prepared to
                            discuss. He also indicated he was ready to explore other options raised
                            in the Cabinet Committee's report. (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by asking Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> what was the basis for the
                            assumption that our balance of payments would be in good shape in 1965.
                            He referred to the different view that Mr. Acheson's paper
                                suggested.<note n="1" xml:id="d24fn1">See <ref target="#d20fn3"

                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> responded that it was the
                            general opinion that there would be a substantial improvement in
                            evidence by 1965 or perhaps late 1964, although it was not expected that
                            our accounts would be in balance by then. This opinion had been
                            expressed in the Brookings report.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">Not
                                further identified.</note> It was shared by the staff of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> officers and most of the important European central
                            bankers with whom he was in touch. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> then listed the major developments which were
                            prospectively favorable. As far as trade went, European prices could be
                            expected to increase relative to those of the U.S. The possibilities of
                            the continued squeezing of European business profits between rising
                            costs and less rapidly rising prices were about exhausted, and this and
                            other forces would continue to drive European prices up. We could also
                            expect improvements in the investment account. Much of the U.S.
                            investment in Western Europe has been a one-time matter in response to
                            the new political stability in Western Europe and the reappearance of
                            convertibility for European currencies. This was already beginning to
                            decline. Further, higher rate of economic activity in the U.S. would
                            make investment here more attractive. On the other side of the ledger,
                            income from assets held abroad was rising and would continue to rise.
                            Each of the years 1961 and 1962 had shown a $300 million increase in net
                            income <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0078"/>from foreign investments
                            over its predecessors. The basic deficit which had been less than a
                            billion dollars in 1961 and was a little over a billion dollars in 1962
                            could thus be expected to decline. On the other hand, short term capital
                            movements were unpredictable and still presented a problem. Our
                            out-flows on short term capital account had been $2 billion in 1961 and
                            $1.7 billion by last year. Here the question of interest rates was
                            important, but even in the short-term accounts there were countervailing
                            factors. For instance, there had been in the last year a return of
                            flight capital to Europe, much of which was probably concealed in the
                            “errors and omissions” category. It was Secretary Dillon's judgment that
                            this too was coming to an end. These optimistic forecasts were based on
                            the assumption that U.S. foreign expenditures in the military and
                            foreign aid fields continued to be held down. In sum, daylight some time
                            in the period 1965-66-67 was perfectly visible, and accordingly there
                            was no reason for drastic actions now which would upset the dollar and
                            have an adverse reaction on the whole international payments situation.
                            On the other hand, if by the end of 1964 progress was not in accord-ance
                            with expectations, we would have another look at the problem. It had
                            clearly been a mistake to fix on 1963 as a definite target year in which
                            balance would come.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> and asked him to summarize the State Department
                            paper on restricting the access to our capital market for foreign
                            security quotations.<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">Not further
                                identified.</note> Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> opened by saying that the notion of restricting
                            foreign security sales was not one in which he saw any positive merit.
                            For example, he thought it should be much lower on the priority list
                            than either an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> drawing or a
                            political negotiation for substantial government loans. However, if
                            these are not possible, then the proposal should be given serious
                            consideration. Secretary Ball reviewed the factual situation as set
                            forth in his memorandum, with emphasis on the increasing use of the U.S.
                            market, especially by Canadians. It was clear that we could not make a
                            blanket prohibition and would have to find some way of dealing with
                            genuine Japanese and Canadian needs. What was needed was some machinery
                            for selective control. In his judgment, this could be accomplished
                            without legislation; and simultaneously, informal talks could be had
                            with the Canadians on what their needs were, but rigorous standards
                            applied to the Europeans. On this basis he thought we might save
                            something between $400-$600 million annually on the investment account.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that the
                            next Finance Minister of Canada, Walter Gordon, was in favor of “buying
                            back Canada” and therefore might well be sympathetic to the program. He
                            was confident that if we had the control machinery to back up our
                            position, we could come to an understanding with the Canadians.</p>
                        <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0079"/>
                        <p>While he recognized the dangers of any restrictive action, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> gave his judgment that
                            it would be much better to restrict foreign securities flotation than to
                            make any large troop redeployments or to impose regressive taxes on
                            tourism. Responding to the President's question, he said that foreign
                            securities sales amounted to about ten per cent of total flotations in
                            our markets.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, responding to
                            the President's request for criticism of the proposal, made two chief
                            points. First, he does not share the State Department estimate of the
                            savings the proposed measure would yield. Second, the risk that any
                            restriction would provoke a general capital flight was simply not worth
                            taking. He then went on to develop his points in further detail. Most of
                            the potential yield was in Canada. Canadian loans last year were
                            exceptional in volume and character, and he did not expect they would be
                            repeated on a similar scale. If we restricted Canadian borrowing, there
                            would be an adverse affect on U.S. exports to Canada, since Canada
                            itself had anything but an easy balance of payments situation and we
                            were their major supplier. Further, the Canadians did not demand gold,
                            but held their dollar balances cheerfully. The Japanese situation was
                            similar. As for the rest, other than Canada and Japan, there was little
                            in it. With respect to international institutions, we already had
                            controls. Last year's European borrowings of $200 million will decline.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> has already made
                            informal representations to some European governments and he will make
                            further representations. Of the rest, Israel took $50 million, and thus
                            would be politically difficult to cut down. Australia and New Zealand,
                            which had taken $80 or $90 million last year were already reaching the
                            limitation of their capacity to carry external debt. Further, the New
                            York insurance companies who were the chief buyers of this kind of
                            security were nearing their own limitations on further holdings. In sum,
                            the whole enterprise would yield at most $200 million a year. Since he
                            thought the chances were 100 to 1 that this activity would trigger a
                            mass capital out-flow in which we could lose $1 or $2 billion in assets,
                            and in turn force us to an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> drawing
                            with all that it implies, he could not see why we should consider it
                            seriously. Further, there was a legal problem. We might need a
                            proclamation of a new emergency which in itself would have an effect on
                            confidence. The classification of our allies as “enemies” to be dealt
                            with under the Trading With the Enemy Act was troublesome.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> then asked
                            Chairman <persName>Martin</persName> for his view. Chairman
                                <persName>Martin</persName> talked about the evanescent character of
                            business confidence. We were facing the real possibility of a crisis.
                            While he did not want to be a Cassandra, he thought it was necessary to
                            warn of what could happen. Liberal policies in trade and in investment
                            matters have been our tradition. We should have the strength and the
                            courage to follow them. If that tradition were impaired, we would start
                            undermining <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0080"/>the entire fabric of
                            our liberal policy and all that goes with it, and the confidence which
                            rests on that policy. His own experience with operating voluntary credit
                            controls during the Korean War made him aware of the great difficulties
                            that the operation of a Capital Issues Committee would involve. If this
                            were a dramatic move which added to our resources, Chairman
                                <persName>Martin</persName> could see some argument for it. But
                            since the forces of the market are working with us we should cooperate
                            rather than oppose them. We should not show the white feather unless we
                            are against the wall.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what happens when our gold reserves get down to $13
                            billion. Of course we can suspend the reserve requirement but what
                            effect will that have on confidence? Chairman
                                <persName>Martin</persName> said that we had to hold clearly to our
                            1961 policy statement: no embargo on gold movements; no direct controls.
                            There was virtue in maintaining a strong line; as soon as we weaken
                            foreign speculators and central banks would doubt our determination and
                            confidence would drop. Liberal trade policies were, after all, our
                            ultimate goal. If foreign countries had different trade and investment
                            policies, we should not by any means follow their bad example. If
                            necessary, we may have to take the risks of putting deflationary
                            pressure on the economy through monetary policies. But since the
                            favorable forces of expansion were operating to make investment in the
                            U.S. more attractive, it seemed unwise to interfere with them by
                            imposing direct controls. In sum, we should hold the line on our liberal
                            policies. We need the courage and guts to stick to our policy and not
                            allow ourselves to be put on the defensive.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> for his comments. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that his chief difference
                            with the Secretary of the Treasury was with respect to the amount of
                            risk we should be prepared to accept. He shared Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>'s assumptions as to the
                            favorable outlook for the future. However, we need a prudent policy
                            which guards against the possibility of a worse outcome. It is clear
                            that we have been too optimistic since 1961. If we are forced to take
                            measures to defend the dollar under pressure it will be dangerous from
                            the point of view of the national interest. We need to act now so as to
                            provide a greater margin within which we can rely on the long range
                            forces to improve our position. Further, we had to look to the future of
                            the international payments system, especially in relation to the
                            situation when we move into surplus. An American surplus might well
                            aggravate liquidity problems. As far as the issue of confidence and
                            leadership went, he thought that departure from the strict fidelity to
                            free capital movement was much less of a threat than the possibility
                            that we might deflate our domestic economy. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stressed that he was not in any
                            way suggesting restriction on foreign flotations in the U.S. as a matter
                            of first priority, and repeated <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0081"
                            />his concern that the policies advocated by the Secretary of the
                            Treasury involved an unnecessarily large measure of risk.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> agreed that the
                            margin on which we were operating was narrow. However, it was he and the
                            Treasury who were conservative, and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s proposal which was reckless. He
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, however,
                            agreed that the issue was really one of priority. In his view once we
                            start down the road of exchange controls and the like, it would be very
                            difficult to stop and the effects on confidence would be clear.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to the question of a possible drawing on the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. He read from paragraph A. of
                            the Council paper<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> and noted the assumptions contained therein that
                            we would face a gross deficit of $6 billion in the period 1963-64 and
                            that we had to manage our affairs so that we financed no more than $1
                            billion of this deficit each year through gold losses. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that the
                            figure of $6 billion was inaccurate. We proposed to reduce the out-flow
                            as the Cabinet Committee paper showed, so that the deficit was in fact
                            less than that. If we were successful in reducing the out-flow we could
                            finance the deficits on the present basis for as long a period in the
                            future as necessary. He called on Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> to comment on this point.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> defined our
                            problem as that of any other borrower—how to keep our credit standing
                            good. This meant primarily two things. First, general confidence in our
                            financial policy and second, clear evidence that the government is doing
                            a comprehensive job in reducing unnecessary expenditures abroad. While
                            he professed no expertise in these matters, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> thought it was highly desirable
                            that if there was any excess fat in our military abroad, we should trim
                            it off. This would have a favorable effect on the opinion of the
                            European financial community. A reduction in tourist expenditures would
                            likewise have a favorable effect on the European financial community.
                            The President asked if this would also be true of U.S. foreign
                            investment. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>
                            replied that it would, but this was a matter on which the Europeans will
                            be taking action. He then stressed the importance of interest rates and
                            quoted Van Lennep (the Director General of the Dutch Ministry of Finance
                            and the Chairman of Working Party #3) to the effect that a half percent
                            rise in the U.S. short rates would be a very important demonstration of
                            our determination to deal with the balance of payments problems.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> went on to talk
                            about the difficulties of estimating what gold sales would be and how
                            undependable the figure was on the distribution of deficits and
                            surpluses in Europe. The Swedes, for example, had just told him that
                            they were willing to hold their dollar balances without asking for gold,
                            and as long as confidence in our policy existed, it was clear they <pb
                                n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0082"/>would continue to do so. The
                            President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>
                            what was his estimate of the gold loss for 1963-64. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> responded that he thought it
                            would be of the same order of magnitude as in the last two years—about
                            $850 million per year or perhaps less. However, he did not wish to
                            promise that the figure would not exceed this, because there were so
                            many variables involved. He reported on his recent favorable discussions
                            with the French, but pointed out that a change in French political
                            attitudes in respect to financial questions might lead to a change in
                            French behavior and a corresponding increase in our loss of gold.
                            Nonetheless, we could sustain gold losses up to $1 billion per year with
                            no strongly adverse effects. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1"
                                >Roosa</persName> stressed the crucial importance of avoiding in any
                            way the suggestion that we had lost our nerve. He said that the efforts
                            of the last two years have saved us at least $3 billion in gold in a
                            direct sense. If we had lost the extra $3 billion we would have in fact
                            lost much more because of the alarm that this would have created.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that the
                            program of action that the Committee was presenting to the President
                            would take effect primarily in Calendar year 1964 because of the lags
                            involved. The same thing would be true of the change in monetary policy
                            which was proposed for the fall of 1963. Thus his estimate was that
                            while the gold loss would be between $800 million and $1 billion in
                            1963, it would drop off to something between $500 million and $600
                            million in 1964.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the question of an <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> drawing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1"
                                >Roosa</persName> said we should certainly bear the possibility in
                            mind but at present he would like to save it. We have already worked out
                            the arrangements with <persName corresp="#p_JP5">Per
                                Jacobsson</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> for
                            making a drawing. His own soundings in Europe on the advisability of a
                            drawing were still producing negative results. It would take more time
                            to prepare the Europeans. The Italians, in particular, have bluntly
                            warned us against making a drawing on the grounds that it would shock
                            Europe if the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> drew at the
                            same time. All the Europeans expected the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> would be forced to draw. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> distinguished between the notion
                            of any large drawing either up to our gold tranche of approximately $1
                            billion or up to our first credit tranche of approximately another $1
                            billion, and the idea of an ice-breaking small technical drawing in
                            relation to Canadian repayment. He was strongly against a big drawing.
                            The Council's analysis of the resources of the Fund was incorrect. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> must draw and will probably draw
                            $1 billion since the Fund's assets are $2.2 billion in gold and $1.2
                            billion in hard European currencies. The reserves of hard currencies
                            after a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> drawing would be small. The
                            Fund could sell some gold but if we came in for a drawing on top of a
                            British drawing the Fund would have to sell substantial amounts of gold
                            or activate special borrowing arrangements. If so, our whole financial
                            program would have to be examined at greater detail under the terms of
                            the special arrangements. If the Fund sold gold <pb n="57"
                                xml:id="pg_57" facs="0083"/>in any substantial amounts, it would
                            almost certainly ask for the return of the $800 million in Fund gold on
                            deposit with the U.S. This would cancel the gain to us of the drawing.
                            The Canadian situation has changed and the Canadians are not planning to
                            make any repayment this year except for $25 million in gold. Therefore,
                            the occasion for a technical drawing will not present itself now.
                            However, if the British make a drawing we could then examine the
                            situation and see whether a technical drawing was possible. None of
                            this, of course, was a substitute for the action program. In this
                            respect Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> called
                            attention to the fact that the $6 billion in the Council memo assumed
                            that there was no action program.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> reminded the group
                            that our basic goal was not merely to save gold, but to do it in a way
                            that kept domestic expansion going and our liberal international
                            policies intact as well. We are all assuming that what we are faced with
                            is a transitional problem rather than a permanent one. In this case it
                            is wise to take the easy measures first and to be sure that the more
                            distasteful measures are available and arranged in order of priority. In
                            his view there was no easier way to get $1 to $2 billion additional in
                            foreign resources than to make a drawing on the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>, at least up to our gold tranche. His analysis of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> reserves was different than the
                            Treasury's. There was $4.4 billion in gold and hard currency: $1 billion
                            drawn by the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and $1 billion drawn by
                            the U.S. would still leave $2.4 billion in ready <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> reserves in addition to the $3 billion which the
                            standby agreement would provide if necessary. Thus both we and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could draw and still leave an
                            emergency reserve of nearly $5.5 billion. The President asked what
                            advantage there would be in an <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            drawing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            interrupted to remark again on the futility of drawing $1 billion if the
                            result was that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> withdrew its
                            deposit with the U.S. of $800 million in gold. Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> responded that this was an
                            unrealistic view. <persName corresp="#p_JP5">Per Jacobsson</persName>
                            favored active use of the Fund, and he would not act so as stand in the
                            way of it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said
                            that a technical drawing on the Fund was acceptable. Any big drawing,
                            however, must wait on the actions of the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>. In the meantime we must continue to talk to the
                            Europeans and the New York financial community to prepare them for the
                            possibility of drawing. After all, we could not take actions which would
                            lead to headlines of the “U.S. Admits Bankruptcy; Goes to <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>” sort.</p>
                        <p>Chairman <persName corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> pointed out that
                            we could draw European currency and at the same time the Fund could sell
                            gold to the Europeans. This would have the double advantage of
                            increasing our supply of European currencies at the same time that their
                            hunger for gold was appeased. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1"
                                >Roosa</persName> responded that the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> does not think that their present gold stock is large.
                            Furthermore, since they don't expect any further payments in gold they
                            want to hang on to their present holdings. He again <pb n="58"
                                xml:id="pg_58" facs="0084"/>raised the question of what must sooner
                            or later happen to the $800 million in gold that the Fund has on deposit
                            with the U.S. Mr. Tobin pointed out that it is hard to believe that the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would be acting against us at
                            the same moment that we make a drawing. This simply was not sensible.
                            Further, he was not proposing that the U.S. draw $1 billion all at once,
                            but rather that we make drawings over a period of time, in installments
                            which would total between $1 and $2 billion in the course of the next
                            two years.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. Tobin whether he was in favor of a drawing. Mr.
                            Tobin responded yes, of course. Our ability to make use of the Fund in a
                            technical way as we did in the past is now at an end because the Fund's
                            holdings of dollars are up to its limit. Drawings in small amounts as a
                            regular routine matter would simply represent a continuation of our past
                            policies in the new technical situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JP5"
                                >Jacobsson</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> could make it perfectly clear to the financial
                            community what was happening, and the whole operation could be carried
                            on in a way that would not shake confidence any more than it has done in
                            the past.</p>
                        <p>The President then moved to the question of political loans. He asked
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> what the
                            prospects were for funding existing dollar holdings and for additional
                            five-year loans along the lines suggested in Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s paper. Was there a parliamentary
                            problem? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            interrupted to remark that the proposal envisioned financing that would
                            be done by central banks and not through government budgets. The basic
                            question, however, was the necessity for a political decision by
                            governments to ask their central banks to go beyond existing practices
                            with respect to financing U.S. deficits. He said this was something
                            which we obviously would start with the Germans and then the Italians.
                            He sketched the plan further, along the lines of his paper. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> pointed out that in
                            his judgment it would be very difficult to achieve these arrangements,
                            and further, with all the difficulty, it would accomplish nothing beyond
                            what we already have done. The present two year loans will be rolled
                            over and renewed as long as necessary. In fact, the amounts we now have
                            outstanding and the agreements for further amounts up to our needs go to
                            the full extent of the future surpluses of the Germans, Italians, French
                            and Belgians. Thus the $1.2 billion mentioned in the Cabinet Committee
                            paper as the available magnitude of financing of this nature does not
                            accurately reflect the maximum amount that will in fact be
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that the
                            Treasury was addressing itself to the easy case of the financing which
                            would be available if the U.S. balance of payments was moving in a
                            favorable way. The problem was, however, what would happen if we did not
                            do well. It was in these circumstances that advance agreement was
                            important and it was precisely in these circumstances that the
                            arrangements we now have might prove unreliable. <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0085"/>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> responded that it would undoubtedly be desirable
                            to get the kind of commitments of which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> had spoken, but he did not think it possible. We
                            now have oral, informal understandings. Any formal contracts were much
                            more difficult to achieve, and if achieved, they would probably involve
                            much harder terms. The Bundesbank was at least as independent as the
                            Federal Reserve System. (Laughter.) Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> noted that the Bundesbank and the
                            subsidiary of the Italian central bank which deals with foreign exchange
                            have full authority in the foreign fields and are not subject to
                            instruction by the government. In particular, the head of the Italian
                            activity was independent of the government. He had pointed out to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> in conversation that he
                            was satisfied with the present arrangements, but if the politicians got
                            into it there would be no money.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether it was clearly the Treasury's position that
                            we could not go in any formal way beyond what we now have in either
                            standstill understanding and lines of credit? Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> responded affirmatively. The
                            President asked whether this statement applied to 5 year loans. Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> responded that we
                            could edge up toward 5 year loans slowly and in one country at a time,
                            but we could not get there in one or a few large leaps.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called attention to
                            page 5 of the Cabinet Committee report and stated again that this was a
                            good financing scheme if things went well. What if they did not? Messrs.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> said we would call on the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. Chairman <persName corresp="#p_HWW1"
                                >Heller</persName> remarked that they pictured this as an extreme
                            emergency measure. What was in between the emergency measure and the
                            favorable situation anticipated in the Cabinet Committee report?
                                <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> responded that what we
                            are now doing can handle such a situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked what would
                            happen if in the middle of 1964 the situation was no better than it is
                            now. Wouldn't it then be harder to try to make any new arrangements?
                            Wouldn't it be more difficult to go to the Fund then than it is now? We
                            have been talking about a great catastrophe, but this is unlikely. What
                            is likely is the continuation of our past experience of over-optimism
                            and failure to be able to take measures unilaterally which meet the
                            deficit in the next short period. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said that world opinion was favorable to the
                            United States. We had either to take advantage of this and continue what
                            we are doing or immediately do a handful of major operations at the risk
                            of changing the favorable opinion abroad. The President observed that
                            this was precisely the central point. He then referred to the very
                            difficult experiences of the fall of 1960 and asked whether the fall of
                            1964 and the discussion incident to another campaign might not bring a
                            similar experience. Do we have the groundwork laid in the London gold
                            market to avoid this? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> responded affirmatively. In 1960 we were totally
                            unprepared to deal <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0086"/>with gold
                            speculation. We now have an understanding with all the major countries,
                            and we could and would keep prices in the London gold market down so
                            that another speculative burst like that of the fall of 1960 will not
                            recur.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> what his plans were with respect to Defense
                            outlays on foreign account. What was the present situation and what did
                            he have in mind? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> responded that as of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1963 he expected to be losing about $1.6 to $1.7 billion
                            on foreign account. With present programs, and on the assumptions that
                            the Germans continue to buy about $600 million a year under the offset
                            agreement, this figure would be constant for the next two or three
                            years. However, he was doubtful whether in fact the Germans would
                            continue to purchase at this rate for more than another year, and we
                            must be prepared to meet the contingency of decreased income from that
                            source. The only way to improve our position was to reduce troop
                            deployments. It was his judgment that this can be done without reducing
                            our effective military strength; the problem was largely political
                            rather than military. In response to the President's question, he said
                            that half of the expenditures were for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>; the other half all around the rest of the world with
                            Japan being one of the major areas. The President asked how we could put
                            the political issue to the Europeans. He then referred to the
                            conversations that he, the Secretary of Defense and the Chiefs had had
                            on troop deployments in December. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> responded that it was not the time to raise the
                            issue that was then discussed. What we can do now is thin out our
                            deployments in Europe in terms of troops per combat unit, without
                            reducing the number or strength of our combat units. Thus we would
                            reduce the supporting forces and accompanying dependents. On this basis
                            he expects to be able to reduce the annual rate of net foreign outlays
                            by $300-$400 million below the current one by the end of Calendar year
                            1964. These reductions will take place mainly in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Germany, France, Spain and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>
                            about <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s plans. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> responded that in the same period
                            their net outlays would be reduced to an annual rate of $500 million or
                            below.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to the question of the future growth in our export
                            trade. What were the prospects for agriculture and for exports of
                            aircraft? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            commented on our cotton sales, and the loss in market share over the
                            last several years due to a poor pricing method which had made us the
                            residual supplier. The Department of Agriculture was now moving to
                            selling on an auction basis, in an attempt to get back to our previous
                            position of 5 million bales from our present sales of 4 million bales
                            per year. The President asked whether this was enough and what the
                            broader prospects for agricultural trade were. Governor Herter spoke of
                            the Japanese commitments to increase their imports of U.S. agricultural
                                <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0087"/>products as the only cheery
                            note in an otherwise not very encouraging picture of the agricultural
                            scene. In response to the President's question, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the change in cotton
                            marketing practices would go into effect this year.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that the Treasury has certainly done an excellent
                            job to date. As far as the weapons we had against adversity, they seem
                            to boil down chiefly to a change in interest rate with the difficulties
                            that this might bring for the domestic economy and Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName>. The President remarked that we
                            seem to be faced with a screwy system, in which we had to squeeze
                            important public activities in the spheres of defense and aid in order
                            to let the private activities of tourism and foreign investment go
                            forward untouched. However, that was how life was, and how the system
                            operated.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> observed that it
                            was important for us to organize a promotional campaign for Americans to
                            see America first, and for more foreign travel in the United States.
                            There was then an exchange between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> on the relative merits of restricting tourist
                            expenditures and the flow of investment capital. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought the former an undesirable
                            and regressive policy which no Democratic administration should
                            undertake. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            considered that restriction of tourism, especially by taxes, would be
                            much less a blow to confidence and therefore much more desirable than
                            restrictions on the sale of foreign securities.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that the Treasury was very skillful in shooting
                            down, every three months or so, the balloons which other departments had
                            floated. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                            observed that this reflected the Treasury's realism, its understanding
                            that there were no panaceas and its cool assessment of the facts. As for
                            the reductions in defense expenditures which must form the major part of
                            our forward program, he considered that selling the Europeans on it
                            would not be difficult.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what else we had beyond the reductions in defense and
                            aid expenditures abroad and the possibility of raising interest rates
                            later in the year. What about a tax on the use of capital markets by
                            foreigners? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>
                            indicated that the Treasury was exploring this possibility but was
                            encountering many difficult technical problems. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that a tax did not have the
                            selectivity of the kind of control system which Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had proposed. In his judgment, if
                            we do anything to restrict foreign securities sales, controls are better
                            than taxes. He added a last word on the need for a citizens committee to
                            promote foreign investment in the United States and said that he would
                            send a proposal along to the President on this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> spoke of the need
                            for being tough abroad and for pushing in a number of areas including
                            more competitive agricultural prices, the reduction of petroleum
                            imports, a general export drive, providing <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62"
                                facs="0088"/>tax advantages to importers, an examination of what
                            could be done to implement a revised Webb-Pomerene Act,<note n="5"

                            response to the President's request, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> promised a memorandum on this

                                Cabinet Committee to conduct the studies it recommended in its April
                                6 report (see <ref target="#d23">Document 23</ref>), particularly
                                those that would lead to increased U.S. exports and decreased
                                imports. He suggested that these studies might cover ocean shipping
                                rates, agricultural support policy, petroleum policy, rapid
                                depreciation based on export sales, and anti-trust legislation.

                        </list>
                        <p>My purpose is to inform you of certain planned redeployments of Army and
                            Air Force units from Europe. These redeployments have been programmed
                            for some time and, hence, are distinct from the balance of payments
                            actions I will recommend to you by 1 July 63. However, the projected
                            balance of payments savings resulting from these redeployments will be
                            reflected therein.</p>
                        <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0091"/>
                        <p>During the Berlin crisis the Army's strength in Europe increased from
                            228,700 to 273,400. During <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63 we
                            reduced this peak figure to 256,000. During <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> ‘64 we are programming a further reduction to 240,000,
                            though in view of your forthcoming trip Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and I have agreed that we should
                            limit withdrawals in the first quarter of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> ‘64 to the non-combat troops only (9,700).</p>
                        <p>In the case of the Air Force in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Europe, Air Force strength increased from 21 to 32 tactical fighter
                            squadrons during the Berlin crisis, including a number of Air National
                            Guard squadrons. Because the immediate return of all the additional
                            squadrons would have caused an unnecessarily sharp reduction, we
                            activated the 366th Wing of four Regular Air Force squadrons using ANG
                            F-84 aircraft and equipment. We also planned to deploy three additional
                            squadrons to obtain a total of 28 squadrons. Subsequently, the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommended and I approved the
                            retention of the additional squadrons in the CONUS and the earmarking of
                            Strike Command squadrons for rapid deployment to Europe for possible air
                            superiority operations in the Berlin Air Corridors.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the 366th Wing, we find that is of marginal value. The
                            obsolescent equipment, lack of war consumables and of modern ordnance
                            restrict the operational value of this wing. Based on August 62 and
                            April 63 recommendations of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> I
                            approved in April the return of the wing to the CONUS in the first
                            quarter, <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> ‘64, for conversion to modern
                            F-4C aircraft and directed that the four bases in France be kept as
                            dispersed operating bases. We then notified the appropriate Congressmen
                            and the press of this move.</p>
                        <p>As for the political implications of these actions, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and I believe that the chief
                            concern is the danger of giving to the Europeans any basis for suspicion
                            that these actions somehow are part of a larger pattern and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> is right in his
                            claim that the U.S. will pull out of Europe.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that we cannot afford to take any steps which would cause
                            apprehension in Europe of a U.S. withdrawal. We believe, however, that
                            the nature of these actions is such as to incur little risk of
                            stimulating European fears. The withdrawal of the F-84 Wing and the
                            reduction of Army non-combat troops represent the next-to-last
                            installment of the gradual phase-out of the Berlin build-up which has
                            been in progress since the summer of 1962. The last installment, the
                            decision for withdrawal of which has been deferred until after your trip
                            to Europe, consists of ground combat troops (one armored cavalry
                            regiment, two medium tank battalions and three artillery battalions).
                            Yet, even with their return, as we noted above, the Army in Europe will
                            still be above its pre-Berlin crisis strength and its capabilities have
                            been greatly increased through modernization, reorganization, and
                            prepositioning equipment. Careful and objective exploitation of these
                            favorable elements will permit <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0092"/>us
                            to minimize the danger of untoward political developments and Secretary

                            efforts to this end.</p>
                        <p>As you know, other redeployments are currently under study pursuant to
                            your directive of April 20 to the Cabinet Committee on Balance of

                                    reductions would raise the fear among Europeans that more cuts
                                    would follow, as a part of a pattern of US withdrawal from
                                    Europe. DeGaulle's hand would be strengthened. As a result, the
                                    immense American political influence over a delicate and vitally
                                    important complex, which it has been possible for us to exercise
                                    largely because of our major troop presence in Europe, would be
                                    weakened.</item>
                                <item>Second, I am not persuaded that it would be wise to alleviate
                                    our balance of payments problem through troop withdrawals,
                                    certainly not before all other avenues for easing the problem
                                    have been exhausted.</item>
                                <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0093"/>
                                <item>Third, a major withdrawal would force us to accept what is
                                    essentially a nuclear trip-wire posture in Europe since our
                                    involvement in two world wars in the last half century
                                    demonstrates that in a world-wide crisis complete disassociation
                                    from Europe is entirely infeasible. Allied progress toward a
                                    balanced strategy and force structure in Europe would stop and
                                    instead the Europeans would probably cut back their own
                                    non-nuclear forces. Although I share your concern that the US
                                    7th Army, fully equipped and trained to fight, has very weak
                                    allied forces on both flanks, I believe we must first assure
                                    ourselves that further strengthening of these flanks cannot be
                                    realized before we seek other solutions. To do otherwise would
                                    involve our accepting a dangerously lowered nuclear threshold,
                                    with higher risks of political collapse or nuclear war. Berlin,
                                    especially, would become more hazardous.</item>
                                <item>Fourth, US force deployments in Central Europe have
                                    contributed immensely to the creation of a military environment
                                    conducive to the development and maintenance of German political
                                    and military stability. Particularly with the transfer of
                                    government about to take place in Germany, we cannot risk the
                                    reduction in our influence over German affairs which would
                                    result from a major withdrawal of US forces.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Finally, it seems to me that no substantial withdrawal should be carried
                            out or even planned before completion of the new <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning exercise aimed at mutually
                            relating the strategy, the forces, and the budg-ets within the Alliance.
                            In the wake of a series of major US actions affecting European security,
                            taken without what Europeans regard as adequate consultation, a
                            unilateral change in our forces in Europe could be disastrous to the
                            cohesion of the Alliance.</p>
                        <p>While, as I said, I do not rule out limited force readjustments for
                            logistical streamlining or other technical reasons, any readjustment
                            must be carefully handled if we are to avoid serious political damage.
                            Therefore, I would hope there can be full participation from the outset
                            by us in any discussions of proposed change in existing US military
                            deployment in Europe.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion with the President, it might be useful to broaden the
                            participation to include other members of the Cabinet or the <gloss

                            </table></p>
                        <p>These estimates are based on the currently planned deployment of our
                            military forces and the continuation of all current Department of
                            Defense programs designed to reduce expenditures overseas. They also
                            reflect a moderate increase in price and wage levels overseas
                            anticipated for this time period.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I have made a concerted effort during the past two years to
                            reduce the net adverse balance of Department of Defense transactions
                            entering the international balance of payments. During the period <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1961-63, the net Department of Defense
                            adverse balance, i.e., gross expenditures overseas less receipts, was
                            reduced by approximately $850 million—from $2,334 million to $1,477
                            million. This reduction was achieved by holding our expenditures
                            relatively constant despite increased <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69"
                                facs="0095"/>international tension and inflation abroad, and by
                            increasing receipts.</p>
                        <p>With respect to these greater receipts, Germany and Italy have agreed to
                            offset all or part of our defense expenditures in these countries by
                            increased spending for U.S. military goods and services. Our efforts to
                            increase sales of U.S. military equipment to other allied countries will
                            continue to be pressed. However, we believe that the $1 billion of
                            annual receipts projected for the period <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964-66 are a realistic maximum.</p>

                        <p>Although the redeployments of Air Force units reduce our forward deployed
                            forces, they would have a desirable effect on our capabilities to

                            Japanese our belief that Japan must depend more on its own self-defense
                            capabilities in the future. In this connection I have been disappointed
                            by the current level of Japan's defense expenditures.</p>
                        <p>I believe the minor adjustments of Army strength in Europe are desirable,
                            gold flow considerations notwithstanding, in the interests of better
                            organization and management of our resources. This applies particularly
                            to the reorganization and streamlining of the Army Line of
                            Communications (LOC) in France. However, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            state: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"The reduction in the Army LOC in Europe could have an adverse
                                    impact on the Army combat capability. Three areas of principal
                                    concern are the ability of the Army to respond quickly to an
                                    emergency in Europe after the cuts are made, the concentration
                                    of stocks in the forward area, and the extremely important
                                    politico-military implications of placing a part of the LOC in
                                    Western France on standby and reducing war reserve levels to 90
                                    days. I believe this adverse impact can be minimized by
                                    cooperative logistics agreements in the form of joint depot
                                    utilization in Western France, by maintaining a capability in
                                    CONUS and Europe for rapid expansion in an emergency and by
                                    insuring that adequate airlift and sealift are available for a

                        <p>The possible termination of the Caribou program in Canada has been under
                            review for some time. The <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963
                            procurement was undertaken in part to retain the option of using that
                            aircraft if no more desirable alternative developed in the future while
                            at the same time permitting some continued improvement in Army
                            capability. Continuing study of this matter has led to the conclusion
                            that the 157 Caribou on hand and on order as of June 30, 1963 will be
                            adequate to meet our requirements in view of the availability of
                            C-130E's.</p>
                        <p>During your meeting with Prime Minister Pearson on 10-11 May 1963, you
                            indicated that we were then reviewing our requirement for the Caribou.
                            You will, of course, remember that we are committed to consult with the
                            Canadian Government before any termination notice is announced. When I
                            met on June 6 with Mr. Drury, the Canadian Minister of Defense
                            Production, I told him that Caribou would have to compete on its own
                            merits against other alternative solutions to the Army's air transport
                            problem. Thus, termination of Caribou procurement will not surprise the
                            Canadian Government even though it will undoubtedly be
                            disappointing.</p>
                        <p>I have consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff with regard to the
                            military acceptability of the foregoing measures. While recognizing the
                            compelling economic issues inherent in the current balance of payments
                            problem, they point out that “most of the measures designed to control
                            gold outflow work against the military desideratum of maintaining a <pb
                                n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0098"/>forward strategic posture based
                            upon the deployment of substantial military forces in sensitive
                            strategic areas overseas. The actions recommended in this memorandum
                            which entail bringing home Air Force units will, in varying degrees,
                            increase the reaction time of our military response, particularly in the
                            areas of the Western Pacific. The proposed reduction in the B-47 forces
                            overseas [a reduction of 23 aircraft for a period of a few months]<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d28fn5">Brackets in the source text.</note> will
                            occasion a readjustment of strategic nuclear targeting and, for a
                            limited time, will reduce the weight of our nuclear attack. Also, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff have expressed concern over the effect on base
                            rights in Iceland, Spain, and Japan of a reduction of U.S. garrisons
                            there unless such reductions are preceded by careful bilateral
                            negotiations. However, if the contribution of these actions to the
                            solution of the balance of payments problem is considered to outweigh
                            the military risk involved, then the Joint Chiefs of Staff accept the
                            proposals.”</p>

                                Actions</hi></p>
                        <p>In arriving at these recommendations I have considered a number of other
                            alternatives. These actions included possible redeployments of
                            additional U.S. forces now in Europe and the Pacific, changes in
                            depend-ents policies, early termination of the SAC Reflex posture in
                            Europe, and a further reduction in overseas petroleum procurement. In
                            the course of preliminary discussions, the Department of State expressed
                            concern over the possible adverse political and economic repercussions
                            of substantial redeployments or a significant curtailment of petroleum
                            procurement overseas.</p>
                        <p>To cite one example of these political constraints, we estimated earlier
                            this year that approximately $20 million of our <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964 requirement for aviation gasoline normally procured
                            in the Caribbean area could have been returned to the U.S. by
                            restricting bids to U.S. sources. The added cost of this action would
                            have been only $322,000. When weighed against the fact that other
                            procurements for use overseas are being returned to the U.S. at premium
                            differentials up to 50%, this proposal was very attractive from the
                            budgetary standpoint, and was militarily sound. However, in view of the
                            State Department objections, the procurement of the first half of our
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 requirement was not
                            restricted to U.S. sources.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the actions recommended herein, I am investigating the
                            following areas which may result in additional savings over those now

                        <p>On July 18, 1963, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> sent a special message to Congress on the
                            balance of payments. The President cited the improvement in
                            balance-of-payments deficit and other signs of progress. He believed
                            that further administrative and legislative measures were required,
                            however, to make “inroads into the hard core of our continuing payments
                            deficit,” and he especially reemphasized “the necessity of improving
                            this Nation's over-all long-range economic performance—including
                            increased investment and modernization for greater productivity and
                            profits, continued cost and price stability and full employment and
                            faster growth.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> then expounded
                            on immediate measures to reduce the deficit and to defend the U.S. gold
                            reserves in the following areas: export expansion, tourism, federal
                            expenditures abroad, and short- and long-term capital flows. Concerning
                            the latter, he urged Congress to enact an “Interest Equalization Tax”
                            that would increase the cost of borrowing to foreigners. Immediate
                            measures in other areas proposed by the President included investment by
                            foreign savers in the securities of U.S. private companies, special
                            government transactions (such as prepayment of debt by foreign countries
                            and advance payments on military purchases), gold sales and increased
                            dollar holdings, a standby arrangement to draw on dollars in the
                            International Monetary Fund, and informal credit arrangements with the
                            central banks of industrialized nations.</p>
                        <p>Full implementation of his proposed program of action, the President
                            concluded, would realize gains of about $2 billion, which “will give us
                            the time our basic long-term program needs to improve our international
                            competitive position, and increase the attention for investment in the
                            United States.”</p>

                                as I measure matters, of how to handle the problem. There is at
                                present no mechanism for enforcing the continuing action on the wide
                                front that the problem requires. Since I must speak frankly about
                                persons and departments, I plead that this particular memorandum be
                                held in strict confidence.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The heart of the matter is that for everyone concerned with the
                                balance of payments problem it is subordinate to another concern.
                                For the Council of Economic Advisers, it is subordinate to the
                                domestic economy. Tobin, although his views were not typical, was
                                perilously close to the conclusion that there is no problem at all.
                                Other members, in fighting off measures which were considered, in my
                                view quite correctly, to have a bad domestic impact, failed to
                                develop a solidly affirmative position. All economists unduly
                                emphasize international liquidity, which is a fashionable
                                conversation piece of the economists' union. The State Department,
                                though it suffers from the effect of a weak balance of payments
                                position on its bargaining position, is primarily concerned with
                                protecting trade, troops and aid. The Commerce Department views the
                                trade balance largely as an opportunity to get more money for trade
                                promotion and foreign tourist travel. These are negligible in their
                                possibilities. The Treasury has responsibility for the problem as a
                                whole, but until recently its sacred cow has been the capital
                                market. Even now, the checking of long-term capital outflows, and
                                the stopping of avenues of escape around the proposed tax, is being
                                handled in a highly unwilling way.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The picture is not entirely black. Bob McNamara has made a loyal and
                            substantial effort to ease the problem. On the dollar-saving side, his
                            is the only area of substantial achievement.</p>
                        <p>Now as to remedies. Something over a year ago I urged you to set up a
                            Cabinet Committee to have jurisdiction over this problem and to be
                            responsible for its solution.<note n="2" xml:id="d30fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> This hasn't worked. It has been a place where
                            those responsible have sought to shift the buck. There is no further
                            hope for action here.</p>
                        <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>I gather you have been sufficiently pressed as regards the Treasury and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>. The Treasury hasn't
                            done well. It waited too long on long-term capital movements. It is
                            subject to the banker syndrome, which is to foresee disaster but prefer
                            inaction. However, the Treasury cannot exercise real jurisdiction over
                            the other Government Departments. The latter will always find it easier
                            to organize against <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> than
                            to follow his lead. An appeal to you is inherent in the situation, so
                            the problem comes to your office in any case.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I see no alternative to better organization of the Executive
                            Office for continuing pressure and action. This means, I believe, that
                            you must have someone of stature, fully seized of the seriousness of the
                            problem, who will do in this critical matter what Bundy does for you on
                            foreign policy and Sorensen on domestic policy. (You might reflect that
                            nothing in the areas they so competently now cover is as important as
                            the balance of payments, yet neither can function with real confidence
                            on this issue.) Such a solution will cause sadness in the Treasury and
                            the Council of Economic Advisers. But every President since Roosevelt
                            has had to have an economist or economic figure who was his man to help
                            him in combatting the excessive parochialism of departmental policy.
                            (Currie served Roosevelt in this way, <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">David
                                Bell</persName> so served Truman, and Randall and Gabriel Hauge so
                            served <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.) The man is
                            all-important. <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Carl Kaysen</persName>, who is
                            perhaps the ablest all-around economist in the country, is unfortunately
                            susceptible to the economists' union. As a result, he is overly
                            impressed by the international liquidity escapism. In any case, you need
                            someone full time. I suggest that, whatever the implications, you attach
                                <persName>Charles Hitch</persName> to the White House Office for
                            nine months for this job. He is highly intelligent, has a pragmatic view
                            of the issue, takes it seriously, and you can rely completely on his
                            judgment. He would act largely through you, but he would command respect
                            as your adviser. This need not be a permanent assignment. He need stay
                            only until the present bleeding is decisively reversed.</p>
                        <p>As I argue in the accompanying memorandum, the present trend can be
                            reversed. It is this, as well as the urgency of doing so, that leads me

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am submitting herewith
                            the report on the balance of payments which you requested.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d31fn1"><ref target="#d32">Document 32</ref>. The
                                President's request has not been further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>While I realize you are not without reading material, I venture to urge
                            your attention for the document as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The report takes an unsanguine view of the prospect. There is no solid
                            reason for expecting the situation to improve. The consequences of
                            unabated drain, which unhappily must be assumed, will be manifold and
                            grave.</p>
                        <p>In the report, I examine at some length the nature and shortcomings of
                            past action. By its nature this involves a good deal of second-guessing
                            and hindsight. I would hope this would not be thought critical of
                            individuals. It is important to see why, through errors of optimism and
                            the desire to contract out of difficult action, we have erred in
                            handling this problem in the past.</p>
                        <p>The heart of the strategy I propose is to suspend capital exports for a
                            minimum period of six to nine months, with possible extension. This is
                            imperative and requires supplementing recent Treasury action by stronger
                            executive measures. The existing steps are not sufficient for the
                            task.</p>
                        <p>The present course of trade negotiation is sadly inconsistent with our
                            balance of payments position. I recommend as the next step the effective
                            postponement of the existing negotiations with the Common Market
                            Countries. I would personally like to go much farther for I do not
                            believe that we have sufficiently reconciled our trade policy with our
                            balance of payments position. However, I am restrained by the lack of
                            public or even governmental preparation for such a reversal.</p>
                        <p>Further, I urge certain steps on tourist travel, military deployment, and
                            the deeper tying of aid. None of these, the military proposals excepted,
                            will have a very prompt yield. All will be important in the slightly
                            longer run.</p>
                        <p>The person who comments responsibly on the payments problem is like the
                            herald who brings bad news: He is a figure for popular execution, and in
                            this case each department will have its own gibbet. There are, indeed,
                            grave difficulties with everything here urged. I hope these will not be
                            considered decisive for they must now be measured against the
                            alternative <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0104"/>courses of action,
                            which are few and worse, and the consequences of inaction, which would
                            be worse yet.</p>

                        <p rend="center">THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS</p>
                        <p>I have now reviewed the papers on the balance of payments<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d32fn1">Not further identified.</note> and have talked at
                            some length with those principally concerned. The following assessment
                            is divided into three parts: the problem; the past and present efforts
                            to deal with it which I feel to be seriously defective; and the action
                            we should now take. We are, I fear, faced with the need for serious and
                            difficult steps more than a little occasioned by the reluctance and
                            postponement of the past. Those who now urge further postponement may
                            wish to recall that the steps we now face could have been avoided by
                            lesser but more timely action in the past. Further delay will mean yet
                            more severe measures.</p>
                        <p>Delay will mean continued accumulation in foreign hands of dollar assets
                            convertible into gold or the conversion of these assets into gold. Gold
                            withdrawals at any time during the next 14 months could occur with
                            damaging political effect on the Administration. It might be promoted
                            for political purposes. We are taking unacceptable risks as long as the
                            imbalance continues. There are more deep-seated costs. You have heard
                            sufficiently of the restraints that the payments weakness imposes on
                            domestic employment policy. It is also notably undermining our foreign
                                <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0105"/>policy. Bargaining strength
                            is far more intimately related to the balance of payments than to any
                            other factor. Our troubles this past year with our European allies,
                            France in particular, are not because we are militarily weaker or have
                            less eloquent negotiators than in the past. It is because we are
                            financially weak and our allies have become strong and more than a
                            trifle arrogant as a result. If the weakness continues we will be able
                            to keep our military and economic aid commitments only by borrowing. In
                            consequence we will have the economic and political weakness of a debtor
                            nation. It will soon be noticed that our foreign policy lacks the power,
                            certainty and confidence of the past. This will also have domestic
                            political overtones, for the weakness will be attributed one way or
                            another to the Administration.</p>
                        <p>There is a feeling among some in the Administration that if the worst
                            came to the ultimate worst these various consequences could be
                            eliminated by devaluation. (Dr. Tobin has influentially taken this
                            position.) So, though it cannot be mentioned, we have an ace in the
                            hole. We have not. Prior to any decision to devalue in our system of
                            checks, news leaks and balances there would be vast press disturbance,
                            huge gold outflows, and deep suspicion of the competence of those
                            concerned, all with the most disastrous political effects. And
                            economists, even the men of reputation, persist in thinking of
                            devaluation (or floating exchange rates) in terms of a small country
                            vis-a-vis the United States. In fact, the devaluation by the United
                            States would bring prompt and immediate devaluation by every other
                            country, including currencies as hard as the Swiss Franc. All this would
                            promptly restore the previous exchange and trading relationships, the
                            previous imbalance, and the previous dependence on external credits.</p>
                        <p>In turning to measures, we must see first (a) why past action has not
                            worked and (b) what prospective action is needed. For purposes not of
                            criticism but of analysis, it is especially important that we see the
                            defects of past action.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Shortcomings of Past Action</p>
                        <p>Much useful work has been done on the balance of payments problem. Both
                            the underlying problem and the possible course of action have been
                            considerably clarified in the last two and one-half years. However, our
                            attitude toward the problem has been seriously defective for the
                            following reasons: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We have naturally sought to maintain confidence in the dollar.
                                    Accordingly, we have been perpetually optimistic about the
                                    prospects for turning the balance in our favor. In the course of
                                    persuading others, we have repeatedly persuaded ourselves that
                                    all would soon be well. Each remedial step—to tie aid, reduce
                                    dollar outlays for defense, stimulate trade and tourist travel,
                                    and (more recently) to control access to the domestic <pb n="80"
                                        xml:id="pg_80" facs="0106"/>capital market—has been
                                    presented as a total remedy. This optimism has then become the
                                    basis of policy until it was evident that something more was
                                    needed. There have been so many optimistic forecasts that none
                                    would now be taken seriously. This is not good public
                                    procedure.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We have attached great hopes to policies that were never
                                    capable of supplying a solution. And we have seized with
                                    inordinate enthusiasm on any available trend in the right
                                    direction. There was no chance whatever that increased foreign
                                    travel in the United States would have an important effect on
                                    the travel account or that Government-sponsored trade promotion
                                    activities abroad would importantly affect sales within the
                                    lifetime of this Administration. These steps may be useful but
                                    the changes they work can only be exceedingly gradual. Recently
                                    it has become the cliche, supported by the Brookings study,<note
                                        n="2" xml:id="d32fn2">Not further identified.</note> that
                                    European prices are rising more rapidly than our own. This will
                                    be the fundamental corrective. This is unduly optimistic. One of
                                    the prime accomplishments of this Administration has been to
                                    obtain a measure of control over wages and prices. But there is
                                    no real indication that our control is better than that of our
                                    European competitors. At any time our prices could go up. And it
                                    seems certain that the Common Market governments can bring
                                    theirs under greater control if they must. At this moment, in
                                    fact, there are indications of adverse movements on our side.
                                    Accordingly, it is silly and dangerous to pin our policy, as we
                                    are now doing, to so slight a prospect.</item>

                                <item>The balance of payments has fallen afoul of the interests and
                                    concerns of individual Departments. The Council of Economic
                                    Advisers, in my view quite properly, have considered the balance
                                    of payments subordinate to the performance of the domestic
                                    economy. The State Department has considered it subordinate to
                                    troop strength, trade, and aid. The Treasury Department has
                                    until recently considered it subordinate to the maintenance of
                                    free capital markets. If all of these interests are protected (I

                                <item>The liquidity problem has been used as an escape hatch by the
                                    economists. International reserves are unquestionably
                                    inadequate. As we make our balance of payments better, that of
                                    others will become worse. But more international reserves are
                                    not a basic remedy; they only extend the time we have to correct
                                    our imbalance. Moreover, as responsibility is now assumed in the
                                    world, the negotiation of improved reserve mechanism is only
                                    possible when the United States is acting out of generosity and
                                    not out of need. The European countries do not see their

                                <item>Finally, in dealing with this problem we have had an erroneous
                                    view of the national interest. It has been said that trade, aid,
                                    and military outlays must not be touched because this would
                                    jeopardize the fundamental security of the United States. We
                                    have yet to realize how much the payments balance is already
                                    jeopardizing our position. A weak balance of payments is
                                    undermining our role as the leader of the Western Alliance,
                                    making it safe for difficult politicians to thumb their nose at
                                    us, weakening our hand on trade negotiation, and making us
                                    petitioners on currency matters. This is what is fragmenting the
                                    Alliance; by not needing to stick with us each can go off in his
                                    own direction. The Alliance would be in far better shape with
                                    fewer American troops and a strong American payments balance
                                    than a large American soldiery in Europe for which we have to
                                    beg from the French or the Germans.</item>

                                    must be considered and real. Anything that now smacks of toying
                                    with the problem will be damaging to confidence. Nor can we
                                    afford to waste more time.</item>

                                    henceforth will hurt. All untaken action will interfere with
                                    some existing policy. Otherwise the action would have been
                                    taken.</item>

                                <item>We should bear in mind that determined action in this field
                                    may bring far quicker response than we imagine. Germany, France
                                    and Italy got out of a seemingly hopeless balance of payments
                                    position with amazing speed. Britain has been in trouble at
                                    least five times since World War II; each time when she has
                                    cranked herself up to determined action (which as with us was
                                    what required the effort), the situation was quickly remedied.
                                    The Canadians were in bad shape a year ago; a strong move
                                    brought quick results. It should be the same, given serious
                                    action, with us. This point is important because strong surgical
                                    action may do less damage to military, trade, aid, and other
                                    important things, including our domestic political situation,
                                    than the continuing erosion of half-hearted measures that are
                                    not really corrective.</item>

                        <p rend="center">Long-Term Capital Movements</p>
                        <p>Control of long-term capital outflows is the first essential in a balance
                            of payments strategy.</p>
                        <p>It is the least damaging attack on the balance of payments. It means that
                            savings which hitherto have been flowing into foreign investment will
                            now seek domestic use. This will keep our long-term interest rates low,
                            with supporting effect on domestic economy and employment. It has some
                            differential effect on our productivity. Since other countries,
                            including Switzerland, maintain full convertibility while keeping formal
                            or informal restraint on long-term capital movements, there should be no
                            serious loss of international confidence from this moratorium.</p>
                        <p>The way has now been paved for control by the interest equalization tax
                            and the attendant uncertainty which has brought long-term capital
                            outflow to a temporary halt. However, it is not at all certain that at
                            present rates the levy will be an effective deterrent. Either passage or
                            non-passage of the legislation could bring a renewed outflow. Nor does
                            the levy touch direct investment. We should have a six-months'
                            moratorium on both. Long-term capital movements are a withdrawal of
                            available surplus; this surplus by definition we do not have.
                            Accordingly, I would urge that even after the passage of the tax (or its
                            rejection) the market be kept closed for at least nine months. The
                            portfolio and issues market could be closed to specifically foreign
                            borrowers under Section 5 (b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.
                            Steps should also be taken to see that there is no evasion by way of
                            long-term bank loans. By (say) next July we might have another look to
                            see what relaxation we could afford, subject to the restraining effect
                            of the tax.</p>
                        <p>Immediately, the 500 largest American corporations plus any others
                            indicated as operating abroad should be circularized by the Treasury
                            with the request that they (a) defer any new direct investment abroad
                            and (b) notify the Treasury of present commitments. If this does not
                            work, stronger steps should be taken under existing law as above. Direct
                            investment is a large item in the Western European countries and if
                            savings are to be appreciable it must be included. Without hurting
                            Canada or the Underdeveloped Countries, for which there would be
                            exceptions, a half to three quarters of a billion (net) of last year's
                            $2.2 billion deficit could have been covered by suspension of long-term
                            outflow. For this year there would have been a proportionately rather
                            larger saving out of the larger deficit.</p>
                        <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0109"/>
                        <p rend="center">Trade</p>
                        <p>While it is official doctrine in Washington that the trade balance is
                            moving in our favor, in fact the prospect is unfavorable. We have had no
                            gains in the last three years; the merchandise balance has in fact
                            fallen from $5.4 billion in 1961 to $4.1 billion in the first quarter of
                            this year. This is a surplus, as the papers on the subject stress ad
                            nauseum. But our past position has only been strong because this balance
                            on commerical account was relatively much more favorable than now. As
                            noted, this is no reliable assurance that our wage-price situation will
                            continue more to our advantage than that of our European competitors.
                            There is the absolute certainty as things now stand of adverse movements
                            in our tariff position.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, under the Treaty of Rome it is the unweighted average of
                            tariffs that is being lowered around the Community. This means that we
                            will get tariff reductions in those markets to which we do not now ship
                            goods; we will get tariff increases in our established markets. Since it
                            takes time to develop imports, the damage will considerably exceed the
                            benefit. Meanwhile, the elimination of internal tariffs means that
                            American machinery and equipment and other manufactured products will be
                            subject to the increased competition of tariff-free products from other
                            countries within the Common Market. This adds up in the years ahead to
                            an adverse movement of some magnitude.</p>
                        <p>Reaction to this matter so far has combined hope with incantation. The
                            papers say the adverse movement must be offset by muscular and masculine
                            bargaining during the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            round. This is self-delusion. Tariffs are in fact being raised against
                            us. We can get them back down only by equal concessions on our side. Our
                            payments balance weakens our hand on tariff bargaining as elsewhere. So
                            present trends will leave us at a real disadvantage. But it is worse
                            than that. We shall be reducing tariffs primarily on European consumers
                            goods which are responsive both to lower prices and high incomes in this
                            market. We shall be offering concessions at least in considerable part
                            on machinery and equipment which, in the view of qualified observers,
                            are procured in the United States less because of their price advantage
                            than because of their technological superiority. In any case, we do know
                            that consumers goods are generally more responsive to tariffs and price
                            reductions than capital goods.</p>
                        <p>The hard truth is that traditional trade policy is now at odds with the
                            balance of payments problem and no semantic obfuscation can cancel the
                            fact. We should not be surprised. The existing policy was born in
                            reaction to the incongruity of high tariffs in a creditor which had no
                            unilateral transfers abroad. It accommodated the need of foreign
                            countries to make large payments to the United States. The policy
                            remains; the situation <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0110"/>has been
                            reversed. If we are going ahead with the Kennedy round we must expect it
                            to worsen the payments balance.</p>
                        <p>We have come very far down a very dubious path. The historic method of
                            correcting a payments balance has been to raise tariffs and raise
                            domestic prices. It is probably the best method of accomplishing the
                            result—and one that is most consistent with a free price system and
                            minimum controls. Present policy is to go in exactly the opposite
                            direction. We are planning action that makes our balance of payments
                            action more perilous. There are also interesting questions of priority.
                            Are we to expand our imports of luxury automobiles, fine woolens, and
                            other expensive European products at the same time as we limit travel
                            freedom or redeploy troops?</p>
                        <p>The issue is eased by the time-consuming character of the negotiations.
                            It will be some months before they begin and a considerable period
                            thereafter before there are any cuts. This quiet but calculated delay
                            can hold off adverse effects for some time. This I recommend as a
                            minimum. It would limit the damage by unveiling a tariff round that must
                            weaken us beyond what is inherent in the forming of the Common
                            Market.</p>
                        <p>There is a strong case for suggesting that we should go in the opposite
                            direction. Tariffs are being raised against us in Europe. We need to cut
                            back on imports of consumer products. The logic of this situation is an
                            offsetting surcharge on manufactured products from the Common Market
                            Countries as the best way of getting our balance of payments turned
                            around. Even from the viewpoint of the proponent of liberal trade, this
                            might be the best way of righting our position promptly and with minimum
                            damage. The long erosion of lesser measures could be worse. There would,
                            presumably, be some retaliation by the Common Market Countries. But our
                            farm exports to the Common Market Countries, grain especially, are on a
                            residual basis and retribution would hurt the exporter. Machinery and
                            equipment exports are related to the technological situation and
                            retribution here would also hurt the buyer. However, a step of this kind
                            is probably beyond the range of present attitudes. The psychological
                            turn-around would be very great.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Defense Outlays Abroad</p>
                        <p>I am impressed by the efforts that the Defense Department has made to cut
                            its expenditures abroad. I am persuaded that no further efforts should
                            be made in this direction which seem to discriminate against military
                            personnel. Limitation on travel by dependents and limitation on personal
                            expenditures by the military abroad, particularly so long as nothing is
                            done about expenditures of tourists and wealthy American residents
                            abroad, is palpably discriminatory.</p>
                        <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0111"/>
                        <p>I would urge, however, that continuing and forceful attention be given to
                            a more modern deployment of troops. It is much more important to our
                            position to have a strong balance of payments than to have any given
                            number of divisions in Europe. Modern airlift capacity gives us a choice
                            which we did not have 10 years ago as to whether troops are stationed in
                            forward positions in Europe or in the zone of the interior of the United
                            States. We should increasingly exercise the option in behalf of
                            stateside locations. This is not withdrawal or redeployment; rather it
                            is an accommodation to the mobility of the modern force. Long-range
                            combat aircraft are providing much the same opportunities for the Air
                            Force. Our terminology should reflect this fact. The semantics are
                            important. We should speak not of redeployment but of (say)
                            multiple-base operations. Gains from this source will take time to
                            realize but are obviously important.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Tourist Travel</p>
                        <p>Much attention has been paid in recent discussion to the increasing
                            outlays for travel from $1.0 billion in 1954 to twice that amount this
                            year, with another $400 million on foreign flag carriers. There is no
                            chance of appreciable offset from foreign travel in the United
                            States—American expenditure increases $100,000,000 a year, while foreign
                            expenditure goes up $35,000,000. Nor is there relief from the Travel
                            America program. Both are useful but have their principal quantitative
                            effect on the volume of wishful thinking.</p>
                        <p>To control tourist travel means to control the movement of people, with
                            attendant political and administrative difficulty and annoyance. A tax
                            on passports would be highly regressive. A per diem tax on days spent
                            abroad would have a particularly adverse effect on students, artists and
                            writers, who have the best of reasons for foreign residence. However, it
                            would be possible to have people declare expenditures abroad on their
                            income tax and subject outlays so declared to a surtax. This latter
                            would be little more subject to abuse than the deductions presently
                            allowed under the income tax. Control could be exercised in various
                            ways, including certified and attested exchanges of money. It would
                            exempt the low-income traveler—the person who spent less than say $750
                            abroad. It would reach the higher-spending traveler and would also be a
                            device for guiding traffic to American flag carriers were purchases of
                            tickets on such carriers excluded from the tax.</p>
                        <p>This would require new legislation. We should start work on the tax, but
                            defer a final decision until the beginning of the next legislative year.
                            The amounts involved are difficult to estimate. Perhaps we would do well
                            if we checked the present increase.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Deep Tying of Aid</p>
                        <p>As a last step, and one with longer run implications, we must begin to
                            extend aid-tying to include dollars which, in the absence of such
                            assist-ance, would have to be spent in the United States. There is
                            always danger of using aid for purchases that must come from the United
                            States market and free dollars earned in American trade somewhere else.
                            In the past, I have urged, unsuccessfully, that countries like India
                            agree as a quid pro quo to direct an increasing proportion of their free
                            dollar purchases to the United States. This proposal has run afoul of
                            the liberal trade-at-any-price policy. I am now inclined to think it
                            insufficient. Instead, we should move toward a policy of partial
                            financing. Both project and non-project assistance abroad would be
                            covered not 100% of dollar requirements but some specified percentage of
                            the total. The aid, though of an equal total, would be spread over a
                            large number of projects and purchases. Countries thus would have an
                            inducement to direct purchases now going to other countries to the
                            United Sates and to use dollars for this purpose. Our aid would thus
                            become a direct inducement to dollar trade; our aid, if you will,
                            becomes a massive but quite legitimate subsidy to our dollar trade.
                            Other developed countries that object have the option of effecting
                            similar arrangements. This would not bring any short-run change. It
                            would take the balance of payments problem out of the aid program in the
                            longer run. My judgment on this particular recommendation is not final,

                        <p>The foregoing program is not agreeable. But I would not judge there is
                            any part which I now propose that is insuperably difficult.</p>
                        <p>I would urge that we take a decision on four matters—the moratorium on
                            capital exports, the administrative delay on the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> round, the further military
                            program, and the deep tying of aid—at this time. The tourist expenditure
                            tax should be ready if the prospect still seems grim when Congress
                            assembles. We have time on this before the next travel season. The
                            temporary surcharge on imported consumers' goods is a drastic
                            turn-around in policy. I have an uneasy feeling that it will still be
                            necessary in the end, the consequences notwithstanding. Those who are
                            troubled by it should not go too far out on the limb for, by historical
                            standards, it is the most commonplace as well as the most certain of all
                            the remedies available.</p>

                                            reduction in procurement of foreign POL which would
                                            probably fall within the Caribbean, specifically on
                                            Venezuela. It will take full measure of our very best
                                            efforts to forestall the political instability, which
                                            typifies the Venezuelan problem, from turning into
                                            complete chaos. A reduction in revenues from US
                                            purchases of Venezuelan oil exports is bound to be
                                            highly destructive of the accomplishment of our
                                            objectives.</item>

                                        <item>Moreover, the magnitude of balance of payments savings
                                            which would be realized from effecting these decisive
                                            retractions in our military power, particularly in
                                            Europe and the Far East, would represent less than
                                            1/10th of the annual current gold and dollar deficit. In
                                            the case of Korea, for example, the military budget
                                            savings would be almost fully offset and the gold
                                            savings partly nullified by requirement for additional
                                            US foreign aid without which the Korean economy could
                                            not survive. In the context of sharply constricted aid
                                            appropriations this could become an acute crisis. Thus,
                                            in this as well as other areas the risks involved are
                                            out of all proportions to the prospective
                                            savings.</item>

                                    balance of payments problem which we currently confront, I would
                                    far rather accept the adverse foreign policy consequences of
                                    taking certain actions in the non-security, fiscal and monetary
                                    fields. These actions which have been previously studied by the
                                    Balance of Payments Committee would at least have the virtue of
                                    making a far more substantial dent in the existing problem.</p>
                                <p>Accordingly, I have instructed my staff to prepare detailed
                                    programs for pursuing our balance of payments savings operations
                                    in these areas, along with a time schedule for implementation. I
                                    would propose to provide this for your consideration within
                                    thirty days, as an alternative to acceptance of those portions
                                    of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposal which I have
                                    discussed in paragraph 4. above.</p>
                                <p>Also, though my preliminary review has cast doubt upon the
                                    utility of removing one of the two divisions from Korea, I would
                                    be prepared to join in a thorough State-Defense study of the
                                    advantages and disadvantages <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93"
                                        facs="0119"/>of taking such an action. Since the balance of
                                    payments savings to the US Government of removing our forces
                                    from Korea is likely to be relatively negligible (as noted
                                    previously) the delay occasioned by a careful examination of the
                                    security policy implications of a one division withdrawal would
                                    not adversely prejudice our efforts to rectify the balance of
                                    payments imbalance.</p></item>

                            1 and 2 ending with the word “capital”. Paragraphs 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d
                            were omitted entirely. Paragraph 3 was revised as follows: “The
                            Treasury, in consultation with the Council of Economic Advisers and the
                            Bureau of the Budget, to prepare tax proposals for possible presentation
                            to the next session of the Congress on a number of topics, including the
                            encouragement of increased exports. On increased exports, the Treasury
                            should consult with the Department of State and the Department of
                            Commerce.”</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 5 in the September 19 memorandum ended with the word
                            “earnings.” The second sentence of this paragraph in the President's <pb

                            memorandum for the record, and a ninth paragraph was added as follows:
                            “A more detailed record of the meeting and of my views is available in

                            International Balance of Payments, after taking account of the proposed
                            actions, is presented in Table 1. The current and proposed deployments
                            of U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft in Europe and the Pacific are shown
                            in Table 2.<note n="4" xml:id="d36fn4">For Tables 1 and 2, see the

                        <p>I do not believe the proposed force redeployments will weaken
                            significantly our ability to respond to Communist aggression. The
                            increase in the procurement of Army equipment, airlift aircraft, and
                            fighter aircraft, and the increase in the ferry range of such aircraft
                            have greatly increased our ability to deploy both air and ground forces
                            from the U.S. to theaters of operation within a period of strategic
                            warning.</p>
                        <p>In order to demonstrate the increased mobility of our forces, we expect
                            to conduct in October a strategic mobility exercise (”BIG LIFT”)
                            involving the deployment to Europe of an armored division and a
                            composite air strike force. The armored division and support unit
                            personnel will exercise with equipment already prepositioned in Europe
                            and participate in a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> sponsored
                            field training exercise. The exercise will serve to test our system and
                            to demonstrate dramatically our redeployment capabilities to our Allies
                            and to the Soviets. We would expect periodically to undertake similar
                            movements to the Far East. I anticipate <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97"
                                facs="0123"/>that by the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 65
                            we will be able to move over 200 combat-ready tactical fighters to
                            Europe in three days.</p>
                        <p>I have consulted the Joint Chiefs of Staff with regard to the military
                            acceptability of these measures. Their views are as follows:<note n="5"

                            Secretary of Defense's draft memorandum of September 19,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d37fn1"><ref target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note> but
                            with the exception of those items which were disapproved by the
                            Secretary of State, and with the restoration of $20 million in foreign
                            exchange petroleum costs which the Secretary of Defense undertook to
                            save in another area than that of Venezuela. The reductions approved
                            therefore total $190 million and include items 1, 2d, 5 and 6 in the
                            Secretary of Defense's memorandum.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Department of Defense would develop specific,
                            detailed, country proposals for these reductions and that they would be
                            submitted to the Department of State so that the timing and tactics of
                                <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0124"/>their implementation would be
                            carefully coordinated between the two Departments.</p>
                        <p>The President also indicated his desire that a political base be
                            established which would make it possible at some later stage to
                            reconsider the disapproved actions, and he particularly indicated his
                            desire to be in a position to approve actions 2a and 2c. He did not
                            indicate that he would expect to approve item 3 at any time in the near
                            future, but he agreed to further review of this matter.</p>
                        <p>Because of the sensitivity of this topic, only the most limited
                            distribution of this memorandum is being made in a single copy to each
                            officer present, but the Departments may use the first two paragraphs of
                            this record in communicating necessary information to others as to
                            present discussions.</p>
                        <p>Pending the development of a strong plan for the establishment of the
                            necessary political base, knowledge of the President's further desires
                            should not be communicated except on the most urgent need-to-know basis,
                            and in no case in writing.</p>

                                        ability to add rapidly additional forces to Europe. Were it
                                        a replacement division, it would use the equipment of one of
                                        the divisions now in place. Instead, it is using one of the
                                        two division sets of equipment prestocked in Europe. In
                                        reality, the US thus will have over seven divisions in

                            <item>Report on the Balance of Payments</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>At the time of the inauguration, the dollar was under heavy pressure as a
                            result of three successive years of heavy balance of payments deficits
                            and the heavy gold losses which occurred in the fall of 1960 and
                            continued during the first three weeks of 1961.</p>
                        <p>We were faced with two necessities, both serious, but one far more acute
                            than the other. The first and most acute necessity was to reestablish
                            confidence in the value of the dollar and thus put an end to the heavy
                            losses of gold. The second necessity was to devise a program that would
                            lead as rapidly as possible to the achievement of balance in our
                            payments. It was recognized from the beginning that this second
                            objective could only be achieved over a period of several years, but it
                            was also recognized that steady and observable progress was necessary if
                            confidence in the dollar was to be maintained.</p>
                        <p>We have had marked success in achieving our first objective, the
                            restoration and maintenance of confidence in the dollar. However, while
                            progress has been made toward our second objective, the achievement of
                            balance in our payments, it has not as yet been adequate, and more rapid
                            and sustained results are now necessary. Fortunately, there are
                            reasonable indications that programs presently underway can bring us the
                            improvement we need.</p>
                        <p>The restoration of confidence in the dollar involved convincing the world
                            of our determination to maintain the gold value of the dollar at $35 an
                            ounce, and to end our payments deficits. In providing protection for the
                            dollar we have created a whole series of new financial tools and
                            mechanisms, designed to offset speculative surges and conserve our gold
                            stock.</p>

                                    summer. I am attaching a fuller description of the Committee's

                        <p>We have had two programs to improve our balance of payments both
                            contained in Presidential Messages to the Congress, one in February
                            1961, and the second in July 1963.<note n="1" xml:id="d39fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d2">Documents 2</ref> and <ref target="#d29"
                                >29</ref>.</note> The February 1961 program involved stress on
                            export expansion, the creation of a new system of export insurance
                            comparable to those in use abroad, the establishment of strict
                            buy-American policies for our foreign aid program and our military
                            forces overseas, the shoring up of short-term interest rates to check
                            outflows of funds, and an attempt to moderate the outflow of direct
                            investment through the removal of tax incentives to investment overseas.
                            Our efforts in the tax field were only about 50 percent successful as
                            Congress refused to adopt our entire tax package. The investment credit
                            and the 1962 depreciation reform were also part of this program since
                            they were designed to improve our competitive position by speeding up
                            modernization of plant and equipment. They have been helpful in this
                            regard but tax incentives to new investment are still somewhat greater
                            overseas than in the United States.</p>
                        <p>By early 1963, it became obvious that the 1961 program was not adequate
                            and that further steps would have to be taken. Our hopes for increased
                            exports had not been realized, the Berlin augmentation of our military
                            forces in Europe had offset the savings made by Defense in their
                            Buy-American program, and Congress had only accepted half of our tax
                            program on direct foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, early last spring a study was undertaken of ways and means
                            of further reducing overseas government expenditures. The Treasury also
                            initiated studies of methods of restraining the outflow of <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0129"/>portfolio capital which had started to
                            reach alarming proportions. The result was the July message.</p>
                        <p>In this message, the President reiterated the importance of export
                            expansion, suggested a “See America Now” program for 1964 to make travel
                            at home a more appealing alternative to foreign travel, announced that
                            the United States had arranged a standby facility with the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> for up to one-half billion dollars,
                            announced that the rate of Federal overseas expenditures would be
                            reduced by $1 billion by the end of 1964, and proposed the Interest
                            Equalization Tax.<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">Additional documentation on
                                preparations for legislation for an Interest Equalization Tax is in

                                Treasury Department.</note> This tax is designed to increase the
                            cost to foreigners of raising money in our markets by 1 percent a year.
                            A new program to stimulate foreign purchases of U.S. securities was also
                            announced.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Federal Reserve raised the rediscount rate to 3-1/2 percent
                            from 3 percent. This action has brought our short-term interest rates
                            into approximate balance with those abroad and was the culmination of a
                            two-year joint Treasury-Federal Reserve effort to raise short-term
                            interest rates while maintaining the availability of credit and avoiding
                            upward pressure on the long-term rates that are so vital to domestic
                            economic progress. Short-term rates are now about 1-1/4 percent higher
                            than in early 1961, while long-term corporate and municipal rates have
                            changed little, if at all, and mortgage rates have actually declined by
                            an average of 1/2 of 1 percent.</p>
                        <p>Last summer's increase in short-term interest rates and the proposed
                            Interest Equalization Tax brought sharp improvement in our third quarter
                            figures. The third quarter produced the best results of any quarter
                            since 1957. This improvement is being relatively well maintained so far
                            this quarter. Nevertheless, 1963 will show little, if any, improvement
                            over 1962 because of the heavy capital outflows during the first half of
                            the year.</p>
                        <p>For the future it is essential that the $1 billion annual saving in
                            government spending overseas be achieved as scheduled by the end of next
                            year. If at all possible, and I believe it is, the target should be
                            exceeded. It includes $300 million in defense savings overseas which
                            involve numerous redeployments of service and air force combat units.
                            When approving this program, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> to develop recommendations for an additional
                            $300 million in savings. This further program has now been under
                            discussion between State and Defense and with the Joint Chiefs for some
                            months. It should soon be possible to reach firm Presidential decisions
                            on this program. Most of the redeployments involved in the July program
                            will take place either late <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0130"
                            />next spring or next fall, so their full effect will not be felt before
                            1965. Because of the long lead times involved it would be helpful if
                            early decisions could be reached on the additional $300 million program
                            requested by President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                            >Kennedy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Redeployments do not involve combat forces in Germany because Germany is
                            currently fully offsetting the dollar cost of our forces in Germany by
                            the purchase of U.S. made military equipment.</p>
                        <p>Present indications are that 1963 balance of payments results will
                            approximate those of 1962—a deficit of about $3.5 billion before
                            accounting for debt prepayments or other special intergovernmental
                            transactions designed to hold down the final total. After all such
                            transactions, 1963 should approximate the $2.4-$2.2 overall level of
                            1961 and 1962.</p>
                        <p>Assuming enactment of the Interest Equalization Tax and continued
                            vigorous action to hold down dollar expenditures abroad, 1964 should
                            witness a substantial improvement and 1965 could well see the deficit on
                            regular transactions brought down to the neighborhood of $1 billion from
                            the current $3.5 billion.</p>
                        <p>In short, the balance of payments problem is many faceted and requires
                            constant attention on many fronts. However, the combination of the 1961
                            and 1963 programs, plus such further savings as may prove possible in
                            the defense area, now appear to be adequate to bring very substantial
                            improvement over the course of the next year.</p>
                        <p>The likelihood of these future gains may be foreshadowed by the relative
                            improvement in our gold position that is taking place this year. It now
                            looks as if our 1963 gold loss will only approximate $500 million,

                            that we get as much help as possible from the Germans, as promptly as
                            possible, in the negotiations now under way. Particularly important
                            would be German prepayment of the GARIOA debt, increased military
                            procurement in the U.S. and the removal of restrictions on certain of

                            <p>The issue of compensating Germany for U.S. seizure of private German
                                assets during World War II has become of major political importance
                                in Germany and a serious irritant in U.S.-German relations.</p>
                            <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0132"/>
                            <p>Recent discussions with Germany indicate that the Germans may be
                                prepared to conclude a settlement with the new Administration more
                                favorable than we have hitherto been able to negotiate. The probable
                                elements in this settlement would be: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Prepayment to the U.S., immediately, of $600 million of
                                        Ger-many's $787 million GARIOA debt.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>Cancellation of the remaining $187 million of the GARIOA
                                        debt in full settlement of the vested assets—a figure about
                                        half-way between the previous German request of $200 million
                                        and the previous U.S. estimate of $175 million. This
                                        cancellation would have to be submitted to the Senate as a
                                        treaty amending the GARIOA agreement.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>Other actions by Germany to help the U.S. balance of
                                        payments, including increased German military procurement in
                                        the U.S., removal of German restrictions on certain U.S.
                                        agricultural exports, and possibly German payment of a part
                                        of U.S. military aid to Greece and Turkey.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>There is no assurance that the Senate would approve a treaty
                                offsetting vested assets against GARIOA since there is strong
                                Congressional sentiment against any return program. Nevertheless
                                mere submission of the treaty would ease German-U.S. relations and
                                the other proposed actions, including the $600 million GARIOA
                                prepayment, would be of great benefit to the U.S. at the present
                                time.</p>
                            <p>The essential details of the long-continuing and complicated vested

                            and attached memoranda relating to the negotiations with the Germans

                                attached memoranda is in the Supplement.</note> I have taken note of
                            your recommendation that these negotiations be consummated as quickly as
                            possible and, in particular, that the United States be prepared to reach
                            an agreement to recommend legislative action for a limited return
                            program for vested German assets as a contribution on our part to the
                            satisfactory completion of the present negotiations. I am, of course,
                            anxious to have these negotiations consummated quickly and successfully
                            and would hope to proceed with them as soon as the Germans are in a
                            position to translate their broad interest into specific proposals.</p>
                        <p>I do have substantial reservations with respect to any United States
                            commitment to the provision of compensation for vested German assets. It
                            is my understanding that this commitment would be directly related to
                            the prepayment of the GARIOA debt and that the two items would
                            constitute a separate component of the total package under negotiation.
                            My reservations are briefly as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The vested assets question is a highly controversial political
                                    issue in the United States and it is questionable whether it is
                                    wise or feasible at this time to seek Congressional approval to
                                    such a commitment given the past history of the matter. I would
                                    be reluctant to endorse a commitment to submit legislation if
                                    there were no reasonable assurance that approval for such
                                    legislation could be secured.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We are under no legal obligation to compensate the Germans for
                                    these vested assets. Any act of grace on our part would
                                    certainly provoke opposition on the grounds of equity,
                                    particularly from Americans with war damage claims against
                                    Germany who have not yet succeeded in obtaining legislation to
                                    provide for their compensation. In addition, such action would
                                    also lead to considerable pressure from the Swiss for the
                                    settlement of the Interhandel matter<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2"

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Although I regard constructive measures to solve our balance
                                    of payments problem as being of the highest importance, it seems
                                    to me that the Germans have an obligation to make a contribution
                                    to the solution of this problem without the need for any
                                    compensatory action on our part. Even if we should prejudice the
                                    prepayment of the GARIOA debt by our unwillingness to compensate
                                    for the vested assets or to consider the vested assets question
                                    as part of a negotiated package, I believe that adherence to
                                    this principle would outweigh the relatively minor contribution
                                    that the GARIOA debt prepayment would make to a durable <pb

                                    contribution to the solution of our present balance of payments
                                    problem. In particular, negotiations through multilateral

                                    offer a good prospect of obtaining further contributions from

                                    fear that we might well prejudice our position in multilateral
                                    negotiations by establishing the precedent of a negotiated

                        <p>Sir Frank said he hoped these informal discussions would be only the
                            first of a continuing series, particularly because of the relationship
                            of the two reserve currencies. With respect to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> economic situation, he said 1960 had
                            registered high levels of consumption and investment accompanied by a
                            rise in prices and wages. The outlook for 1961 was for internal demand
                            to continue to rise and there was thus a continued need for restraints
                            to provide leeway for exports, although there may be some easing of the
                            heavy import demand because of past inventory build up. He expressed
                            concern over the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> payments outlook for
                            1961 but did not feel it would necessarily be a critical period. If
                            there is a reduced inflow of short-term capital in 1961 and a fall in
                            reserves, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would not be too
                            concerned provided the trend is toward an improved world payments
                            position. He said the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> welcomed the
                            President's balance of payments statement,<note n="1" xml:id="d42fn1"
                                >See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> and that despite
                            some uncertainty over the future the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> should not be deflected from the general purpose of
                            expansion of world trade and the freest possible movement of
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> noted three aspects of
                            the US economic situation: 1) the current recession, 2) the anemic
                            recovery since 1958, and 3) the slowing down in long-term rate of
                            growth. He noted that the peak was reached in the second quarter of 1960
                            when <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> reached $506 billion, and that
                            in the first quarter 1961 <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> was close
                            to $500 billion. The US potential, however, is estimated at $545 to $550
                            billion. Moreover, our rate of growth had declined since 1953. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> said that, without
                            taking account of any new programs contemplated by the new
                            Administration, the forecast was for a gradual rise in <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> during 1961. He noted the problems
                            relating to the strong impact of the federal tax system at high levels
                            of economic activity and the various restraints on monetary policy,
                            especially the balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> referred to the
                            forecast in the British “Outlook” paper,<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">Not
                                further identified.</note> that US <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> would fall by 3 per cent from the 1960 peak and recover
                            from the second half of 1961 onward, and said that our figures indicated
                            a decline of only slightly more than one per cent. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> observed that, again without
                            allowing for special new programs, we foresee an increase in public
                            sector activities and no further substantial softening of the private
                            sector.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Balance of Payments</hi></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> cited an over-all
                            US payments deficit for 1960 of $3.8 billion, which was the same as for
                            1959. About $2.3 billion of the 1960 deficit resulted from short-term
                            capital movements primarily in the second <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110"
                                facs="0136"/>half of the year. Some $1.5 million is considered as a
                            basic deficit. The US expected a better export position in 1961. He
                            referred in this connection to the hope that more canned fruit could be
                            sold to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He referred also to the
                            various steps the US was taking to improve its payments position,
                                e.g.,<gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and military procurement,
                            reduction of duty-free allowances for tourists, and possible action with
                            respect to short term export credits and removal of tax incentives for
                            foreign investment.</p>
                        <p>As to the outlook for the US balance of payments, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we do not wish to
                            prognosticate but thought there was a good chance the US could approach
                            equilibrium with respect to the basic deficit in three to four years.
                            With regard to the special interest rate arrangements, he said it was
                            not our wish to siphon off a substantial amount of funds from Europe,
                            although there may be a modest movement of funds back to this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Frank</persName> said that the US starts from a good trade
                            position while the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> starts from a bad
                            one. He welcomed the US approach which was aimed at improving the basic
                            deficit without doing “direct and manifest” harm to others. US actions
                            may, however, have a short-term effect on sterling. If sterling does
                            come under strain in 1961, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should
                            keep calm, provided the basic trend seems to be in the right direction.
                            He noted that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> deficit rose from
                            ₤120 million in 1959 to ₤180 million in 1960. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> payments outlook for 1961 was far from satisfactory.</p>

                        <p>Sir <persName>Frank</persName> referred to Prime Minister MACMILLAN's
                            meeting with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> on
                            February 23<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3"><persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                    >Adenauer</persName> visited London for private talks with
                                Macmillan February 22-23.</note> and asked for US views on how the
                            basic structural imbalance between surplus and deficit countries could
                            be tackled in concert, and also on the possibility of revaluation of the
                            Deutsche Mark.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that in our
                            efforts to obtain a greater German contribution we were emphasizing the
                            imbalance in world payments arising from the German surplus. We were
                            pressing for expansion of German military equipment purchases in the US,
                            without a reduction in their purchases elsewhere in Europe. Germany
                            could also help on joint use of military facilities, and by military aid
                            to Greece and Turkey. These contributions could well be made by Germany
                            since it received about $1 billion per annum from foreign military
                            expenditures, of which some $675 million came from the US and $200
                            million from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we hoped
                            that with German contributions in the military field and by our own
                            actions, US balance of payments on military account could be helped by
                            some $400 million this year, including $100 million in savings on Greek
                            and Turkish aid, $150 million from <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111"
                                facs="0137"/>German purchases of US military equipment, and possibly
                            $100 million by the US buying material here for the use of our forces in
                            Germany. It was entirely up to the Germans whether they wanted to make
                            debt prepayment, but they could not extract from the US a concession on
                            vested assets. Furthermore, this would be a one-time operation and not
                            an approach to our basic deficit. He stressed the need for a substantial
                            continuing German aid program with untied procurement, although the US
                            would probably get back, through purchases of US goods, only a small
                            percentage of the expenditures.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought the
                            prospects for any meaningful revaluation of the <gloss target="#t_DM1"
                                >DM</gloss> were not good. He understood that at one time the
                            Germans had considered a small adjustment of perhaps 5 per cent, but in
                            his view this would have been inadequate and would have led to
                            speculation. Moreover, it was the Germans' view last year that if they
                            revalued they probably would not have to do other things such as
                            agreeing to the US request for them to increase aid contributions.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Frank</persName> thought that an “adequate revaluation”
                            would help the situation materially. While he agreed that a prolonged
                            period of discussion and speculation followed by a revaluation of only 5
                            per cent would be undesirable, he nevertheless thought something in the
                            neighborhood of 10 per cent would be adequate. He said that he did not
                            maintain that revaluation was an alternative to the other things that
                            Germany should do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that the
                            US places a lower priority on revaluation than the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He did not think revaluation was
                            possible before the fall, nor even then that revaluation above 5 per
                            cent was possible. In the US view even 8 or 10 per cent would not be
                            enough. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> thought
                            that the balance of payments measures we were seeking from the Germans
                            were of the most pressing importance, and that we should move ahead with
                            them before doing anything on revaluation.</p>

                                (cont'd)</hi></p>
                        <p>Sir Frank referred to the previous day's discussions and said that West
                            Germany was at the heart of the British imbalance. He was skeptical of
                            the ability of getting the Germans to take on enough over the long term
                            to overcome their persistent surplus without revaluation. He noted that
                            the German current account surplus was unlikely to be less than $1
                            billion in 1961, and even with a $1 billion German aid program, the
                            Germans probably would not commit more than half nor disburse more than
                            one fourth this year. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> said that the US estimated the 1961 German
                            surplus at about the same figure, and that it was vitally important for
                            the Germans to do more in foreign aid and military purchases abroad.
                            However, if the various measures previously mentioned, including a
                            parallel approach by the British on German military purchases, are
                            carried out, we visualize that the German current surplus could be
                            reduced to some $250 million.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reiterated his
                            view that revaluation was not the answer at this time, and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> pointed out US military costs in
                            dollars might increase with the German revaluation. Sir Frank said he
                            hoped to keep the Prime Minister from raising the question of
                            revaluation with the Germans.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Other Surplus Countries</hi></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we have been
                            impressed by the size of the Italian payments surplus, but that it would
                            be difficult to deal with it without first succeeding with the German
                            surplus. He thought under present programs the British and the French
                            were carrying their share of the foreign <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113"
                                facs="0139"/>aid burden and the problem is to get the French to
                            continue. Sir Frank observed that the French surplus also bears
                            watching; the Japanese problem was a unique one that affected all
                            industrialized countries, whereas the German, French and Italian surplus
                            problems related rather more directly to the US and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> deficit positions. He said that Japan was
                            not extending much aid as distinct from reparations and export credits.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that while
                            there had been success in getting Japan to relax its import
                            restrictions, it had offset this by increasing tariffs. He thought that
                            in view of Japan's interest in Asia, it could be persuaded to increase
                            long term aid to India and Pakistan.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Monetary Matters</hi></p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that for
                            the first time since the 1920's there was convertibility of the major
                            trading currencies. This meant that short term capital flows of the type
                            experienced recently were easier to set off than before, and there was
                            thus a need for much closer cooperation and coordination among the
                            important fiscal and monetary authorities. He noted that the US Treasury
                            was considering the possibility of freeing the interest rate limitations
                            for foreign official balances. The President's message made clear the
                            necessity to maintain US short term interest rates to avoid substantial
                            outflow of short term funds, and at the same time to maintain a
                            different pattern for long term interest rates. He reiterated, however,
                            that it was not the US Government's intention to attract a big return
                            flow of funds from abroad, but rather to stabilize the situation. US
                            Federal Reserve authorities were interested in working out closer
                            contacts with their opposite numbers abroad. Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> raised questions about techniques
                            that needed to be considered on two points: one was the interest rate
                            affecting the short term flow of funds, the other concerned the judgment
                            of central banks whether to hold such funds in gold or dollars. Chairman
                                <persName>Martin</persName> said that exploratory discussions on
                            these matters, both bilateral and multilateral, would be invaluable,
                            particularly in the present atmosphere of convertibility. He also
                            pointed out that the Board's monetary policy would be defensive rather
                            than aggressive with respect to foreign funds.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that the
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> would provide a forum for
                            coordination, although it might not be the only forum nor adequate in
                            terms of size. Sir Frank said that the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            was willing to consider anything that might help moderate the
                            speculative movement of short term funds, but saw difficulty because of
                            the great differences in various domestic economies. For example, the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> problem was one of excessive
                            demand, the US the contrary. Mr. Parsons also concurred in the need to
                            explore every conceivable possibility of cooperation in monetary policy.
                            He wondered whether an interest rate of one or two per cent would be
                            sufficient inducement to change the minds of central banks on whether to
                            hold gold or dollars. He, moreover, did not personally favor splitting
                            markets <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0140"/>into compartments, with
                            one for central banks and the other for private individuals and
                            commercial banks, when in fact the markets are interrelated. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> remarked that these
                            various mechanisms were not considered as being inherently desirable but
                            rather as defensive measures which have been made necessary because some
                            of our friends have placed undue reliance on monetary policy as opposed
                            to fiscal policy. The US felt the two were, of course, complementary.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> stressed the
                            importance to the free world of coordination with Europe in this area at
                            this time. It was the responsibility of the US to assure confidence
                            abroad by showing that the American economy was under control.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Frank</persName> accepted the idea that US action in this
                            field was designed to be defensive and not aggressive.</p>

                                March 13, 1961, pp. 369-370.</note> and Ambassador Dowling had been
                            carrying on talks concerning it in Bonn. The President wanted to make
                            three points perfectly clear: (1) Last year the impression had been
                            created abroad that the United States might withdraw one or two
                            divisions from Western Europe. This was the last thing the United States
                            would do. The President hoped that sufficient adjustments would be made
                            to cope with the situation in other ways, and he was definitely not
                            going to withdraw any divisions from Europe. (2) Last year the
                            impression had been created in Western Germany that the United States
                            felt the burden of maintaining its troops was too heavy from the
                            standpoint of its domestic taxation program and was therefore asking
                            help from Germany. Again the President wanted it to be very clearly
                            understood that the United States was prepared to bear its own
                            international burdens. His only concern was the outflow of gold, as
                            previously indicated. (3) Regarding the outflow of gold, during the past
                            three months the United States has lost 1,200,000,000 <gloss
                                target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss>. The largest amount was lost in January.
                            February and March had shown some improvement. If the rate of the last
                            three months were projected for the entire year, the United States would
                            lose 4 billion <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> in 1961. As previously
                            indicated, the President hoped that the loss would not be as great as
                            that, since some improvement was in the making. The President indicated
                            that we were losing gold in three ways: (1) Last year part of the loss
                            had been occasioned by the interest differentials. That, he understood,
                            had been brought to an end. (2) The United States was losing gold
                            because of its troop payments and maintenance abroad. (3) A large
                            outflow of gold was occasioned by United States aid to under-developed
                            countries. Understandably enough the United States was reluctant to
                            diminish its aid efforts in any way or to diminish its troop maintenance
                            abroad. That would be very bad for both the security of the United
                            States and the joint security of the Free World. Therefore the President
                            was very anxious to diminish the outflow of gold so as not to decrease
                            either foreign aid or troop maintenance. He was thus very much
                            interested in seeing that everything possible was done to lessen the
                            outflow of gold resulting from our maintenance of troops in the Federal
                            Republic. The joint utilization of facilities should be a very helpful
                            step. Moreover, he hoped that the purchase of supplies in the United
                            States <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0142"/>could be encouraged,
                            since this would be a second very significant step forward. Somehow, the
                            President felt, this matter would have to be brought into balance before
                            the end of the year in order to permit the United States to carry out
                            its commitments on a world-wide basis.</p>
                        <p>The President continued by stating that the United States net deficit
                            each year because of the maintenance of troops, etc., in Germany amounts
                            to 350 million dollars in gold. This constitutes approximately one third
                            of the total gold loss; last year it was one quarter; this year, if the
                            improved trends continue, this sum might possibly constitute one half of
                            the overall gold loss. The President hoped that the Federal Republic
                            would work closely together with the United States to find means of
                            diminishing this deficit.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor stated that he well understood the United States position
                            and problem in this respect. He understood that the United States had
                            undertaken steps to improving the situation. It had, for example,
                            introduced compulsory savings among the troops in Germany and had banned
                            the sale of German products in the PXs. The Chancellor welcomed these
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he hoped these matters could be explored
                            further through Ambassador Dowling and Under Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. It was necessary to strike a
                            better balance since that would improve the overall situation of the
                            United States.</p>

                            political questions at State, he had also had talks with Mr. <persName

                            in the U.S. aide-memoire to the Germans last February,<note n="3"

                                Documents, 1961, pp. 472-474.</note> as well as the role which
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> had
                            played in resolving the earlier problem of U.K. troop costs in Germany,
                            and inquired whether we were intending to bring the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> into the current U.S.-German balance
                            of payments talks in any way.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> replied that we
                            were not, and that earlier statements suggesting we would had not been
                            well thought out. Explaining the way in which we see this problem, he
                            mentioned that there had been a sharp improvement in the U.S. balance of
                            payments since last winter but said the turn in the cyclical situation
                            here could be expected to create pressure on our balance of payments
                            again. Therefore, there was need to keep on working on this question.
                            The essential problem here was to make our export earnings cover our
                            non-trade international outlays, and the largest of these were our
                            military expenditures abroad. Our outlays for foreign economic aid were
                            less of a burden on our balance of payments because of our policy of
                            tying these expenditures to exports; last year the balance of payments
                            effect of foreign aid had been perhaps $1 billion but in the next year
                            or two we were hoping to reduce this effect to about $500-$700 million
                            per year.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Germany, he said, we felt that their balance of payments
                            surplus was the counterpart of both the U.S. and the U.K. deficits.
                            Action by us alone to correct the situation would merely result in
                            shifting our deficit to the British, and therefore the primary need was
                            for the Germans to take appropriate action. We could not, of course,
                            tell them just what actions they ought to take. Their recent revaluation
                            of the Deutsche mark was directed to this problem, but was not by itself
                            adequate to resolve it. Larger capital exports by Germany were another
                            way of dealing with it, and here he thought that progress was being
                            made. Finally, we had thought one easy way for the Germans to meet this
                            problem would be for them to increase their procurement of military
                            equipment abroad. The Germans had recently reached agreement with the
                            United Kingdom on an increase in such procurement. Our own talks with
                            the Germans were continuing, and were not too satisfactory so far.</p>
                        <p>Independently of these negotiations, he said, it looked as though German
                            military procurement orders from the United States would increase
                            somewhat this year, but this would not be enough. The gap between <pb
                                n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0144"/>such German procurement here
                            and our own military expenditures in Germany currently amounted to
                            around $400 million per year. Our own directives designed to minimize
                            the foreign exchange spending of our military might reduce this gap,
                            possibly to something like $200-$250 million. Thus, if we could get the
                            Germans to buy about $200 million more of military equipment from us
                            annually, that would largely solve this problem. We felt this was a
                            reasonable request, in view of the German financial strength and their
                            lack of a large domestic armaments industry, and therefore we were
                            continuing to press them on it. Another subject we were also discussing
                            with the Germans—which he indicated the Ambassador was familiar
                            with—related to possible joint use of various military facilities.</p>
                        <p>He mentioned that, in the earlier stages of our talks with the Germans,
                            they had responded that this was a multilateral matter—why should we
                            pick on them alone? However, when we had taken them up on this and
                            agreed that the problem of their surplus was multilateral in its
                            effects, they seemed to lose interest in multilateral discussions. Thus,
                            we now had no specific intentions of any <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> discussion of this matter. The earlier U.K. case,
                            which the Secretary General had cited, was really quite different in a
                            number of respects. We did of course want all appropriate international
                            organizations to continue the general multilateral pressure on the
                            Germans to do more about their surplus, but we intended to keep our
                            procurement talks with them on a bilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Finletter suggested that the Secretary General might, however,
                            want to consider—when the currently-planned discussion and review of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military planning was
                            completed—whether some of the countries with greater financial
                            capability could usefully be asked to provide appropriate military
                            equipment assistance to other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. The Secretary noted that, during our talks last year with the
                            Germans, we had tried to suggest their extending such military
                            assistance to other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries but
                            had been unsuccessful. If the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            could, as its review of national military plans proceeded, get the
                            Germans or others to do something along this line, that would certainly
                            be fine. We had come to recognize that there was merit in the German
                            reluctance to provide such military aid on a bilateral basis, and had
                            stopped pressing them on it.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, the Secretary reiterated that, despite what had been said in
                            our February aide-memoire, both we and the Germans preferred to keep our
                            talks on a bilateral basis. However, he was in agreement with the
                            Ambassador's suggestion that an ultimate decision by <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> calling for greater conventional
                            forces might create a problem of military assist-ance programs among
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries which would be of a
                            multilateral character. Mr. Sullivan called attention, in this
                            connection, to the great difficulties which had been encountered in
                            arriving at a satisfactory multilateral <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119"
                                facs="0145"/>sharing of the relatively small costs involved in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> infrastructure programs. The
                            Ambassador and the Secretary General felt this experience was not
                            necessarily conclusive, and possibly a large multilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> cost-sharing arrangement would be
                            easier.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General then inquired whether he could assume, similarly,
                            that the United States did not have any idea of pressing in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for establishment of a burden-sharing
                            formula. The Secretary replied that this was correct. Establishment of
                            any such formula was a very difficult and complex matter and would not
                            be feasible—although we had in connection with discussions in the <gloss
                                target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>, for example, made reference to the
                            statistics on the relative burdens which are being carried by various
                            countries. In doing so, we had included defense costs along with other
                            considerations—and, in the U.S. case, this of course meant our total
                            military costs, including for example our large expenditures on atomic
                            energy. The Germans, he indicated, had backed away from discussion of
                            formulas after looking at the U.S. figures, and the references made to
                            burden-sharing in our February aide-memoire had been intended only to
                            exert general pressure on them to deal with their balance of payments
                            surplus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General mentioned the question of the United Kingdom and
                            the Common Market, indicating he had some doubt whether the British
                            would decide to join on conditions which would be acceptable to the rest
                            of us. In response, the Secretary referred to the impressions Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had gained from his
                            conversations. He himself felt there had clearly been a marked change in
                            the U.K. position, but we could not of course be equally certain of a
                            successful outcome. There had not been any change in the U.S. position
                            on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General alluded, finally, to the problem of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> mission to Greece and Turkey. Only
                            the Italians had so far offered a candidate. The Germans also were
                            willing to, but the British had no interest and he was still looking for
                            a third candidate. It was possible the Netherlands might supply one. The
                            Secretary asked whether Tinbergen might be available. The Secretary
                            General agreed Tinbergen was a very good man, but thought the
                            Netherlands Government might be reluctant to propose him. The Secretary
                            suggested they might perhaps do so if no other candidate were found.</p>

                        <p>Since announcing an intention in October 1960 to provide on a continuing
                            basis aid to less-developed countries, the Germans have made significant
                            progress in this area and further substantial progress is expected. An
                            aid program of <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 5 billion ($1.25
                            billion) for 1961-62 is under way, this amount corresponding to almost 1
                            percent of the German <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, a ratio
                            suggested by the United States as an aid target for member countries of

                        <p>In accordance with your instructions, Ambassador Dowling has set in
                            motion arrangements under which joint working groups composed of US and
                            German military experts are meeting to examine (1) German military
                            requirements over the next 5 years, looking to increased procurement <pb
                                n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0147"/>in the United States; (2)
                            military logistics facilities which may be available for joint use on a
                            shared-expense, leasing or similar financial arrangement and (3) the
                            possibility of reduction in costs of contractual services for our
                            military establishment in Germany, which now amount to approximately
                            $270 million annually.</p>
                        <p>German military orders in the United States total $208 million for the
                            first six months of 1961, as compared with an average annual level of
                            $225 million for preceding years. The German Defense Ministry has
                            proposed that our Defense Department undertake to handle German military
                            procurement in the United States on a contract basis; if this
                            arrangement can be worked out, we would expect it to pay off in
                            increased procurement.</p>
                        <p>German military procurement includes an order for two battalions of
                            Pershing missiles ($130 million), which the United States has accepted
                            subject to the possibility of changes in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> force goals or in deployment of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> weapons which might affect
                            fulfillment of the contract for these missiles. This order replaced a
                            previous contract for Mace missiles.</p>
                        <p>Defense Minister Strauss has stated his willingness to place considerably
                            larger orders in the United States, provided what he characterized as
                            deficiencies in some categories of US military equipment are overcome by
                            joint US/German development. At our request, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> is presently examining Strauss' assertions, looking to
                            a discussion with him on this point when he comes to Washington on July
                                14.<note n="3" xml:id="d46fn3">No record of this visit has been

                        <p>As you know, the Germans revalued their deutschemark by approximately 5
                            percent in March 1961, which among other things will make our exports to
                            Germany more competitive and make German exports more expensive.</p>
                        <p>The German Government prepaid $587 million of its postwar debt to the
                            United States, leaving a balance of $200 million. This increment
                            benefited our liquidity position.</p>
                        <p>Certain US products, notably poultry, were recently liberalized by the
                            German Government for importation, resulting in an immediate increase in
                            the volume of exports of these items to the Federal Republic. This
                            action stemmed from our balance of payments discussions with the
                            Germans.</p>

                            before Congress leaves announce that we are going to put this on a must
                            basis of legislation next year that will make it retroactive to
                            September 1st of this year. Would that help discourage a flow in the
                            next four months?</p>

                        <p>I refer to your memorandum on gold, dated August 28, 1961.<note n="1"

                        <p>Our net gold loss this year amounts to $274 million. This may be compared
                            to losses during similar eight-month periods of 1958, 1959 and <pb
                                n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0149"/>1960 that amounted to $1,775
                            million, $1,013 million and $462 million, respectively. (See table
                                attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The important trends are as follows. Heavy gold sales began in 1958 and
                            continued through February of this year. The $5.4 billion loss brought
                            our total gold stock down to $17.4 billion. The combined effects of this
                            Administration's statements with respect to the dollar and our balance
                            of payments, the psychological and real impact of our improved balance
                            of payments, and the cooperative steps taken by the Basle group of
                            central banks, all combined to bring the losses to a halt in March.
                            During July and August, however, we again sustained net losses totaling
                            $72 million. In the absence of the $150 million received from the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, the loss would have been greater.</p>
                        <p>The reappearance of net gold sales is significant, and there are distinct
                            possibilities of some further losses in the months ahead. To some
                            extent, of course, we must expect changing economic positions of various
                            countries to lead to gold movements if gold is going to serve as the
                            base for our international monetary system. But the present and
                            foreseeable period may also show some disturbing strains.</p>
                        <p>We are taking steps to reduce the possibility of drains from the three
                            major sources of possible gold demand. Some demand may result from
                            further shifts of the funds received by Britain from its drawing on the
                            Monetary Fund. Additional payments of British debts to Switzerland,
                            which is not a member of the Fund, are scheduled and it is likely that
                            those dollar receipts will be converted into gold. Although our
                            understanding with the British is to the effect that its drawing will
                            not be used in a way that would pose a demand for gold from us,
                            nevertheless disposition of the proceeds to other countries may result
                            in such demand. In this connection, we are emphasizing to the British
                            the nature of our understanding, and attempting to assure that any gold
                            loss will be minimized.</p>
                        <p>Some demand may result from activity in the London gold market. The major
                            part of this week's gold loss represented sales to the Bank of England
                            to offset its losses in the market. We may have further sales to the
                            Bank of England for this same reason.</p>
                        <p>I do not feel that the recent increase in demand for gold on the London
                            market indicates an international judgment that the dollar is in a
                            weakened position against other currencies. Rather the activity appears
                            largely to have reflected an upsurge in private hoarding and speculative
                            demand, owing in good measure to the heightened tensions associated with
                            Berlin and other aspects of the world political situation.</p>
                        <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>However, confidential information indicates that there have been some
                            central bank purchases in that market. By far the largest has been the
                            Bank of Italy. We have sent a representative of the Federal Reserve to
                            Italy to advise them that it would be preferable for them to buy
                            directly from us rather than putting up the price on the London gold
                            market. As a result we now have the assurance that the central bank of
                            Italy will not participate further in the market.</p>
                        <p>Despite this, continued demand on the London market seems likely for the
                            immediate future, in the absence of a notable improvement in the
                            international political situation. We are in close touch with the
                            British regarding this market in order to assure that no rapid price
                            rise occurs to excite speculation. Moreover, we are careful to avoid any
                            public expression of undue concern over the gold situation inasmuch as
                            such concern might in itself stimulate capital flight.</p>
                        <p>The third source of potential demand in the near future lies in
                            short-term capital movements. Some flows of funds from the United States
                            to Britain are now being reported in response to interest rate
                            differentials. Other flows of significant amount have taken place from
                            certain European countries to Switzerland. Such flow of funds may at
                            times tend to lodge in those countries which hold a high proportion of
                            their reserves in the form of gold. In view of the high volatility of
                            short-term capital it is essential that our short-term interest rates do
                            not decline. We will also want to continue to pursue vigorously our own
                            foreign exchange operations which can help to minimize speculation and
                            reduce the attractiveness of moving funds because of differentials in
                            interest rates here and abroad. You will recall the numerous
                            authorizations we have sought from you in order to strengthen our
                            activities in this field.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the balance of payments generally, there has been a
                            deterioration since the first quarter of this year. I do not feel at
                            this point that our gold losses have been related directly to this
                            worsening. However, continuing payments deficits will further increase
                            the liquid dollar holdings of foreign countries. Although private
                            accounts may absorb some portion of such dollar gains, most of the
                            additions are likely to go into official reserves. It is significant
                            that a number of countries have increased the amounts of dollars they
                            are currently willing to hold as a proportion of their total reserves.
                            Nevertheless, further additions may well occasion conversions into gold.
                            In addition, there is always the pervasive influence of such deficits on
                            confidence in the dollar.</p>
                        <p>I will be discussing the general financial situation at the Vienna
                            meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in
                                September.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">Regarding U.S. participation
                                in these Vienna meetings, see <ref target="#d50">Documents 50</ref>
                                and <ref target="#d51">51</ref>.</note> I am hopeful that the
                            outcome of these meetings will show the <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                facs="0151"/>determination of the financial representatives of the
                            member governments to cooperate even more and help dampen speculative
                            and hoarding activity. Real progress there toward the plan for standby
                            credit facilities in the International Monetary Fund should help to calm
                            the financial markets.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above considerations, I do not recommend that the
                            Administration take any new action now. But I continue to feel that we
                            must seek active implementation of the various measures which you have
                            already directed. In particular, we should press forward with our
                            efforts to stimulate and encourage our export trade; it is significant
                            that our trade surplus has declined a bit and the recovery of our
                            economy will add to import demand. We should also press forward to gain
                            a more equitable sharing with our allies of economic and military
                            aid.</p>
                        <p>I interpret your reference to legislation to refer to our proposals to
                            eliminate tax deferrals or impose changes respecting “tax haven”
                            corporations. I do not think that a public statement indicating that
                            these changes should apply retroactively to the latter part of this year
                            would help our gold position significantly during the next few months.
                            Such a statement, which would be contrary to our general philosophy
                            about retroactivity in tax proposals, might well be considered an
                            expression of undue concern about the gold situation on our part, and
                            might actually run the risk of accelerating our losses. However, it may
                            well be desirable for you to give strong personal and public support to
                            our proposal to tax foreign “tax haven” corporations when it comes up
                            next January before the Ways and Means Committee.</p>

                        <p>In view of the uncertainties concerning the exact composition of the next
                            Cabinet and even certain doubts that <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                >Adenauer</persName> will succeed himself as Chancellor, I believe
                            that raising these two questions with Brentano at the Foreign Ministers
                            meeting would not produce any immediate results. He is bound to give
                            standard answer that nothing can be done until after the elections.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand I believe that question of pressures on US balance of
                            payments in connection with augmentation of US forces should be brought
                            forcefully to his attention, if for no other reason than to get this

                            early date following the formation of new Cabinet, which will not be
                            established until after new Bundestag convenes on Oct 17. Care should be

                        <p>Re future FedRep development aid program, several important decisions are

                            commitment authority to be sought in 1962 budget law. According our
                            info, <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> and EconMin staff level,
                            with concurrence Brentano and <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName>, favor 1962 legal commitment authority for
                            bilateral development loans (KFW fund) in neighborhood <gloss

                                >DM</gloss> 3.9 billion bilateral loan portion present 1961-1962
                            program) in order continue forward momentum of program. Finance
                            Ministry, on other hand, is holding out for considerable smaller
                            commitment authority. This issue will have to be resolved fairly soon
                            after formation new Cabinet in order permit 1962 budget planning go
                            forward. Question of 1962 cash appropriations far less important since
                            KFW already has more than enough funds assured to cover expected
                            disbursement level for 1961 and 1962. FedRep bilateral loan commitments
                            for 1961 already exceed <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 5 billion.</p>
                        <p>A second, more important but less immediate, issue is need for FedRep to
                            develop long-term aid program for period beyond 1962 commensurate with
                            its capabilities and responsibilities. I believe we should <pb n="128"
                                xml:id="pg_128" facs="0154"/>press for this too but we should allow
                            new Cabinet time to settle down and attend to most urgent questions
                            before doing so.</p>
                        <p>In addition discussing above with Brentano, I suggest it would be highly
                            useful to raise both points with Etzel at Vienna meeting, particularly
                            need for substantial commitment authority in 1962 (see A-304).<note

                            expenditures involved in the augmentation of US forces in Germany will
                            be considered. In this connection, it may be anticipated that State will
                            be asked to join Treasury and Defense in agreeing to the position
                            incorporated in the Treasury draft of September 29, 1961 (Tab A).<note

                            position contemplates the early expansion of the scope of the current
                            negotiations (underway since April and directed at correcting an
                            existing military payments imbalance) to include consideration of the
                            additional financial problems which will develop in the event that US
                            forces in Germany are augmented. The Ambassador, on the other hand
                            (Bonn's 700 at Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d52fn3">Not attached. A copy
                                is ibid., 811.10/9-2261.</note> has recommended that the current
                            negotiations be pursued to a conclusion and that the problems associated
                            with a possible augmentation of the US forces be considered separately
                            in a negotiating framework which emphasizes primarily the common defense
                            rather than the balance of payments aspects.</p>

                        <p>The current balance of payments negotiations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> have as their objective the conclusion
                            of a multi-element package which will largely offset the present US
                            military payments deficit.</p>
                        <p>A major element of this package is increased German military procurement
                            in the United States. The Embassy has recently estimated, on <pb n="130"
                                xml:id="pg_130" facs="0156"/>the basis of discussions held thus far,
                            that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> procurement for the period
                            January 1961-March 1962 will be approximately $400-450 million.</p>
                        <p>In its draft, the Treasury notes that the technical level discussions of
                            the various package elements have been slow. While true, it should be
                            noted that this cannot be attributed solely to problems raised by the
                            German negotiators. (Some of these, in connection with a long-term
                            German commitment on procurement, are elaborated upon in a recent
                            Embassy draft on this subject at Tab C.)<note n="4" xml:id="d52fn4">Not

                            attributable to delays in Washington guidance on such key points as
                            joint use of facilities, reduction of US war reserves, availability of
                            weapons systems, and use of facilities in third countries.</p>

                            concluded, an additional foreign exchange problem of sizeable dimensions
                            will arise if US forces in Germany are augmented. In anticipation of
                            this the Ambassador has made certain recommendations for raising this
                            problem with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. From the summary
                            of his recommendations and the summary of the Treasury-Defense position
                            below, it appears that there is agreement on the objective but not on

                            negotiations be actively pursued to a conclusion. He favors early resort

                                        <item>no package proposal presently envisaged can provide
                                            the leverage we require. (In the Treasury draft
                                            substantial negotiating leverage is attributed to the
                                            readiness of Defense to provide German forces with a
                                            Cooperative Logistics System. Whether this is in fact
                                            the case cannot be determined until the term Cooperative
                                            Logistics System as used by Treasury and Defense is more
                                            precisely defined so that all three agencies have a
                                            clear understanding of what is being offered, as well as
                                            what the offer is worth. It is important, for example,
                                            to understand that giving the Germans a supply service
                                            and sharing our reserves with them applies only to those
                                            military items which we both use. The offer to share war
                                            reserves may have less magic than is implied, since in
                                            event of hostilities we, as the Germans and our other
                                            Allies are aware, would share these reserves. Thus the
                                            Germans may be unwilling to pay for something they would
                                            expect to get for nothing if the need arises. Another
                                            consideration is that the bulk of our military supplies
                                            are stored in France. The French would, of course, have
                                            to be informed of any large scale US-German sharing
                                            arrangement. This could be a particular problem if, in
                                            order to share our equipment with the Germans, it became
                                            necessary to construct additional facilities in
                                            France.</item>

                                            result in the slowing down of the current

                        <p>The Ambassador proposes in essence that the financial problems of the
                            augmentation be covered within a political framework, with the Germans
                            simply being asked to take on this increment in our foreign exchange
                            deficit as a responsibility of their country in the present
                            international situation. The Ambassador suggests that prior to October
                            17, he and, if possible, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> or Deputy Defense Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> lay before the Germans the
                            entire range of problems arising out of US and <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> preparedness actions. The objective of this
                            presentation would be to impress upon the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> the need for urgent action and to lay the groundwork
                            for the political decisions which the new <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> Government must take. Shortly after the new government
                            is installed, i.e., after October 17, the Ambassador proposes that
                            negotiations on the specific problem of meeting the costs of augmenting
                            the US forces take place in Bonn. The Ambassador would hope to be joined
                            by State, Defense and Treasury representatives from Washington,
                            preferably at the Under Secretary level.</p>

                        <p>Substantively, the Treasury-Defense position contemplates an immediate

                            expeditiously as possible. The US augmentation problem should be raised
                            separately at the political level along the lines proposed by the

                            Minister Franz Josef Strauss signed a memorandum of understanding that
                            envisioned the creation of a military cooperative logistics system
                            between the two governments. These arrangements resulted from the U.S.
                            Government's recognition of the need to provide a sufficient supply line
                            for the expanding Germany military forces and the economic advantages of
                            cooperation in the military production field as well as the necessity of
                            dealing with the drain on the U.S. balance of payments caused by the
                            stationing of substantial numbers of U.S. military forces in West
                            Germany.</p>
                        <p>The text of the memorandum of understanding reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>"The Minister of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany and the
                            Deputy Secretary of Defense of the United States have reviewed the <pb

                            have been jointly conducted by the two countries of the possibilities of
                            increased mutual cooperation and assistance in military matters. They
                            have concluded that a cooperative logistics system is feasible and
                            desirable, and express their intention that formula agreements and
                            detailed procedural arrangements to establish such a system be entered
                            into expeditiously between appropriate representatives of the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>"It is understood that the cooperative logistics system contemplated by
                            this memorandum will include the following major features: cost sharing
                            in research and development projects; procurement services in the United
                            States; depot supply support and depot maintenance services in Europe;
                            sale of United States war reserve stocks prepositioned in Europe;
                            storage facilities; and joint use of major and local United States
                            training areas in Germany.</p>
                        <p>"It is anticipated that under the proposed cooperative logistics system
                            payments by the Federal Republic of Germany to the United States for
                            materiel and for research, development, procurement, supply, maintenance
                            and other logistic services, including the Federal Republic of Germany's
                            share of the system's capital and operating expenses, will be sufficient
                            to insure that military transactions of direct benefit to the U.S.
                            balance of payments are large enough to offset the transactions of U.S.
                            forces in Germany of benefit to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            balance of payments, on the basis of such forces presently stationed in
                            Germany or heretofore announced for movement to Germany. In the event of
                            further deployment of U.S. forces to Germany, the two governments will
                            consider methods whereby the balance of payments effect of such
                            movements can be adjusted to their mutual benefit.” (Telegram 981 from

                        <p>On January 8, 1962, the International Monetary Fund announced that its
                            Board of Directors had reached agreement with 10 major industrialized
                            countries on general arrangements by which the Fund could borrow
                            supplementary funds. “This decision,” the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> announcement stated, “sets out the terms and conditions
                            under which such borrowing will be possible in order to enable the Fund
                            to fulfill more effectively its role in the international monetary
                            system under conditions of convertibility, including greater freedom for
                            short-term capital movements.” Under these arrangements, the United
                            States agreed to lend up to $2 billion <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135"

                            Fund were spelled out in exchanges of letters among the 10 nations. For

                            aware, improvements in the current balance of payments will be at best
                            slow. Such improvements do contribute to a stronger U.S. position in the
                            international financial markets, they do not change the fundamental
                            problem created by large foreign holdings of dollars which may be turned
                            into gold at the pleasure of the holders. It is chiefly to this problem
                            that the papers are addressed.</p>

                                In accordance with your request, I asked Jim Tobin and Bob Roosa to
                                comment on it. Doug Dillon added his comments to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>'s (Tab 2, Tobin; Tab 3,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>; Tab 4, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>). Loucheim's most important
                                idea is that we should agree with the other major holders of gold on
                                what ratios of gold we should hold on our total foreign exchange
                                reserves. This would result in the present world gold stocks
                                supporting a greater total of liquidity, and would have the effect
                                of ruling out runs on our gold by foreign central banks holding
                                dollars. The removal of the 25 per cent gold cover requirement for
                                our internal currency circulation which Loucheim suggests is a
                                necessary step to putting his major proposal into effect.</item>

                            <item><p>Tobin and <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> agree on
                                    the accuracy of Loucheim's diagnosis of the problem and on the
                                    ultimate desirability of his proposal for agreed fixed reserve
                                    ratios. The great difference between them is that Tobin thinks
                                    both that this is a practical proposition and that it is
                                    necessary for us to move in this direction fairly soon.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> doubts its
                                    practicality, and further, he is much more certain that the

                                    and Bob Roosa are confident that they have the situation well in
                                    hand, that the various steps they are taking—which by their
                                    nature tend to be obscure and closely held—are the best that can
                                    be done now and that any large-scale changes are impossible
                                    either because the Europeans won't agree to them or because it
                                    would be a dangerous sign of weakness on our part to propose
                                    them. The Council position, on the other hand, is that some
                                    fundamental change in the mechanism of international payments is
                                    necessary. Further, it is dangerous to wait to make this change
                                    for some indefinite future time, 2, 3, or 4 years from now when
                                    we achieve an equilibrium or a surplus in our balance of
                                    payments. The inhibiting influence the gold problem has
                                    exercised on our domestic economic policy and the high price we
                                    will have to pay in foreign policy programs if we feel we must
                                    cut overseas military and foreign aid expenditures to the bone
                                    are the chief arguments in favor of the Council's position that
                                    we make a large step in the near future. The differences of
                                    viewpoint involved are illustrated by the contrast of a single
                                    pair of figures. All the operations which <persName

                                    memorandum have resulted in our holding $400 million worth of
                                    foreign currencies in our reserves. If we carried out a plan
                                    such as Loucheim suggests we might wish to hold something of the
                                    order of $3 or $4 billion worth of foreign currencies in our
                                    reserves and correspondingly less gold.</p></item>

                                    transfer of gold from U.S. to other countries as the price of
                                    protecting us against the risk of uncontrollable runs on our

                                letter of Bruno Saager<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">Not further
                                    identified.</note> to Prince Radziwill (Tab 6). At the meeting,
                                Bob Roosa really didn't answer your question of what was wrong with
                                Saager's idea of increasing the price of gold in all currencies.
                                First, it is better than doing nothing. It will solve our short-run
                                problem, as well as increasing world liquidity. However, it is far
                                from the best way of solving the problem and it has a number of
                                disadvantages. First, the benefits go to the Soviets, to the South
                                Africans, and to a very small extent, to Canadian and American gold
                                mining companies who will be encouraged to mine more gold by the
                                higher price. We combine giving advantages to the Soviets and to the
                                South Africans with increasing our own and Canadian production of
                                something we don't really need. Second, it leaves the basic problem
                                of the inadequacies of the international monetary mechanism
                                untouched, although it clearly postpones the particular problem we
                                have to face for a number of years. It will still be true that
                                movements of gold need not be related to the real needs of
                                international trade and finance. If we are to exert our efforts to
                                get the continental European countries to agree to this proposition,
                                we might do better to use these efforts toward a more useful end.
                                Third, it is a move which creates something of the same problems for
                                us that devaluation would create. It encourages gold speculators. It
                                probably leads to some lack of confidence in the dollar, even though
                                it helps our immediate position greatly. Since it will justify the
                                passion for holding gold, it will strengthen rather than weaken
                                speculative motives in the international money market. These are,
                                after all, the source of a large part of our troubles.</item>

                                brief essay that J.M. Keynes wrote in 1930 (Tab 9). It remains the
                                most elegant statement of the fundamental proposition that a
                                rational international payment system could dispense with gold
                                altogether. The great attention paid to gold is another myth. The
                                last few sentences are now again as apposite as they were in 1930.

                        <p>The vulnerability of the dollar to failures of confidence means that the
                            U.S. Government is not master in its own house. For unless the
                            international financial community, taking its cues from Wall Street, has
                            “confidence,” there can always be a speculative run.</p>

                            rates this summer in spite of the economic slowdown at home—in effect,
                            New York bankers have learned that one way to get higher interest rates
                            on their loans is to talk down the dollar abroad.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is argued that a tax cut or a budget deficit must be avoided, or
                            timed, or limited, so as to nurse “confidence.”</p>
                        <p>Thus U.S. military or aid outlays may be bad for “confidence”—it takes a
                            broader and longer view to see more in these policies than dollar
                            drains.</p>

                            a steel price increase and a stock market boom would also have been
                            regarded as unfavorable signals.</p>

                        <p>We cannot and do not seek to avoid the adjustments needed to eliminate
                            the basic deficit in our balance of payments. Our basic deficit is not
                            large, and it is declining, cost and price increases in Europe are
                            slowly but surely working for us. The basic deficit is a danger only
                            because its continuation may contribute to a speculative run. By itself
                            it is clearly within our ability to finance for several more years with
                            gold or credit—or to eliminate by drastic action. But hasty drastic
                            action is what we want to avoid—we don't want to impair the defense or
                            development of the Free World, or to restrict trade with new tariffs and
                            quotas, or to slow down economic growth in the U.S. and the Free World.
                            With the time which an agreement would give us, we can balance our

                            the Canadian dollar got in trouble, Canada took measures to deflate its
                            economy, restrict its imports, and draw funds from the U.S. Yet Canada's
                            problem was not inflation, but—like our own—unemployment and excess
                            capacity. Canada's measures increased the pressure on the U.S. dollar.
                            If we are forced to react similarly—tighter money, less expansionary
                            budget policy, trade restrictions—we will in turn transmit deflationary
                            pressures to Japan, the underdeveloped world, and even to Europe.</p>

                        <p>Quite apart from the temporary difficulties of the dollar, the world
                            payments system needs to be systematically improved: (a) to defend all
                            currencies against speculative attacks, (b) to internationalize the
                            burden of providing international money, which now falls almost wholly
                            on the dollar, and (c) to provide for an orderly increase in world
                            liquid reserves to finance growth in trade and production. A permanent
                            agreement can be negotiated, and the necessary legislation (like repeal
                            of the gold cover) obtained from Congress, only if the monetary system
                            is in the interim defended against rumor and speculation.</p>

                            basis. There are great advantages to a systematic, public, formal,

                                exploring among themselves their practices in holding gold as part
                                of their reserves. The starting point for these discussions might be
                                a mutual recognition of the fact that each country will expect to
                                maintain some basic “hard core” of its reserves in the form of gold,
                                but that maintenance of a viable monetary system depends upon a
                                mutual effort to economize in the use of gold for the remaining
                                portion. Attention would thus be turned toward the absolute volume
                                of desired gold holdings, rather than toward the potentially more
                                intractable question of ratios. Mutually understood guidelines for
                                the total gold holdings of each would then minimize pressures for
                                competitive takings from the United States, and set an outer limit
                                of, say, not more than $1 billion on their potential increases in
                                gold holdings over the next two years, including any amount picked

                        <p>Attached is the report which Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">John Leddy</persName> and Assistant
                            Secretary of State Griffith Johnson have made to us on their trip to
                            Europe to confer with the French and British on the Declaration of Ten.
                            A copy of the draft communique which the Finance Ministers of the Ten
                            will issue after their meeting is attached to the report. It has been
                            approved by us and by the French Minister of Finance and the British
                            Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
                        <p>The communique is designed to show that the leading countries are
                            continuing to work closely together in monetary matters; that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> standby is readily available for use;
                            that present resources are adequate to maintain the present price of
                            gold; that further study of long-range improvements in the monetary
                            field is desirable, and that meetings of the Ten are not necessarily
                            concerned with an emergency like a U.S. drawing.</p>
                        <p>France's partners in the Common Market agreed during the trip to a
                            meeting of the Ten, but not to a communique. The French believe that
                            they will, however, agree to its issuance, possibly with some changes
                            reflecting their views.</p>
                        <p>The French Finance Minister said that he had discussed his proposal that
                            gold takings from the United States be limited with the Chancellor of
                            the Exchequer, who had agreed with him that high-level secret
                            discussions should be carried on among the United States, the United
                            Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy after the Bank-Fund meetings. Their
                            ideas are still unclear to us and may not be known in full even to the
                            most trusted subordinates of the two Ministers. We will follow this
                            matter closely and keep you advised of developments.</p>

                                welcomed the idea of a ministerial meeting of the group of ten
                                during the Fund and Bank meeting and the issuance by them of a
                                communique. The attached draft text, which was approved by
                                Washington during the course of our negotiations, has been endorsed
                                by Minister of Finance Giscard d'Estaing, and Chancellor of the
                                Exchequer Maudling. The significance of the communique lies in these

                            <p>The attitude of France's Common Market partners toward the proposed
                                communique is still unclear. While we were having our first meeting
                                with the British (Wednesday, September 5) the French discussed the
                                proposal with the Monetary Committee of the Six. At our second
                                meeting with the French on Thursday (the first having been on
                                Tuesday) they reported that while all were agreed on the
                                desirability of a ministerial meeting of the Ten, the group had not
                                yet agreed in principle on the desirability of a communique. This
                                hesitation was attributed primarily to the views of Van Lennep
                                (Dutch Treasurer-General and chairman of Working Party 3) and de
                                Stryker of Belgium. The Germans (Emminger of the Bundesbank) seemed
                                to be on both sides of the question.</p>
                            <p>Upon hearing this view we informed de Lattre that we saw no point in
                                a meeting without a communique. He responded by saying the French
                                now thought a meeting very important; and that the rest of the Six
                                would no doubt agree on a useful communique along the lines of the
                                draft now virtually agreed upon by the U.S., U.K. and France.</p>
                            <p>The upshot is that the French will issue invitations to the meeting
                                to all of the group of ten and will enclose with the invitation a
                                copy of the attached draft of the communique. The ministerial
                                meeting will be held on Tuesday, September 18 with issuance of the
                                communique scheduled for Wednesday evening or Thursday morning after
                                the Governors have made their major statements to the Fund.
                                Officials of the Ten will meet Monday afternoon to work out such
                                changes in the communique as may be needed to take account of views

                            <p>We raised this question casually at the end of our meeting with
                                Giscard d'Estaing (Tuesday, September 4) by asking whether he had
                                any information to give us following his talks with Maudling on July
                                27. He said he was encouraged by Maudling's reaction. The two were
                                in agreement that there should be high level secret discussions of
                                the subject (which he did not at any time define) after the Fund and
                                Bank meetings were out of the way; and that France, the U.K.,
                                Germany, Italy and the U.S. should be represented in these
                                talks.</p>
                            <p>We did not press this matter further. Apart from its sensitivity and
                                the probability that nothing much could be accomplished until after
                                the Fund and Bank meetings, we had good reason to believe that open
                                pressure <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0173"/>from the U.S. on
                                the French might lead them to think that political questions could
                                be successfully interjected.</p>
                            <p>In London on Wednesday the British asked us what the French had said
                                on this subject and we gave them the essence of Giscard d'Estaing's
                                remarks. They observed that the whole affair was mysterious. The
                                same view was expressed by the French officials the following day.
                                We conclude that the full scope of the discussions between Giscard
                                d'Estaing and Maudling may not be known even to their most trusted
                                subordinates.</p>

                                met in Washington on September —— together with Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JP5">Per Jacobsson</persName>, Managing Director of
                                the Fund.</p>
                            <p>Since not all of the countries concerned have as yet concluded
                                ratification, this meeting was of an informal character. Under the
                                Agreement of December 1961, the French Finance Minister is
                                responsible for arrangements between signature and the first formal
                                meeting of the group. Accordingly M. Valery Giscard d'Estaing served
                                as chairman.</p>
                            <p>The Ministers reviewed the development of the international monetary
                                situation over the past year and the prospects for the future. They
                                    <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0174"/>also discussed the
                                international cooperative arrangements which are being brought into
                                being to meet the developing monetary needs of the new era of
                                convertible currencies and progressively freer international
                                trade.</p>
                            <p>The Ministers were encouraged by the progress which has been made
                                during the past year towards a better basic balance in international
                                payments as a result of the measures already adopted in both deficit
                                and surplus countries. They affirmed the objectives of reaching a
                                balance at high levels of economic activity and by methods
                                consistent with vigorous economic growth. While speculative and
                                other short-term capital movements require continuing scrutiny, the
                                means for coping with such movements have been reinforced in a
                                number of ways and the ten Ministers agreed that these means would
                                be used as necessary.</p>
                            <p>In this connection the Ministers emphasized the importance of the new
                                arrangements for supplementing the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                    >IMF</gloss> through the addition of $6 billion of further
                                resources and stressed that these resources would be available for
                                decisive and prompt action. They also noted that various techniques
                                of cooperation are being developed among monetary author-ities of
                                the various countries in order to facilitate the functioning of the
                                international payments system and thereby to further the objectives
                                of the Fund. The additional resources thus provided, together with
                                world reserves and the existing resources of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, are large enough to assure a
                                stable exchange rate system and the maintenance of the existing
                                price of gold.</p>
                            <p>The Ministers agreed that continuing study of the means for further
                                improving the international monetary system in the years ahead was
                                desirable.</p>
                            <p>The Ministers considered that these discussions were very useful and
                                they agreed that similar meetings should be held from time to
                                time.</p>

                                and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. The main idea of
                                having this luncheon was to talk to these people personally about
                                the underlying cause of the deficit in our balance of payments,
                                namely, our disproportionate share of the defense and aid burdens
                                for the whole free world. These people have heard the song before
                                but never in a way which would give them a real feeling of how
                                central it is to your thinking. This is something that you can

                                represent the nine contributing countries other than ourselves,
                                direct expression of U.S. appreciation is appropriate. You may want
                                to say something here about the question of further developments in
                                the international monetary field, in addition to what is in your
                                speech. If you do, it could be along the lines of recognition that
                                the expanded economic strength of other countries in the Free World
                                could properly be reflected in their expanded role in the
                                international monetary system. We recognize the fact that there is
                                more than one way the system might evolve in relation to the central
                                role of the dollar, and we do not foreclose consideration of
                                alternative schemes of improvement for the payments system. (Note:
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> would not
                                welcome such a statement. It would mean your taking a public
                                position on the issue of whether we are or are not committed to
                                maintain the dollar as a major international currency in the
                                long-run.)</item>

                            <item>A few figures. Our deficit last year was $2.5 billion. This year,
                                as <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> will have said in
                                his bank speech, we expect it to be somewhere in <pb n="150"

                                Set against this a net military expenditure abroad (after receipts
                                from military sales and other offsets) of $2 billion, and untied aid
                                expenditures which have been running over $1 billion, which we hope
                                to get down below $1 billion this year. Thus, more than the whole of

                            <item>It is worth noting that our military expenditures involve gross

                                these payments are in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area
                                where all your auditors, except the Japanese, come from. The Swedes,
                                although neutral, are just as much beneficiaries of these
                                expenditures as the members of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> Alliance and they know it. By comparison, <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members undertake very little in
                                the way of foreign military expenditures except for the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, other than those connected with
                                offset purchase arrangements with us. We will try to reduce these
                                expenditures to the extent that they do not impair the common
                                security. However, we cannot reduce them substantially unless
                                someone else picks up more of the burden. This is especially true in
                                the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area. At Tab 2 are
                                attached estimates of the military budgets of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries and the portion
                                reflecting foreign expenditures by them. The only substantial
                                figure, besides that of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, is
                                the German, and that reflects chiefly the military sales agreement
                                with us. Also attached are the figures that Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> gave to General <persName

                                strength and expenditures at your suggestion. These figures do not
                                of course reflect the substantial internal burden of our defense
                                costs, which are likewise high in relation to those of our
                                allies.</item>

                            <item><p>The European countries tend to be more critical of our aid
                                    expend-itures than of our military expenditures. Sometimes they
                                    have viewed them as reflecting American notions which are not
                                    really their concern. It is important to make the point that aid
                                    expenditures are security expend-itures in behalf of the free
                                    world just as much as military expenditures are. There may well
                                    be differences of view about transactions with particular
                                    countries and criticism has tended to focus on these, but by and
                                    large the rest of the world is recognizing that aid is in their,
                                    as well as our, security interest and begin to join in bearing
                                    the burdens. They have understandably in the last years focussed
                                    their efforts on their own reconstruction and their own economic
                                    progress. Now that they are making such striking success even
                                    though we have tied their aid for a year, we are still more
                                    liberal in this respect than any other donor. The $1 billion of
                                    untied aid that we continue to give out of our total aid budget
                                    of nearly $5 billion is larger absolutely and proportionately
                                    than the untied aid of other national donors combined, excluding
                                    the International Bank and affiliated institutions.</p>
                                <p>Further, in the 2-1/2 years since our governments agreed to
                                    increase capital flow to the less-developed countries through
                                        <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> (of which <pb n="151"
                                        xml:id="pg_151" facs="0177"/>Sweden is not a member),
                                    although the total flow has increased, the share of the U.S. has
                                    increased rather than decreased.</p>
                                <p>The Europeans sometimes view aid as merely trade promotion. This
                                    is more true of their aid than it is of ours, since most of
                                    their aid loans are for short-terms at high rates. In these
                                    circumstances we cannot continue to extend long-term, low-rate
                                    loans, since in effect our aid is merely used to repay their
                                    loans. It is important for this to be recognized and for the
                                    terms of their loans to move closer to ours. In rejecting the
                                    notion that our aid is merely trade promotion, you might point
                                    out that we have a substantial export surplus on commercial
                                    account, excluding any <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-
                                    financed exports. It was about $3 billion last year.</p></item>

                            <item>We have borne the burden because we think it is in the interest of
                                free world security; we know that our own security is intimately
                                tied up with that of other major nations in the free world but they
                                must recognize the converse relation. They must remember that during
                                the period when they were unable to make any contribution we
                                willingly carried the whole load alone. Just with respect to the six
                                common market countries and the UK, we have extended in the past a
                                total of $33 billion worth of foreign aid since 1946 (see Tab 3,
                                which breaks these figures down by categories and countries). (It is
                                worth noting that since more than half the aid was extended before
                                1950 when prices were substantially lower than they are now, this
                                total would be more than $40 billion in current prices.) In addition
                                to this sum, we have disbursed a larger amount (about $55 billion)
                                to the rest of the world over the same time period. We do not remind
                                others of this in order to earn their gratitude, but simply to point
                                out that we bore the responsibility when we could, and if others do
                                not join when they can and we no longer can do it all, our common
                                security will be impaired.</item>

                            <item>The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that while both
                                continued strong effort by the U.S. directed at reducing unnecessary
                                overseas expenditures by the government and promoting exports and
                                further strengthening the international payments machinery in train
                                the problem of the U.S. balance of payments reflects fundamentally
                                the problem of political responsibility in the free world and cannot
                                be considered independent of that problem.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>As I informed Mr. Sorensen, I feel strongly that any reference in your
                            speech to our readiness to discuss new initiatives in the monetary field
                            would be most dangerous for the dollar at the present juncture. This is
                            not a question of substance but one of psychology. At the invitation of
                            Giscard d'Estaing, we have agreed to meet confidentially in Paris during
                            October with the French, the British, the Germans, and possibly the
                            Italians, in order to examine the possibilities for further cooperative
                            steps.</p>
                        <p>My reasons for recommending against any mention of our willingness to
                            study new proposals are two-fold: First, the general theme of the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> meeting, very effectively expounded by
                            Per <persName corresp="#p_JP5">Jacobsson</persName> in his opening
                            address, is that the present international monetary structure is strong
                            and capable of weathering any shocks. This line will be taken by
                            everyone, except for the British, and will be just the opposite of the
                            situation last year at Vienna when talk was necessarily centered on the
                            need to strengthen international monetary institutions because of the
                            weakness of the dollar. Since the British are the only ones indicating
                            the need for further steps at this time, your statement could be
                            misinterpreted as indicating a measure of support for the British
                            proposals. Our analysis of these proposals is that they are extremely
                            dangerous for the dollar. This view is shared by those continental
                            European officials to whom the British have confided the general
                            outlines of their scheme. In short, it seems to us that the British
                            proposals fit in very well with the constant, long-term effort by the
                            United Kingdom to undermine the dollar and force its eventual
                            devaluation. For this reason, we should clearly not appear to support
                            Maudling's ideas.</p>
                        <p>My second objection relates to the immediate future. A statement by you
                            that we are prepared to study new ideas and welcome new initiatives
                            would in all probability be misinterpreted by the speculative community
                            in New York and Switzerland as indicating a lack of confidence on your
                            part in our ability to handle our balance of payments problem within the
                            framework of the existing monetary system. This could have <pb n="153"
                                xml:id="pg_153" facs="0179"/>dangerous and immediate effects this
                            fall. If such a public statement by you should be interpreted in this
                            way, it could well lead to a further run on the dollar similar to those
                            that took place last October and November after the Vienna meeting, and
                            last July after the Canadian crisis. The experience of these two
                            incidents indicates that such runs bring with them the loss of $250
                            million or more in gold.</p>
                        <p>The best we could hope for if a statement regarding our readiness to
                            study new initiatives were included in your speech would be that it be
                            looked on as an innocuous statement of readiness to consider any serious
                            proposals put forward by others which naturally would always apply to
                            the United States in its international relations. If this should be the
                            interpretation put on the statement, it would do no harm, but neither
                            would it accomplish anything, since there are no proposals being talked
                            of except for those put forward by the British. On the contrary, if it
                            were taken as a serious desire on our part to explore further new
                            approaches at this time, it would carry with it all the dangers
                            mentioned above. For this reason, I strongly urge that you omit any such
                            statement from your speech.</p>

                            to increase its resources.” Most of his address emphasized the
                            importance of the dollar as an international currency and the U.S.
                            efforts, including bringing its international payments into balance, to

                                    balance-of-payments position, see <ref target="#d33fn11"

                        </list>
                        <p>On the basis of very early indications, our over-all payments deficit
                            increased very substantially in October, by about $900 million, of which
                            $56 million represented gold losses.</p>
                        <p>This very large deficit, without seasonal adjustment, is in sharp
                            contrast to the third quarter deficit of about $725 million, and to the
                            deficit for the first nine months of the year of $1.5 billion, without
                            any seasonal adjustment. Debt prepayments in the first nine months were
                            about $550 million, with most of this in the third quarter.</p>
                        <p>These unusually large figures in October are believed to be due primarily
                            to transactions with Canada which may have accounted for as much as $600
                            million of the October deficit. The figures reflect special fiscal
                            year-end window dressing operations by the Canadian banks of which about
                            $180 million returned to the U.S. during the first week of November.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0181"/>
                        <p>It has been estimated that the Canadians lost about $600 million to the
                            United States in the first half of the year. About $400 million of this
                            was reversed in the third quarter. It is likely that the bulk if not all
                            of the remainder of the earlier loss was reversed during October.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian government also borrowed $125 million during the month from
                            U.S. insurance companies on a long term basis and apparently attracted
                            some short-term capital from the U.S. for investment purposes.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this strengthened position, Canada yesterday reduced her
                            Bank rate from 5% to 4%. It had been raised as high as 6% at the time of
                            the currency crisis last June. This action should be helpful in reducing
                            the incentive for short-term flows to Canada.</p>
                        <p>Other major transactions in October, outside of Canada, included the
                            following: an increase of about $100 million in the official reserves of
                            France and Italy, payments of $75 to $100 million to Venezuela for taxes
                            and royalties by U.S. oil companies, a cash subscription of $30 million
                            from the U.S. Government to the Inter-American Development Bank, sales
                            of about $20 million in Australian bonds to American purchasers, and
                            approximately $30 million movement of short term funds to the United
                            Kingdom in the last few days of October.</p>
                        <p>Estimates of the basic deficit for the third quarter will not become
                            available for several weeks. During the first half of the year, the
                            basic deficit was less than $300 million, seasonally adjusted.</p>
                        <p>From January 1 through November 7, we now estimate the over-all deficit,
                            without seasonal adjustment, at about $2.1 billion. Last year it was
                            $2.5 billion for the full year. During the remainder of the year we
                            should receive a payment of almost $125 million on the British loan. We
                            expect the deficit to be reduced another $75 million by special
                            borrowing operations with Switzerland and Italy. On the unfavorable
                            side, there may be window dressing operations by the European banks at
                            the end of December which may result in some temporary capital outflow
                            of an extremely short-term character.</p>
                        <p>These figures indicate the importance of our receiving before the end of
                            the year the German payments of $225 million due us for military
                            equipment under the terms of the Strauss-<persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> agreement,<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2"

                            improvement over the figure for the previous year. As you know this
                            payment is now doubtful because of the recent German defense budget
                            cutbacks.</p>

                        <head>64. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>During Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>'s visit
                            to Washington November 14 and 15, 1962, he held several meetings with
                            U.S. Government officials. At the second meeting with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> on the afternoon of
                            November 14, the two discussed the French situation and the U.S. balance
                            of payments: “The situation in France had really been desperate until De
                            Gaulle took over and if he had not come in when he did, there was real
                            danger of a true civil war.</p>
                        <p>"The President stated that this problem was related to another one which
                            he wished to discuss with the Chancellor. This was the matter of our
                            dollar balance, which of course always affects the burdens we are
                            carrying overseas. Under no circumstances did we want to retrench in our
                            overseas defense efforts, which were costing us about $3 billion
                            annually. (The Chancellor expressed surprise that it was so little. He
                            had thought it would be considerably more.) For this reason the United
                            States greatly appreciated the Strauss/<persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> arrangement whereby German orders would be
                            placed in the United States in the amount of $250 million per year.
                            Since our difficulties in October we had had to draw on our dollar
                            resources even more and had since then heard the disquieting rumor that
                            for budgetary reasons the Federal Republic was expecting not to fulfill
                            this agreement this year. This would mean that our deficit would be that
                            much higher this year and this would have a very bad psychological
                            effect. The President hoped that Germany could see its way to making the
                            purchases as anticipated.</p>
                        <p>"The Chancellor indicated that he was not informed in this matter and
                            that he would look into it on his return. He would do everything in his
                            power to see that Germany's promise was kept.</p>
                        <p>"The President stated that we were appreciative of the aid extended so
                            far in this respect by the Federal Republic, for instance their
                            percentage of dollar holdings. It was important that our deficit did not
                            go up over last year. If it remained the same, it was tolerable, but if
                            it increased it constituted a worsening of the situation. He had heard
                            that Germany expected to make up next year what they would not be buying
                            this year but it would be better if it were done this year. The
                            President then stated that he would like to give the Chancellor a
                            one-page memorandum on this matter to take home with him.” (Memorandum

                        <p>Following his greeting to the Foreign Minister, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> remarked that the President had
                            spoken yesterday about the necessity for a larger German defense budget
                            and about the importance we place on the agreements for logistics
                            cooperation which had been concluded by our respective defense
                            ministries in the form of the Strauss-<persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> understandings. He noted the importance of
                            fulfilling these agreements for the benefit of both countries and the
                            Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that with
                            respect to these agreements for military cooperation he could only
                            respond as the Chancellor had done to the President. Neither the
                            Chancellor nor he knew the details of the problems which had arisen.
                            However, they promised to look into the matter immediately upon their
                            return. He noted that the Chancellor had said he would do everything in
                            his power to arrive at a proper solution. Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he could only reaffirm,
                            as had the Chancellor, that they did not intend to withdraw from
                            commitments that may have been made. He noted that the short memorandum
                            on the problem which the President had offered to provide to the
                            Chancellor today should greatly facilitate following up on the matter
                            when they returned. In the meantime, he would appreciate it if the
                            Secretary would give him more details on the problem and possible
                            solutions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that these
                            arrangements for military cooperation had become even more valuable than
                            we had realized at the time the agreements were reached about a year
                            ago. By these agreements the supply <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158"
                                facs="0184"/>systems of our two countries had been joined in a way
                            which made them more effective and cheaper to operate than if we
                            duplicated our efforts. For example, the U.S. had made available U.S.
                            Army training areas and had allotted 50% of the U.S. Air Force total
                            training time in the Federal Republic to the German Air Force. Since the
                            U.S. produces great quantities of the most modern military equipment, we
                            have been in a position to sell this equipment to Germany more cheaply
                            than alternative sources. In addition, we have given high priority to
                            deliveries to Germany and have indicated our willingness to make changes
                            in equipment to meet German needs. The problem that has arisen concerns
                            $300 million of payments that were to be made by Germany for such
                            equipment during the second half of this year. We have been informed
                            that because of cut-backs in the German defense budget about two-thirds
                            of this sum is not to be paid on schedule.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> inquired whether
                            the payments due were for deliveries that have actually been made or
                            whether there has been a slow-down of U.S. deliveries and therefore a
                            corresponding slow-down in payments.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> responded that
                            the payments we expect are for services we have performed according to
                            the agreements, but that the German defense budget levels prevent
                            payment.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he was
                            surprised to encounter this problem in Washington, since he had not
                            heard about it before he left and he was not familiar with arguments on
                            the German side.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the
                            German Defense Ministry tells us they simply have no money. However, he
                            wanted Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> to
                            understand that there was no disagreement between our defense ministries
                            on the terms of the basic understandings. It was merely that the
                            expected and agreed payments appear now not to be forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he was
                            surprised that the problem stemmed from a shortage in the 1962 budget.
                            He would have supposed that the Defense Ministry could not have ordered
                            more than that for which it could actually make payments. If it were the
                            1963 budget he could understand there might be a problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> commented that
                            perhaps the Defense Ministry expected an extra appropriation for the
                            1962 budget. He referred Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> to Herr Schiffers in the Defense Ministry as
                            the man who is familiar with this defense budget problem.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> wondered how the
                            Finance Minister would allow the Defense Ministry to over-commit itself,
                            and he presumed that Secretary Dillon would not allow the U.S. Defense
                            Department to become engaged in commitments which we could not pay.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> noted that the

                        <p>We must expect further substantial gold losses over the next few months.
                            The certainty of such losses is related mainly to our continuing heavy
                            balance of payments deficit rather than to hoarding and speculation. In
                            fact, the London gold market has been quiescent since November and the
                            central bank consortium has been a net buyer of gold. At best, however,
                            these purchases are not likely to exceed $70-80 million per month, of
                            which the U.S. share would be one-half. Meanwhile, foreign countries
                            that are gaining dollars over and above working balances or normal
                            holdings are planning to take gold from us.</p>
                        <p>The U.K. and the entire sterling area are in a seasonal period of
                            surplus, which the British expect to total, very roughly, about $400
                            million in <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0186"/>the first six months
                            of 1963. The Federal Reserve has been negotiating for an increase to
                            $250 million (from $50 million) in the mutual swap facility with the
                            Bank of England. If these negotiations are successful, the full credit
                            is likely to be used to absorb the U.K. accruals temporarily, pending a
                            possible seasonal reversal of the payments flow in the fall. The British
                            want the remaining $150 million in gold, however, of which they are
                            taking $50 million today.</p>
                        <p>France is still running large surpluses, which may total close to $1.2
                            billion for the year. The French will probably use half this amount for
                            debt prepayments. Of the remainder, about three-fourths will be
                            converted into gold since the French aim at a 75-percent gold ratio in
                            their reserves. If the French do no more than to keep up their regular
                            monthly purchases of $34 million ($204 million in the first six months
                            of the year), their gold ratio will actually decline slightly.</p>
                        <p>Spain's rate of reserve gains has slowed, but the Spaniards wish to raise
                            their gold holdings to $600 million from $480 million—i.e., to about
                            one-half the $1.2 billion in reserves they expect to reach by mid-year.
                            Consequently, they have asked for $20 million a month for six months
                            starting in January. The latest Spanish demand is ostensibly related to
                            the fact that the British have withdrawn an exchange guarantee on
                            Spain's holdings of sterling. Therefore, the Spaniards will convert some
                            of their sterling into dollars to buy the gold so that we will probably
                            lose somewhat less gold to the British than we otherwise might.</p>
                        <p>An Austrian gold purchase of $50 million was postponed late last year
                            through use of a Federal Reserve swap of that amount with the Austrian
                            National Bank, but since there has been no turnaround in their balance
                            of payments, we must expect them to run off the swap and purchase gold
                            early in 1963. The Austrians have a steady payments surplus and wish to
                            hold 50 percent of their reserves in gold. They are well below that
                            ratio now.</p>
                        <p>These prospective gold purchases total roughly $525 million for the first
                            half of the year. While we might very optimistically hope to recoup as
                            much as $200 million from the London gold market and other sources over
                            this period, any renewal of uncertainties and fears could greatly reduce
                            this figure. Moreover, the gold demands of the U.K., France, Spain and
                            Austria may be augmented by those of other countries, although we think
                            we have a fairly good basis for gauging the bulk of the
                            first-half-of-1963 demands.</p>
                        <p>The situation underscores the crucial importance of using as intensively
                            as possible all appropriate methods to curb the balance of payments
                            deficit.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The full-page table, entitled “Official Gold and Dollar Holdings of
                            Selected Countries in Relation to Their Foreign Trade and Their Total
                            Payment Obligations in 1961,” is in the Supplement.</p>
                        <p>In confronting the balance of payments problem I thought it might be
                            interesting for you to see the reserve figures of the various nations
                            set out in the form of the attached table.1</p>
                        <p>The last two columns show that, relative to our current trade and
                            payments obligations, our gold reserve is still relatively large. Except
                            for the Swiss, we lead the field.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, we face the two familiar limitations: <list>
                                <item>—Our $12 billion domestic gold cover;</item>
                                <item>—The burdens of maintaining the dollar as a unique reserve
                                    currency which leaves us vulnerable to sudden withdrawals;
                                    (although the French holdings should not frighten us, if we have
                                    a reasonable contingency plan, which is not all that
                                    difficult).</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>My reflection on this table is that we are in a position to sweat out a
                            somewhat longer basic adjustment in our balance of payments position
                            than envisaged some months ago if two conditions are satisfied: the
                            lifting of the domestic gold cover; and the early bilateral negotiation
                            with key European countries (and perhaps Japan) of arrangements for them
                            to hold dollars on longer term (say, in ten year bonds) with an exchange
                            guarantee and with the understanding that we would reciprocate when
                            their balance of payments were under strain. In effect, such
                            arrangements would fund a large portion of our outstanding short-term
                            dollar obligations and spread the burden of maintaining a reserve
                            currency to supplement inadequate world gold supplies. This method would
                            simply be an extension in the trend of Treasury policy; but it is urgent
                            for three reasons.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, we cannot mount the kind of European policy most of us now
                                envisage until the ground is under our feet on balance of payments,
                                and we can separate our policy towards conventional forces from our
                                balance of payments strain.</item>
                            <item>Second, it is difficult to envisage acceptance of the
                                across-the-board tariff cuts Herter aims to negotiate unless we have
                                an environment of relatively <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0188"
                                />full employment at home; and this also requires relief from
                                balance of payments pressure.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Finally, we may have difficulty with the tax bill if, in the face of
                            continued balance of payments deficits, and no offset arrangements,
                            anxiety should develop that prosperity via the tax cut would make our
                            balance of payments situation worse.</p>
                        <p>If another converging argument is needed, the balance of payments is
                            likely to haunt us—among other things—in a foreign aid battle this year
                            that will be adequately tough without its heavy shadow.</p>
                        <p>I conclude that a balance of payments move of the kind I suggest here is
                            now of the utmost urgency; and that we would undertake it from a
                            position of greater initial reserve strength than we often grant
                            ourselves.</p>

                        <p>You have asked for my thoughts on <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt
                                Rostow</persName>'s memorandum of February 4 on the balance of

                                    67</ref>.</note> He takes the position that our gold situation
                            is relatively good compared to other countries and that we need not
                            worry about running further larger balance of payments deficits provided
                            we first repeal the 25% gold cover law and negotiate substantial ten
                            year borrowings from our European creditors.</p>
                        <p>First, as to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s two
                            specific suggestions: You are aware that we all would favor repeal of
                            the 25% gold cover law. However, when Congressman Multer floated a trial
                            balloon on this subject during the last session of Congress, it became
                            obvious that there was intense and emotional conservative opposition to
                            repeal. It is highly doubtful if we could muster a majority, and, in any
                            event, the debate that would ensue would be seriously damaging to
                            international confidence in the dollar. Therefore, we have decided not
                            to press this issue until public opinion shifts or until our gold stock
                            actually drops below the ceiling. As you know, the Federal Reserve can
                            waive the ceiling under certain conditions, and Mr.
                                <persName>Martin</persName>
                            <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0189"/>has stated that he would
                            utilize this authority if it ever should prove necessary. The waiver
                            provisions are relatively innocuous until our gold supply drops to $6
                            billion—the 25% ceiling would be pierced at about $12 billion.
                            Thereafter, the waiver provisions are so onerous as to be impractical.
                            However, there would be plenty of time to obtain repeal after our gold
                            stock reached $12 billion. Our decision, therefore, has been not to
                            precipitate this unnecessary fight at this time.</p>
                        <p>As to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s suggestion of
                            ten year borrowings in Europe, it is simply an extension and
                            amplification of a new technique originated by the Treasury last year.
                            Loans of over one year duration are not counted as liquid liabilities
                            and thus have the effect of reducing our balance of payments deficit.
                            Last year we negotiated $250 million of 15 month loans with Italy and
                            Switzerland, which relieved our balance of payments to that extent. We
                            have recently concluded a similar borrowing with Germany which runs out
                            as far as two years, but with a shorter term option which the Germans
                            can use in case of need. This technique has proved useful, and we intend
                            to develop it further. However, any sudden campaign such as Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> proposes would be
                            doomed to failure.</p>
                        <p>Most foreign central banks are prohibited by law from making long term
                            loans, and, as a result, our borrowings are generally convertible into
                            90 day notes upon demand. While we may gradually extend the length of
                            our borrowings, it is perfectly clear that the Europeans would not agree
                            to any large scale stretch out of our present demand liabilities to a
                            ten year term. The dollar, after all, as a key currency, is part of
                            these countries' liquid reserves. A ten year loan would be far from
                            liquid and could not be counted as a reserve.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s proposal would put us
                            in a position similar to Brazil or Argentina, who, when they cannot pay
                            their debts, go to their creditors and get an agreement to stretch out
                            the debt over a period, usually not longer than five years. In sum,
                            while the Treasury initiative in this area has been successful and can
                            and will be carried further, it is not susceptible of being expanded
                            upon to the extent desired by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                                >Rostow</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>
                            has already scheduled meetings in five countries during the first week
                            in March at which he will be exploring current prospects.</p>
                        <p>Finally and most important, a word about the philosophy that lies behind
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s memorandum. This
                            philosophy is the natural reaction of those who find their preferred
                            policies threatened by balance of payments difficulties. It is only
                            natural that they search for ways to make this very real problem go away
                            without interfering with their own project, be they extra low interest
                            rates in the U.S. or the maintenance of large U.S. forces in Europe.</p>
                        <p>However, such individuals are asking the impossible. The sine qua non of
                            all international monetary dealings, under whatever system may be
                            imagined, is that no country can consistently run a large balance of <pb
                                n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0190"/>payments deficit. Under Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s program we would
                            consolidate our present liquid liabilities into ten year loans and then
                            promptly create new short-term liabilities to take their place. This
                            will not be accepted by our European friends, and cannot be accepted by
                            them if the dollar is to maintain its position as the world's reserve
                            currency.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to know when the time will come when
                            our credit will be exhausted. If we continue as at present that time
                            will surely come, although I do not believe it is at all imminent. In
                            this judgment, I agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                                >Rostow</persName> that our position is basically stronger than many
                            of our financial experts think. But, granting this, we must, by one
                            means or another, put our balance of payments house in order—and the
                            sooner the better—since time is now working against us. We simply cannot
                            ignore the basic disciplines of the balance of payments except at our
                            peril.</p>
                        <p>One final word as to the “burden” of supporting a key currency. The
                            burden is that we must maintain the value of our currency and cannot
                            allow it to be devalued as if we were Brazil, Canada or Argentina. But
                            the benefits are also great. To date, foreign countries and their
                            nationals have acquired nearly $20 billion in dollar accounts. This, in
                            effect, is a demand loan to us of $20 billion which has allowed us to
                            pursue policies over the years that would have been utterly impossible
                            had not the dollar been a key currency. Our dollar liabilities increased
                            by $1-1/4 billion last year alone, which also would have been impossible
                            were it not for the reserve currency status of the dollar. So while a
                            reserve currency has its special problems it also brings in its trail
                            real and important benefits.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dean</hi>: I have read your letter of February
                            25 to Ros Gilpatric about the Japanese offset negotiations<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d69fn1">This letter is scheduled for publication in <ref
                                    target="frus1961-63v22">volume XXII</ref>.</note> and am
                            somewhat concerned about certain points in it.</p>
                        <p>If I correctly interpret the last paragraph of your letter, it implies a
                            direct link between the level of U.S. military expenditures in Japan and
                            Japan's remaining “a highly favorable market for U.S. civilian exports.”
                            While any such direct link might be possible under a bilateral trade
                            arrangement it would be contrary to the principle of multilateral trade
                            and payments which we have all sought so strenuously to foster and which
                            is the foundation of our entire international trade and financial
                            policy. There is, of course, no question of the over-all adequacy of
                            Japan's foreign currency earnings.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the experience of recent years indicates that reductions in
                            U.S. military spending have not hindered the growth of U.S. commercial
                            exports to Japan. Since 1953 our military expenditures in Japan have
                            declined by more than half (from $725 to $350 million) while our
                            commercial exports have more than doubled (from $681 to $1,413
                            million).</p>
                        <p>The fact that U.S. commercial exports to Japan normally exceed our
                            imports is sometimes cited as a reason why we should not try to reduce
                            our expenditures in Japan. However, we have in the past always stood by
                            the position that it would not be proper to concentrate on one
                            item—merchandise trade—without considering the other items in our trade
                            and payments which are highly favorable to Japan and which more than
                            cover Japan's trade deficit with us. On merchandise trade alone the U.S.
                            sells more than it buys not only to Japan but also to Germany, Italy,
                            Spain and France (the other nations where we have sought offsets), and
                            in fact to most industrial nations. If we were to limit our balance of
                            payments corrective actions to nations where we do not have a trade
                            surplus, we would eliminate from consideration most of the major
                            countries of the world.</p>
                        <p>Japan's balance of payments prospects give no cause for concern.
                            According to Embassy Tokyo's projections of last November 21
                                (A-738),<note n="2" xml:id="d69fn2">Not printed. (Department of

                            foreign exchange reserves over the three years 1963 through 1965 by
                            almost $1 billion, despite an estimated $70 million <pb n="166"
                                xml:id="pg_166" facs="0192"/>reduction in the level of U.S. military
                            spending. This increase of $1 billion is well in excess of the offset
                            targets which I discussed with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GRL1"
                                >Gilpatric</persName> last October ($100 million in 1963; $200
                            million in 1964; and $300 million in 1965).</p>
                        <p>I know you recognize the urgency of getting our more prosperous allies to
                            assume a more equitable share of the burden of Free World defense and
                            aid, and we are in agreement that the Japanese military effort is
                            inadequate. However, in considering military offsets and reductions in
                            Japan, I am concerned that we may be setting our sights too low and may
                            not be approaching the problem with sufficient urgency and
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>I would think that once the Joint Chiefs' analyses on possible reductions
                            in Japan are completed it might be useful to arrange a
                            State/Treas-ury/Defense meeting, possibly with the President, to
                            consider the offset negotiations and possible defense reductions, and to
                            get agreement on precisely what we should aim for and how we expect to
                            achieve it.</p>

                                economic assistance,” he went on to stress the equal importance of
                                greater trade liberalization by Japan. “The military area is
                                circumscribed by constraints,” he argued, “while the much larger
                                civilian sector offers considerably greater room for maneuver.”

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dean</hi>: You will recall that I mentioned to
                            you a few weeks ago my feeling that the Treasury could be of help to you
                            in your perennial effort to obtain more adequate defense contributions
                            from our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. As I pointed out,
                            it has seemed to me that part of the problem lies in the fact that the
                            Finance Ministers of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies
                            have been able to avoid all personal responsibility for the decisions
                            reached by their colleagues in charge of defense and foreign policy.
                            This leaves them free to actively oppose within their own governments
                            the appropriation of the funds required to meet agreed goals. This they
                            have not hesitated to do even though agreements by <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> national representatives are supposed
                            to be government commitments. Last fall's struggle in the German
                            Government was but the latest and clearest example of many such
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>It would appear to me that Stikker's current initative on military
                                planning<note n="1" xml:id="d70fn1">Documentation on <gloss

                            ways and means of tying the European Finance Ministers more closely into
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> decisions so that they will
                            feel responsible within their governments to provide the funds needed to
                            meet agreed force goals. As you know, this was the original thought
                            behind the practice of including Ministers of Finance in the December
                            Ministerial meetings. Since no substantive tasks have been assigned to
                            the Ministers of Finance at these meetings, their attendance has become
                            purely symbolic, and indeed some of the more important Ministers, i.e.,
                            the German Minister, seldom even bother to attend. I also feel that
                            unless we can find a way to make better use of the Finance Ministers,
                            serious consideration should be given to relieving them of the necessity
                            of attending these meetings.</p>
                        <p>Irrespective of your decision on this larger question, I believe that the
                            Treasury could be of substantial help to the Departments of State and
                            Defense in preparing the U.S. position on the capacity of our allies to
                            finance any given military program. I note that Stikker has proposed to,
                            “examine the financial and economic implications for member countries
                            collectively and individually of providing the forces called for in
                            MC26/4.” In particular, he has proposed to attempt to determine, “<pb
                                n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0194"/>whether member countries were
                            capable of a greater financial and economic effort in favor of defense
                            and were bearing an equitable share of the common defense burden.”</p>
                        <p>I am glad to know that we are supporting Stikker in this effort and
                            believe that the Treasury's resources can be of substantial help in
                            reaching our overall objective of bringing <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> strategy, forces and budgets into rational balance. In
                            particular, the Treasury should be able to help in the critical analysis
                            of the estimates of financial capabilities of individual <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries prepared by the
                            International Secretariat. In view of the importance of this matter in
                            our overall <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> objectives, political,
                            strategic and financial, as well as to our balance of payments, I am
                            taking the liberty of sending copies of this letter to Bob McNamara and
                            Mac Bundy.</p>

                                Murville</persName> met with U.S. officials on May 25, 1963. The
                            memorandum of his conversation with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> at the White House on May 25 at
                            11 a.m. begins as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"The President greeted the Foreign Minister and said he was glad
                                    to see him. He asked how things were going on in France. The
                                    Minister said the economic situation was generally favorable,
                                    but there was a danger of inflation. The government was taking
                                    certain measures such as limiting credit, increasing taxes, and
                                    liberalizing imports. The President stressed the importance the
                                    United States Government attaches to increasing the volume of
                                    trade. He said he thought so long as the interest rates and the
                                    costs of France and the United States remained relatively
                                    stable, we could look forward to such an increase. The Foreign
                                    Minister said he thought that the greatest need of the West was
                                    to have a sound monetary policy. This aspect of the common
                                    interest of the West was not being adequately discussed. The
                                    President agreed and said that matters of this sort tended to be
                                    treated too technically and to remain too much in <pb n="169"
                                        xml:id="pg_169" facs="0195"/>the hands of the bankers, who
                                    do not see them in terms of the national interest.</p>
                                <p>"The President then turned to the US balance of payments
                                    difficulties. He said that the United States would be short
                                    another $2.5 billion this year. The danger was not so much a
                                    matter of loss of dollars, as the possibility of a run on gold.
                                    This was our big problem. The President said that every time it
                                    was proposed that we take some steps to bring our payments into
                                    balance, we were exposed to loss of confidence in our currency
                                    which took the form of a run on the dollar. Couve asked whether
                                    the United States Government had ever considered changing the
                                    international price of gold. The President asked in turn whether
                                    this would not cause a run on the dollar. Couve said it would
                                    not, because everyone would have already agreed on the new price
                                    beforehand, and each currency would be pegged to it when it came
                                    into effect. He went on to say that he thought that the United
                                    States was dealing with the problem of the balance of payments
                                    piecemeal. The United States, he said, does not have a real
                                    deficit. It has a foreign trade surplus. He said he thought that
                                    tourists should be counted under trade. He said the real trouble
                                    was that there was too much export of US capital abroad. The
                                    President agreed that tourists are a form of trade. He pointed
                                    out that we lose $1.5 billion under this category in addition to
                                    our expenditures for military and foreign aid programs. Couve
                                    observed that tourists represented something more than trade,
                                    that they played an important political and psychological role
                                    in international relations.” (Department of State, Presidential

                            general area of economic relations, including such matters as monetary
                            policy, offset arrangements and the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round of trade negotiations. The President said
                            that these economic subjects were possibly even more important to us now
                            than nuclear matters. This was because our nuclear position was very
                            strong indeed and entirely adequate to discourage any attack on the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>The President said we would not wish to repeat the experience of the
                            1920's, which had had wide repercussions in Europe. If international
                            trade could be expanded, this would help bring prosperity both to the US
                            and to Europe. It was very important that the coming trade negotiations
                            be successful. While foreign trade was not inherently as important to us
                            as to the Europeans, it was nevertheless important in that it played a
                            key <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0197"/>role in enabling us to earn
                            enough to maintain our overseas commitments. The President hoped that
                            the coming negotiations could be conducted at the highest level. They
                            should involve heads of government and Foreign and Defense ministers,
                            and not just be left to technicians such as agricultural experts and
                            tariff commissioners. Unless we could maintain international liquidity
                            and a balanced trade situation, there would be difficulties which could
                            possibly lead to a collapse. For example, he added, had it not been for
                            the constructive role played at the Geneva trade talks by the Federal
                            German Government we would have had a breakdown there.</p>
                        <p>Continuing on this theme, the President said that in America, we lose
                            $1-1/2 billion a year in tourist trade alone. On the other side of the
                            coin, we send more agricultural products to Germany than the Germans
                            sell to us. What was needed was to look to the overall balance of
                            international trade and to make every effort to maintain this balance.
                            At the present time the US economy was in a strong position and the
                            dollar in good shape. The redistribution of assets internationally over
                            the past 10 years had been healthy. The President added: “We must
                            conduct these negotiations at the top level—otherwise we'll be ruined by
                            bookkeepers”.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said
                            that the German deficit in tourist trade was running around $700 million
                            a year. The President commented maybe we had better include Directors of
                            Tourism in our discussions. It was in any case important to get the
                            whole balance of trade out on the table. The French, Italians and
                            Spanish had favorable tourism balances. Our overall purpose was to
                            maintain general liquidity and upward movement in the economy on an
                            international scale in a balanced way.</p>
                        <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> entered the
                            discussion at this point. He said he wanted to tell the President that
                            the problems of the US in the field of trade and balance of payments
                            were well known to the Germans and they appreciated our concern. He
                            wished to stress, however, that this was not just a US problem but one
                            for the entire free world. Should the dollar encounter difficulties,
                            this would affect us all just as the solar system would be disrupted
                            were the sun no longer to stand still. In Germany, efforts had been made
                            to take our balance of payments problem into account. For example,
                            present German reserves totalled <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 29
                            billion, with a ratio of <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 15 billion in
                            gold and only <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 14 billion in US
                            dollars. This ratio was the most favorable to the US of all European
                            countries. The Germans did not wish to change this because they laid
                            great stake on their good relations with the US. They were constantly
                            seeking ways of strengthening international liquidity and making better
                            use of available resources. For example, the German Central Bank was
                            already taking steps to acquire US Treasury Bonds in large amounts. The
                            Germans were interested in strengthening not only the dollar but the
                            international economic <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0198"/>cohesion
                            of the free world. The Germans would do all they could so long as the
                            problem was bilateral in scope. Foreign trade was very important for the
                            Germans—it represented 15% of <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> as
                            contrasted with only 4% for the US—because it was so large a percentage
                            of the total effort and their own economy was more vulnerable. He felt
                            there was a complete identity of interest with us in this area.</p>
                        <p>Professor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> then said that one
                            of the big difficulties lay in the agricultural field. The German
                            Government had problems with its own farmers, who spoke with a loud
                            voice. He hoped the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> could grapple
                            with this problem before the end of the year. If they were not
                            successful, it would make the <persName>Kennedy</persName> Round more
                            difficult. He attached great importance to the success of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round. He thought his efforts
                            with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> in Geneva
                            had borne witness to this. Many other problems came to his mind in this
                            area, although some of them concerned US internal policies, such as
                            trade and financial policies, tax policies, etc. Maybe he would have a
                            chance to discuss some of these with the President in Wiesbaden
                                tomorrow.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> spent most of June 25 with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> and others on a

                                the President's meetings with <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                    >Erhard</persName>, see the Supplement.</note> In such event he
                            hoped the President would consider him to be speaking not as German but
                            as an expert in the field of international economics.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed this might be useful. He cited the valuable
                            contributions the Germans had made in the past on such things as
                            military offset arrangements, general financial and monetary policy, the
                            Geneva <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations, preparations
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round, etc. He
                            had sometimes wondered why this was called the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round and why it should not be
                            called the <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> Round or the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> Round. But whatever
                            it was called, it must be a success. We needed the cooperation of all
                            countries, but the Federal Republic was in a particularly important
                            position. We had been glad to have the views of the Federal Republic and
                            would take them into account. The problems were considerable but it
                            would amount to a failure of will and nerves if we did not solve them
                            successfully.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor said he would like to add a word “as a layman but also as
                            a politician”. He agreed that these matters should be the responsibility
                            of the leading Ministers. This could cause some difficulties, however;
                            witness the fact that the French Foreign Minister always attended the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> meetings, and this sometimes had
                            the effect that other countries would listen more to him than to the
                            German technical experts. The Chancellor was not sure the President was
                            fully aware of the great difficulties the Germans were having with the
                            French in the field of agricultural <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173"
                                facs="0199"/>trade matters, particularly as concerned grain prices.
                            The French were producing more wheat than they needed and at a lower
                            price than the Germans because they had better soil and better weather.
                            There were problems with the German trade unions, where their boss was
                            not George Meany but Herr Brenner. The metal workers were a very big
                            union with a dominating position, and recent agreements on wages and
                            hours had affected German production. Coal was no longer the source of
                            wealth it had once been, and mining operations were expensive. The
                            Federal Government had to look to its future economic position with some
                            anxiety and ask whether it was going to be in a position to carry out
                            all of its obligations. The Germans wanted to do all they could in the
                            economic and agricultural fields and would work together for the common
                            good. After all, we were all threatened by the same adversary. But the
                            Germans had problems. The days of large German export balances were
                            gone. German exports were coming down close to imports and the German
                            trade balance was delicate. But the Germans had good will, which was an
                            asset which counted for much. The President could count on German good
                            will in the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round. But it
                            should be remembered that the Germans were not as rich as some people
                            believed.</p>
                        <p>The President said the Chancellor sounded like someone coming to a bank
                            for a loan. The Chancellor smilingly replied that if that were the case
                            he might talk differently.</p>
                        <p>The President said that a further difficulty was that we spent $200
                            million a year on bases in France, where there were no offset
                            arrangements. In France we had to earn our money somehow to maintain our
                            bases. The French Finance Minister should know better than to accuse us
                            of trying to dominate the French economy or trying to dump our goods
                            there. Exports were only a small percentage of our total products. Our
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> had increased from $500 billion
                            to $585 billion in recent months. We could lose $20 billion a year in
                            trade without hurting. Trade was important to us only in that it enabled
                            us to earn balances to carry out our world commitments and play a world
                            role.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said he wished to mention
                            other things which might be done to help the situation. The Germans had
                            revalued their currency not long ago, which had helped US exports to
                            Germany. It was important to maintain a stable price level. The problem
                            could not be solved by inflation of currencies all over Europe. He had
                            suggested to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> the
                            possibility of setting up world commodity agreements for cereals and
                            cattle as we had on coffee and cotton. It was important to work together
                            in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. We must open the doors wider
                            to international trade; this would require less manipulation of
                            currencies.</p>
                        <p>In essence, <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said, he had a
                            single request—for more open-mindedness on our part in developing
                            instrumentalities for handling international <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174"
                                facs="0200"/>trade and business—instrumentalities to control, direct
                            and supervise international economic development.</p>
                        <p>The President said he completely agreed. It was necessary however to make
                            a judgment as to which tools to use. He hoped to talk further with
                                <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> about this
                            tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President excused himself in view of the imminence of
                            his scheduled press conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d72fn3">For the

                        <p>The President opened by stating that he appreciated what <persName
                                corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> had done for trade and to help
                            Gov. <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> in Geneva. He then
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>'s ideas concerning
                            the balance of payments and monetary policy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> replied that he followed all
                            aspects of the U.S. trade balance closely. This trade balance was not
                            merely America's concern, in which case it would not be his business to
                            talk about it, but it was something of concern to the world monetary
                            order. A policy of defense spending and simultaneous tax reduction
                            seemed entirely appropriate provided the <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175"
                                facs="0201"/>two together served not merely to increase consumer
                            purchasing power but also had the effect of stimulating productive
                            investment. He had closely studied American tax reduction plans,
                            however, and had concluded that if they only encouraged consumer
                            spending, they would not speed economic growth.</p>
                        <p>There is a rather strange situation that runs contrary to traditional
                            economic views, Germany had an overboom, with a very lively market, a
                            surplus, and continuing activity. In the same situation the U.S. had
                            unemployment, a balance of payments deficit, and a good deal of unused
                            productive capacity. <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>
                            thought we should increase the discount and interest rates. Such an
                            increase need not at all paralyze investment activity, but would on the
                            contrary stimulate it. Low interest rates did not produce the effect
                            expected of them. His ideas about that and about monetary policy were
                            embodied in a bill that he would submit to the Bundestag. He also
                            stressed the need on the American side for a more active policy of
                            influencing the business cycle.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that last year there was a deficit of $2 billion. Now
                            it is cut by one-third, with investment down.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> thought there were some
                            devices which had not been used enough. He would have a discussion with
                            the president of the International Monetary Fund.
                                <persName>Erhard</persName> had proposed to him that nations should
                            draw on the mark and not only on the dollar. Wider use of the Fund's
                            facilities would be useful.</p>
                        <p>The President commended <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> for
                            his helpfulness in connection with the dollar balance. If everybody
                            wanted 100 percent gold cover, there just is not enough gold for that
                            around. Raising the rate for money had been considered, but we must
                            remember that when that was done before we got the recessions of 1958
                            and 1960. If we raise the rate now we might run into the same situation.
                            He thought the tax cut would get things on the move.</p>
                        <p>Vice Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> wondered
                            whether there were not certain powerful industrial and business
                            interests in the United States who deliberately manipulated the American
                            economy to perpetuate a high level of unemployment. Their rationale
                            could be that full employment in Germany having brought about a
                            situation where the labor unions pre-sented management with ever
                            increasing demands, a level of unemployment such as the present level in
                            the United States would keep American labor more tractable and keep
                            production costs favorable for export. The President dismissed such a
                            possibility by saying that these powerful industrial and business
                            interests were not “smart enough” to carry out such a deliberate
                            plan.</p>

                            <item>As long as US balance of payments remains a serious problem, our
                                military presence in Germany will be vulnerable to criticism and a
                                target for reduction, in absence of satisfactory offset arrangement
                                to compensate for US foreign exchange costs. I have stressed this in
                                all my talks with German officials, including Chancellor, von
                                Hassel, and <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>. Recent
                                negotiations in Washington and Bonn have revealed a disturbing lack
                                of understanding, among certain key officials in the Ministry
                                Defense, and others, of the importance of the offset arrangements to
                                a continuation of the present level of US military effort in

                            <item>Despite von Hassel's firm assurance last February, <gloss
                                    target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> has been unwilling to commit itself
                                to payments in excess of $1,000 million during US <gloss

                                Furthermore, they foresee payments of only about $100 million during
                                the second half of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1963. From the
                                standpoint of new orders, the prospect of reaching the target during
                                    <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>'s 1963 and 1964 ($1,300
                                million) is somewhat brighter. Thus far, however, we have only

                            <item>I believe Minister von Hassel, the Chancellor and other Cabinet
                                officers have a sincere desire to provide a full offset. They seem
                                to have a vague impression that an offset is feasible, and that it
                                will probably be achieved anyway without much effort on their part.
                                Actually, Germany is fairly close to being able to provide a full
                                offset for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>'s 1963 and 1964. The
                                main difficulty at present is in maintaining a steady flow of
                                payments during remainder of this year. This will require special
                                effort (perhaps an advance against the <gloss target="#t_CY1"
                                    >CY</gloss> 1964 defense budget), but with support of high
                                levels in the German Government, I believe it can be
                                accomplished.</item>

                                and others his recognition of the FedRep's very important
                                contribution to Allied security in increasing the defense budg-et

                                President might, at same time, stress importance of maintaining
                                momentum of the military buildup and his hope that Defense would
                                continue to receive a reasonable priority in the allocation of
                                budgetary funds. In our judgment, a feasible goal for 1964 would be

                                Rumors are circulating that Congress might amend proposal to make

                        <p>Dear Mr. Minister:</p>
                        <p>I have been deeply concerned by your letter of July 24, 1963,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d79fn2">Not found.</note> indicating that the proposed U.S.
                            interest equalization tax is expected to deal a severe blow to the
                            Japanese economy and requesting consideration of an exemption for
                            Japan.</p>
                        <p>May I say, first of all, that I regret having been unable to consult with
                            you about this measure before the public announcement was made but I am
                            sure you will appreciate that an action of this type, like a budgetary
                            proposal, which will have major impact on securities markets, cannot be
                            discussed in advance even with the closest of friends. In acting to
                            raise the cost to foreigners of long-term borrowing in the U.S. we were
                            following the advice of our colleagues in the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss>—which will soon include Japan—but the specific
                            technique was of our own development. This particular proposal was not
                            discussed in advance of its announcement with any other government and
                            indeed, the knowledge of the proposal was limited to a very few
                            individuals within my own government. It could not have been
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased that it has been possible for your representatives to
                            discuss in detail with Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RRV1"
                                >Roosa</persName> this week the probable effect of the proposed tax
                            on Japan. It has been most helpful to have these consulations before we
                            complete the drafting of the actual legislation which will be proposed
                            to the Congress. In this way we are able to give full consideration to
                            the views of the Government of Japan.</p>
                        <p>The President would not have proposed the introduction of an interest
                            equalization tax had it not become clear that the need for action to
                            reduce the outflow of long-term capital from the U.S. was urgent. The
                            initiation of direct capital controls would be contrary to our basic
                            precept of free markets and we could not take this route. A substantial
                            increase in our whole long-term interest rate structure, if such an
                            increase could practicably have been effected, would have thrown our
                            economy into reverse and damaged the economy of every free nation as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>In moving to reduce the outflow of capital we fully realized that our
                            action would have a significant impact on our friends abroad, but the
                            U.S. cannot eliminate its balance-of-payments deficit unless some of the
                            surpluses of our friends are also affected. I trust and am confident
                            that the leading industrial nations of the world including Japan will
                            understand the necessity for the action taken. I have already received
                            assurances from the leading Western European powers that the steps taken
                            last week including the tax proposal to strengthen the position of the
                            dollar are both understood and supported. They are prepared to make
                            adjustments just as we are having to make adjustments.</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>In recent years the general pattern of U.S.-Japanese economic
                            relationships has been such that Japan has had large net dollar earnings
                            from its trade and service transactions with the U.S., taken together,
                            and has used these dollars as well as the very large volume of dollars
                            borrowed from the U.S., short-term and long-term, to meet its deficits
                            with other areas of the world and to build its foreign exchange
                            reserves. This proc-ess, so necessary to Japan's progress and
                            development, has now helped to establish Japan in a position of
                            strength. This new situation warrants, as I am sure you will agree,
                            increasing reliance of Japan on other sources of capital as well.</p>
                        <p>We do not expect that our interest equalization tax will prevent Japanese
                            borrowing in our markets. Because of the wide difference between the
                            Japanese interest rate structure and the interest rates which Japan pays
                            on its borrowings in the United States, some part of the borrowings
                            previously contemplated by Japanese firms or the Japanese government
                            should still be practicable. Our markets remain completely open and
                            free. The only difference is an additional element of borrowing cost
                            that will deter some borrowers, but not all. This is why we feel certain
                            that any urgent Japanese needs can continue to be met.</p>
                        <p>The unusual exemption being considered for Canada should be understood in
                            these same terms. In effect, the Canadians, agreeing with us that the
                            volume of their borrowing here must be restrained, have undertaken to
                            bring about any changes in their own interest rate structure needed to
                            reduce the differentials between interest rates in their markets and
                            ours, and thereby deter Canadian borrowing here. The exemption we are
                            recommending for Canada relates only to new issues of Canadian
                            securities, not to the purchase by Americans of outstanding
                            securities—the latter will in any event remain subject to tax. This
                            unusual exemption is practicable only because of the unusually close
                            interrelationships between the Canadian capital markets and our own. The
                            significant result is that Canadian borrowing here will be substantially
                            reduced to the approximate levels characteristic of earlier years.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you will agree with me, regrettably, that the United States
                            must curtail the overall amounts borrowed in the long-term capital
                            markets here, at least for a time, if we are to restore equilibrium in
                            our payments position. It is because that restoration is essential for
                            the stability of the international monetary system that we have been
                            forced to introduce the proposed tax. Its effect will also be to
                            discourage as well many of the European borrowers who, at the time of
                            the President's announcement, were planning a substantial volume of
                            additional financing in the United States. But we will not be required
                            to choose among countries nor among borrowers. The tax method will
                            assert its effects through the market process, with an increase in the
                            comparative cost of borrowing here acting to reduce the amount that will
                            be borrowed.</p>
                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>My feeling, Mr. Minister, is that we must now keep a close watch on
                            developments. We will look forward to further discussions with your
                            representatives here on a continuing basis. I am particularly looking
                            forward to an opportunity of reviewing the entire situation with you
                            when you come to Washington at the time of the annual meeting of the
                            International Bank and Fund in September. No doubt we will have further
                            occasion to consult on the special economic problems in our own balance
                            of payments relationships at the time of the Joint Japan-United States
                            Cabinet Committee meeting in Tokyo in November. I suggest we plan on
                            that basis.</p>

                                >Telegram 374 from Bonn, July 27, claimed that the Joint Report,
                                which was signed on July 24 by representatives of the Department of
                                Defense and the German Defense Ministry and was to be signed by
                                German Defense Minister Kai-Uwe von Hassel and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> during the latter's visit
                                to Bonn July 31-August 2, was not clear whether the payments offset
                                during the next 2 years would be $1,300 million or $1,000 million.
                                The telegram expressed the fear that the German Government would
                                interpret the Joint Report as “U.S. acquiescence to <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> minimum payments schedule totaling
                                $1,000 million.” (Ibid.) The Joint Report has not been found.</note>
                            Re Part I Joint Report we agree that there should be no doubt that the
                            U.S. expects a full offset to U.S. defense expenditures in both payments
                            and orders. Therefore it is proposed that Secretary <persName

                            to Minister von Hassel to make it absolutely clear that we expect full
                            offset. This is in keeping with the past practice of exchanges with the

                        <p>The President said that he also wished to talk about troop reductions in
                                Europe.<note n="1" xml:id="d82fn1">For additional documentation on
                                decisions leading to troop reductions in Europe, see <ref
                                    target="#d26">Documents 26</ref> ff.</note> He noted that there
                            had been a problem arising from the withdrawal of 600 US troops from the
                            Berlin Garrison. He said that the US has very large forces abroad and an
                            extensive logistics line, which has been set up almost on a wartime
                            basis. The United States maintains around 300,000 men in Europe. The
                            President said that the US does not want to take actions which would
                            have an adverse impact on public opinion in Germany but does not wish to
                            keep spending money to maintain forces which are not of real value. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that these
                            reductions relate to non-combat units.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said that the
                            important thing is to have detailed talks in advance so that objectives
                            are made clear and public opinion can be clarified. Otherwise people in
                            Germany would think the US was reducing its forces as a result of some
                            arrangement between the US and the Soviet Union. The important thing is
                            to explain these matters in advance and to carry out the reductions at
                            an appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the US would discuss these matters with the
                            Federal Republic as the situation develops. In the case of US forces in
                            Germany, the President said the arguments against reductions at this
                            time are more powerful than the arguments in favor.</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0213"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said there are
                            positive aspects to these reductions. The US always maintains large
                            numbers of supporting units with its divisions. If some of these units
                            are withdrawn, this may have an effect on German performance. The
                            Foreign Minister repeated that the Federal Republic would be agreeable
                            to withdrawals if there were good preparation in advance.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that these reductions involve about 18,000 men,
                            largely in France, Britain and Spain. He emphasized that the US would
                            stay in close touch with the Federal Republic on this subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> stated that the
                            decisive point is that German public opinion should feel that there has
                            been frank consultation. He commented that Germany is a little different
                            perhaps in this respect. When the President went to Berlin, his
                            statements were of great importance and were well received. Nevertheless
                            the US is at some distance from Germany and the German people feel the
                            need for an “allowance” of goodwill and understanding.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood this point. He was glad that he had been
                            able to go to Germany to show the interest of the U.S. and our
                            understanding of the German situation. It is probably hard for the
                            German people to understand clearly some of the problems which the
                            United States considers of major importance, such as the race problem
                            and Cuba.</p>
                        <p>As the meeting broke up Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            said it had been a very unusual meeting since the subject of poultry had
                            not been discussed. The President emphasized his interest in an early
                            solution of the problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> said that he was very aware of this matter and
                            that the Federal Republic had been working for what it hoped would be a
                            solution of the problem of poultry levies.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended at 11:35 a.m.</p>

                            December and Senate would take action in January. The capital market
                            would then open with the one percent interest rate equivalent in tax

                            <item>Development of a clear concept of the rationale and purpose of US
                                external military aid programs has been hampered by a widespread
                                disposition to justify military aid primarily on grounds that it
                                should contribute—more or less directly—to strengthening the
                                military posture of the United States. Experience since World War
                                II, however, has shown that US military aid also serves a variety of
                                non-military purposes and that even the purely military returns vary
                                widely in nature and amount from country to country. This confusion
                                about the purpose of military aid and the impossibility of laying
                                down broad criteria applicable to a world-wide military aid program
                                has caused difficulty not only with Congress but in the formulation
                                and administration of military aid.</item>

                            <item>Military aid does and should serve a variety of purposes. The more
                                important ones are listed below and demonstrate clearly that (a)
                                many are non-military; (b) few if any have general application; most
                                are important in some areas and unimportant or inapplicable in
                                others; and (c) their importance in different areas changes with
                                changing military and political conditions. These variously valid

                            <item>One principle that is generally valid with regard to military aid
                                is that we should tailor the aid to serve, as well as possible, as
                                many as possible of the purposes that are valid at the particular
                                time and place. Thus for example even if an aid program is initiated
                                as quid pro quo for base rights, we should seek to have it serve
                                other constructive purposes, such as nation-building, not just
                                tickle the vanity of the recipients.</item>

                            <item>The problems with regard to administering military aid programs
                                for countries in category (a) are largely military ones once the
                                decision has been made regarding the desired level of indigenous
                                forces it is in the US interest to support. However, the decision
                                which places a given country in category (a) is not always a purely
                                military or strategic one. For example, Pakistan has been receiving
                                military assistance with the aim of building a force capable of
                                contributing to the defense of Pakistan against Bloc aggression. It
                                might well be asked, however, whether the limited contribution even
                                US-supported Pakistani forces could make toward coping with Bloc
                                aggression compensates for the drain on Pakistani resources which
                                could otherwise be devoted to economic development and for the
                                political problems US military aid to Pakistan has caused with India
                                and Afghanistan. In short, military criteria should not be the only

                                defined, is rapidly becoming a major problem for many non-<gloss

                                solution of the causes of internal security; hence the military
                                aspects of an aid program must be dovetailed with them, and often be
                                subordinate to them.</item>

                            <item>Finally, there are countries in category (c) which for a variety
                                of non-military reasons are receiving or should receive military

                                point of view, are not overriding or are subordinate to political
                                requirements, US military assistance programs should be geared
                                primarily to achieving US economic, social and political objectives
                                in a given country. These objectives will vary, of course, from
                                country to country, but in general this approach to military
                                assistance should make for greater efficiency in the use of military
                                aid, not only to improve internal security capabilities, but, for
                                example, to indoctrinate military personnel along lines favorable to
                                US interests and assist nation-building activities through the
                                construction of roads, harbors, etc., and the training of labor in

                                results politically as well as militarily, it will be necessary to
                                make some changes in the administrative arrangements under which
                                these programs are now formulated and implemented in order to
                                achieve closer cooperation between State and Defense. It is not
                                recommended that any type of new joint agency be established.
                                Indeed, despite the substantial and increasing political content of
                                military aid programs, primary responsibility for them should remain
                                with Defense. The desired goal could perhaps best be achieved by
                                assigning a few State officers to work on an integrated basis in
                                Defense. They would not be expected to speak officially for State or
                                to be a substitute for the liaison that now takes place at various
                                levels between State and Defense on military assistance programs.
                                Their primary contribution would be to bring their experience in
                                political and economic affairs to bear at an early stage on the
                                formulation and administration of military assistance programs, in a
                                way that is virtually impossible within existing bureaucratic
                                liaison machinery between the two Departments. Their participation
                                in the preparation and implementation of military assistance
                                programs would, at the very least, assure that political and
                                economic, as well as military, goals were being given constant and
                                fruitful attention.</item>

                        <p>In his memorandum of January 24,<note n="1" xml:id="d85fn1">In this
                                memorandum to department heads and agencies, the President explained
                                the centralization of government oversight of the movement of
                                agricultural commodities and products abroad under the Director of
                                the Food for Peace Program, who was directed “to exercise
                                affirmative leadership and continuous supervision over the various
                                activities in this field, so that they may be brought into
                                harmonious relationship.” Accompanying the memorandum was Executive
                                Order 10915, January 24, 1961, which provided the legal authority
                                for the Director's assumption of these additional coordinating
                                responsibilities. For text of the President's memorandum and

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> said he has asked the
                            Food-for-Peace Director to conduct an intensive review of uses of U.S.
                            agricultural products abroad and possible improvements in them.</p>
                        <p>Immediate attention should be given to focusing on the “food for
                            development” aspects of Food-for-Peace. This is the realistic focus for
                            advancing U.S. interests and also the interests of the impoverished
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Although “food for development” is already an integral part of the
                            President's general Food-for-Peace program, it seems to have been pushed
                            to the background by the idea of “helping provide a more adequate diet
                            for peoples all around the world.”<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">The
                                quotation is from the President's January 24 memorandum.</note> If
                            our program is too broad, it will arouse expectations abroad we cannot
                            fulfill, and seem unrealistic to our own people.</p>
                        <p>"Food for development,” however, is a promise we can readily fulfill. We
                                can<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">The word “can” has been inserted by

                            other people prepare to feed themselves better. What is involved can be
                            easily explained. For example, if we send steel rails and engineers to
                            help country <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0219"/>X build a
                            railroad, we also send enough wheat to feed and pay the wages of the
                            local workmen who clear the jungle and lay the rails.</p>
                        <p>This has been done already to a limited extent; we need to stress<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d85fn4">The word “broaden” has been crossed out and
                                “stress” has been inserted by hand.</note> the concept “food for
                            development” and popularize it.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia has been an excellent example. Large quantities of American
                            food made available to the Yugoslav government and sold for local
                            currency have not only averted hunger in Yugoslavia but have generated
                            the funds necessary for important development projects. One of the
                            results has been that Yugoslavia no longer needs American food imports,
                            which can be diverted where they are more needed. Another result is that
                            Yugoslavia is making better progress toward meeting the present and
                            future needs of its people than it could as a member of the Soviet bloc.
                            Use of food for development on a limited scale has also been successful
                            in India.</p>
                        <p>In Europe after the war, our agricultural products helped prime the pump.
                            In many parts of Asia and Africa today food can help build the pump. The
                            example of building a railroad was used above. Wheat can also generate
                            funds to build universities, pay teachers, and subsidize students.</p>
                        <p>Generous and kind as the American people are, in the long run they will
                            probably give much more enthusiastic support to a food program geared to
                            developing a foreign country than they will to an appeal to feed the
                            hungry. (This does not apply, of course, to disaster relief, or to other
                            emergency measures, when the American people will of course want to
                            help.) Food for development programs have the extra advantage of
                            promising an eventual end, and a happy one, even if a long way off.</p>
                        <p>I am not suggesting that the slogan “Food for Peace” be abandoned. I do
                            suggest that consideration be given to emphasizing that “Food for Peace”
                            means primarily food for development. The slogan might even be expanded
                            to “Food for Peace through Development.”</p>

                        <p>I believe it would be useful to send a food-for-peace mission immediately
                            to Latin America to explore the manner in which our food abundance can
                            be used to help end hunger and malnutrition in every area of suffering

                        <p>I spent an hour with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                            this morning during which he outlined his understanding of what the
                            President wanted to accomplish in this field and we discussed various
                            possible approaches and means for overcoming the obvious difficulties in
                            the way of accomplishment prior to the presentation of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '62 aid program.</p>
                        <p>He asked that we do some preliminary work on what we thought would be a
                            fair distribution of an increment of about $1 billion in European aid
                            defined, as we would define it, to exclude private investment <pb
                                n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0222"/>and exporter credits. He also
                            asked that we prepare a diplomatic plan of campaign.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the latter I would recommend on the basis of my
                            discussion with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, and I
                            think he would agree with the broad outlines, that we should operate
                            approximately as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Get <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> to
                                    Washington as soon as possible and discuss with him in the
                                    context of an expanded US program the need for an expanded
                                    German program as an absolutely necessary prerequisite for an
                                    expanded European program. This is the crucial part of the
                                    operation. As Adenauer is concerned above all with his election
                                    prospects, he is likely to feel that too heavy pressure on him
                                    to commit himself to raise taxes or cut welfare expenditures to
                                    provide foreign aid will damage his election chances. Being a
                                    sensitive and often irrational old man, he could well interpret
                                    such pressure as reflecting a desire on the part of a new
                                    left-of-center government in the United States to have a similar
                                    government in Germany. It will be necessary to emphasize this
                                    program as a part of a general plan for putting new life into
                                    the Atlantic Alliance, as one in which the United States will
                                    add to its contribution and not just ask Europeans to pick up
                                    more and as one which is in Germany's interest as well as our
                                    own. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> has
                                    suggested that we may wish to offer to secure a commitment to
                                    such a program from Mr. Brandt in order to take it out of the
                                    election arena. This is a matter to be examined with great care
                                    to ensure that <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>
                                    doesn't resent it. Our future negotiating tactics should be
                                    explained to <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName> in
                                    detail so he feels he is in full knowledge of our plans and a
                                    full partner. Talking to <persName corresp="#p_AK3"
                                        >Adenauer</persName> may well not be enough as he does not
                                    really understand economic matters and may make general
                                    commitments which his Cabinet will talk him out of. There,
                                    therefore, should be other contacts in addition to that between
                                    our President and the Chancellor but, of course, with the
                                    Chancellor's approval.</item>

                                <item>The best chance of getting a general willingness to move ahead
                                    on aid in Europe would be to hold a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> Ministerial meeting, preferably of the 3
                                    Minister-type, by mid-March at which we would present a four or
                                    five-part package for revising and strengthening the alliance.
                                    Presumably such a package will include an attack on the division
                                    of the military effort as well as on the economic aid effort. A
                                    connection between the two must be recognized. Such a meeting
                                    should be asked to approve a commitment to move ahead on aid by
                                    all countries in a position to do so by a round amount divided
                                    between Europe and North America. Something should probably be
                                    agreed as to what counts as aid broadly speaking and as to the
                                    broad guiding plan which should govern the division among
                                    countries of such a program. The United States should make clear
                                    that any commitment is contingent. This is necessary to take
                                    account of the difference between the United States position,
                                    where the executive can <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0223"

                                <item>This decision in broad principle should be followed by a
                                    Ministerial meeting of <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> to

                                    necessary. Great stress must be placed throughout on avoiding

                                    categories of aid or definitions of capacity to pay or give

                        <p>I am in general agreement with the thesis that it is desirable to attempt
                            at the highest political level to obtain a political decision on the <pb
                                n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0224"/>part of European governments to
                            engage in an increased economic aid effort to be related to a similar
                            increased aid effort on our part. As I understand it, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> notion envisages a possible
                            dimension of an average of a billion dollars a year over the next four
                            years with flexible phasing.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me, however, that it would be most unwise to mix efforts to
                            extract such decisions from the Europeans with efforts to deal with the
                            military problem. It is true enough that increased military and economic
                            aid efforts come out of the same budgets but this is in itself a good
                            reason not to deal with the two together. The most important
                            consideration, however, seems to me to be the absence of a clear basis
                            for delineating what the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
                            posture should be. Most people concerned with the subject have been

                        <p>Obviously also, the negotiations envisaged presume a decision yet to be
                            made with regard to U.S. effort and a decision which can only be made in
                            the context of other decisions regarding the handling of foreign aid in
                            the 1962 budget.</p>

                                corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> made the comments below in
                            response to a question about the concept of burden sharing especially in
                            the field of aid to less-developed countries. He also said that he had
                            made similar points in his talk with Kristensen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that he believed
                            it was most important that we not permit the “statisticians” to dominate
                            any burden-sharing exercise. He thought that any burden-sharing
                            operation should be under firm political direction so that the outcome
                            of the exercise will make political sense. However, the help of
                            economists and statisticians should be sought in order to provide an
                            adequate factual basis for whatever general conclusions are reached. In
                            other words, the operation should involve an <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200"
                                facs="0226"/>interaction between political authorities, who should
                            be clearly in charge, and technical experts, who would provide a factual
                            rationale for the conclusions reached.</p>
                        <p>It is unlikely that the first attempt at arriving at an adequate
                            burden-sharing arrangement would result in agreement. The necessary next
                            step will undoubtedly be the establishment of a small, high-level,
                            independ-ent “Wise Men's” group, which would, it is to be hoped, reach
                            impartial conclusions regarding the overall nature of the Western effort
                            and the proper distribution of the burden.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> also said that he
                            thought representatives from selected less-developed countries should be
                            invited to participate with any <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            burden-sharing operation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                                >Rostow</persName> felt that the representatives should be drawn
                            from “hard criteria” less-developed countries. In other words, we should
                            not have representatives from countries which simply would bid for
                            excessively large aid from the Western world, but by countries like
                            India which have in the past established realistic criteria and which
                            would be interested in seeing the criteria kept on a realistic
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> my views
                            on the danger of attempting to combine into a single operation burden
                            sharing on both aid to less-developed countries and sharing of the
                            common defense burdens. I pointed out that combining them into a single
                            exercise in this way could well mean that the Europeans would bargain
                            off their defense responsibilities against their responsibilities to
                            provide economic aid to less-developed countries and that this would
                            undoubtedly work to the detriment of their defense efforts. Since it may
                            well be that we will be attempting to persuade the Europeans to increase
                            their defense efforts, particularly their conventional forces, and since
                            this will require them to allocate increased resources to defense, it
                            might therefore be seriously detrimental to our efforts in the defense
                            field if a single joint economic aid and defense burden-sharing exercise
                            were attempted.</p>

                                    that the briefing which Defense personnel were to provide as a
                                    point of departure for the meeting had not received prior review
                                    or clearance within the Pentagon. Thus all principal
                                    participants would be hearing it for the first time. Mr.
                                        <persName>Bundy</persName> of Defense then presented a
                                    briefing in two parts which covered, first, the development of
                                    Five Year Military Assistance Plans and the derivation of the
                                    $2.4 in new <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds for <gloss

                                    previous administration and, second, certain possible
                                    alterations in concept stemming from preliminary conclusions of
                                    evolving strategic studies which suggested themselves for
                                    further consideration. He noted that while there were obvious
                                    dangers inherent in generalizing on the direction of these
                                    strategic studies four basic patterns appear to be emerging
                                    which could materially affect military assistance planning: (1)
                                    the ability of U.S. forces to conduct effective limited war
                                    operations and thereby deter limited war is receiving higher
                                    priority than heretofore; (2) increased attention is being given
                                    to a greater sharing of the security burden by our more
                                    developed allies and the consequent tapping of their military
                                    potential; (3) Free World ability to counter the guerrilla and
                                    other subversive tactics of the Communists' sub-limited war
                                    threat is receiving greater emphasis; and (4) ultimate victory
                                    in the cold war is dependent on top priority being given to the
                                    achievement of self-sustaining growth by the underdeveloped
                                    countries.</p>

                                agreement to any proposed adjustments which affected our implied or
                                specific commitments. Mr. <persName>John Bell</persName> indicated
                                that a careful interagency review of basic political and military
                                concepts was deemed highly essential and suggested that the
                                President's submission of the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62
                                program should make clear to the Congress that such a review was
                                going forward.</item>

                                whether there was a consensus of views as to where, within the
                                President's budget, Military Assistance should be shown. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General
                                Lemnitzer expressed the strong view that <gloss target="#t_MAP1"

                                matter which should be explicitly checked with the President, who,
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> felt, may prefer a

                                de-emphasize the security aspect of foreign aid. It was generally
                                agreed that under either arrangement no adjustment was contemplated
                                in the administration and control of the program and that the place
                                of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> in the budget would be

                            <item>The foreign aid program we have inherited has these
                                characteristics. The bulk of the resources available is either for
                                direct military purposes (about $2 billion), or to assure military
                                base rights, to support military forces, or to avoid short-run
                                political or economic instability or collapse. Of the $2.2 billion
                                sought in the last Eisenhower budget for non-military purposes, less
                                than $500 million was for development purposes. We are in the
                                position of, say, the New Haven Railway, pouring out large sums to
                                keep afloat, but with neither a defined forward objective nor the
                                fresh capital to move towards it. We begin with a program that is
                                almost wholly defensive in character and one which commands neither
                                the resources, the administration, nor the criteria designed to move
                                the underdeveloped countries towards sustained economic
                                growth.</item>

                            <item>In addition, the program has the following familiar weaknesses.
                                Its financing, as well as its perspective, is short-run rather than
                                long-run. The small development component is mainly guided by a
                                project approach rather than an approach in terms of developing
                                whole nations. Its legislative underpinning is piecemeal, reflecting
                                geological layers of <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0231"/>past
                                interests and problems. Its administration is diffuse. Its personnel
                                is, for the most part, mediocre: in particular, the program is long
                                on technical assistance types and desperately short of men at home
                                and in the field who understand the economic development problem.
                                The European contribution to the whole program is inadequate,
                                somewhat misdirected, and there is no effective machinery for
                                coordinating our own efforts with those of the Europeans. At home
                                there is profound uneasiness and dissatisfaction with a program
                                which has appeared to yield little result at great cost. This is
                                where we start.</item>

                            <item>In general, the new look consists of a turn-around from a
                                defensive effort to shore-up weak economies and to buy short-run
                                political and military advantage, to a coordinated Free World effort
                                with enough resources to move forward those nations prepared to
                                mobilize their own resources for development purposes. The goal is
                                to help other countries learn how to grow. Aid ends when
                                self-sustained growth is achieved and borrowing can proceed in
                                normal commercial ways; e.g., Mexico. This notion can be made an
                                effective basis for a new non-colonial approach of the Atlantic
                                Community to the southern half of the world; and even relatively
                                poor countries, who have passed the take-off, can contribute—in
                                technical assistance if not in long-term capital; e.g., Mexico,
                                Israel, Philippines, as well as Japan.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The crucial element here is the new criteria we wish applied in
                                granting aid. Aid shall go to those who have developed at home the
                                capacity to absorb capital productively. We cannot, clearly, pull
                                the plug immediately on countries we are shoring up (e.g., Viet-Nam,
                                Laos, Jordan); nor can we eliminate aid from places where we are
                                buying what we regard as a serious military advantage [<hi
                                    rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>].What we can do is shift rapidly out of
                                defense support and special assistance into long-term development
                                lending in places where there appears to be a basis for turn-around
                                (e.g., Taiwan, Korea, Turkey, Greece, the Philippines, and even,
                                perhaps, Iran). We can put countries which are asking for aid but do
                                not now have good development programs, on notice that they must
                                develop serious domestic programs before any increases in aid will
                                be granted; e.g., Indonesia and Afghanistan. This kind of response,
                                however, can only be given without grave political risk if we have
                                long-run borrowing authority, or its equivalent, so we can say the
                                funds are, in effect, earmarked against the time when, with our
                                help, they have qualified under the new criteria. Most important of
                                all, we must promptly expand our commitments to those countries
                                which now have the capacity to absorb capital productively in a
                                reasonably short period; e.g., India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Argentina,
                                Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela.</item>

                            <item>More concretely, the program we must devise should have these

                                    <item>—Military aid should be separated in the budget; but it
                                        should be under tighter civil control with respect to policy
                                        than it now is.</item>
                                    <item>—Both the scale and the type of forces we support under
                                        the military aid program should be put under fresh scrutiny,
                                        notably in the light of the guerrilla problem.</item>
                                    <item>—A concerted effort should be made, through our military
                                        aid programs, to induce the local military to use their
                                        military resources for constructive purposes.</item>
                                    <item>—Given the situation in Korea, Viet-Nam, Taiwan, and
                                        Jordan, it is doubtful if in the first year we can much
                                        reduce total aid to our rickety partners; but a concerted
                                        effort to squeeze non-development aid this year should be
                                        attempted.</item>
                                    <item>—The development funds available must be put on a long-run
                                        basis. This is crucial.</item>
                                    <item>—The volume of American development funds available over,
                                        say, a four-year period must be enlarged at about an average
                                        rate of $1 billion a year more than the $500 million or so
                                        we now command. But the application of the new criteria
                                        makes it unlikely that actual disbursements would increase
                                        very much in the first year of the new program. Of this
                                        average $1 billion per annum increase, half might well
                                        consist of expend-itures for agricultural
                                        commodities.</item>
                                    <item>—The outcome of the burden sharing exercise in <gloss
                                            target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> should be a net increase
                                        in long-term development aid from other industrialized
                                        countries of about the same order of magnitude; that is, an
                                        extra $1 billion per annum over present levels. This would
                                        give us an extra Free World margin of about $2 billion a

                                        within the foreign aid organization, or whether we go on
                                        with annual appropriations with a vague Marshall Plan type

                            <item>Since November 8, 1960, a most extraordinary concentration of
                                thought and memoranda-writing has taken place on the question of how
                                to reorganize foreign aid. Much of this literature is centered about
                                whether the foreign aid structure should be built around a country
                                or a functional approach. The crucial issues to watch are these: <list>

                            concern and strong convictions on the historic situation in which we now
                            find ourselves.</p>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0236"/>
                        <p>I feel certain that this concern and these convictions are widely shared
                            by all those who have worked to produce these new proposals. The scale,
                            shape, and direction of the new proposals are themselves based on an
                            awareness of the increasing seriousness of the world situation. But we
                            are also aware that both public opinion and political sentiment on
                            Capitol Hill require the highest level Presidential leadership if our
                            proposals are to attract the necessary support.</p>
                        <p>Unquestionably, the need for the intelligent use of foreign assistance
                            continues and is likely to increase. In three underdeveloped continents
                            we have reached a watershed where the holding operations of the past are
                            clearly inadequate and where new initiative of a dramatic and positive
                            kind are essential. Even if the Soviet threat did not exist, these
                            requirements would be present and should impel us and other economically
                            developed countries to adopt new policies. But the Soviet threat itself
                            is taking on new forms, specifically including the availability of
                            massive sums for trade and aid to be expended as Soviet political aims
                            dictate.</p>
                        <p>Here at home the political and public climate for the aid program has
                            been allowed to deteriorate just at the time when a more sophisticate
                            understanding and a stronger long-term commitment is needed.</p>
                        <p>Part of this is the result of years of fraudulent justifications of the
                            program as a short-term, anti-communist, quick-results proposition. Part
                            of it is the understandable effect of boredom with the old symbols,
                            maladministration and waste, neo-isolationism, and the protectionism
                            produced by the economic distress inside our own economy.</p>
                        <p>I believe that most of us who have worked on this program feel that we
                            have come to an important crossroads. In all likelihood, a fresh,
                            positive aid program, scaled to the requirements, and presented with
                            persist-ence and boldness, has a much better chance of Congressional
                            approval and popular acclaim than another round of the old Mutual
                            Security bill with the now standard figures on military assistance,
                            “defense support”, “special assistance”, and all the rest.</p>
                        <p>We are facing a period much like 1940, when Lend Lease would never have
                            been thought politically possible by ordinary politicians, but when
                            farsighted leadership and Presidential initiative achieved a
                            breakthrough. This is also a time like 1947, when neither the Congress
                            nor the country was supposed to be ready for the Marshall Plan, but when
                            a similar energy and influence provided the national momentum we
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>The accompanying proposals have been drafted under the assumption that
                            the top leadership in the new Administration throughout the White House,
                            Cabinet, and sub-Cabinet levels, can and will be mobilized to undertake
                            the important assignments in public education which will be an essential
                            prerequisite to the program's enactment. In practical terms, this will
                            require a major public effort in the months of April and <pb n="211"
                                xml:id="pg_211" facs="0237"/>May between the presentation of your
                            aid message and the presentation of the detailed program on Capitol
                            Hill.</p>
                        <p>These considerations are uppermost in my mind at the moment, and I am
                            sure that my colleagues share them. I think it is essential that they be
                            appreciated and understood at the outset, for without them the program
                            itself will be in trouble and indeed would not have been devised.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bob: At our meeting on February 25, a record of which is
                                attached,<note n="1" xml:id="d96fn1">Not attached, but reference is
                                to <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> we agreed that a
                            review of the basic premises underlying the Military Assistance Program
                            should be initiated without delay while recognizing that the complexity
                            of the problem would require a considerable period of time to assure an
                            adequate product. I believe we should pursue this effort with a view to
                            having at least initial recommendations for our joint consideration by
                            May 1.</p>
                        <p>I suggest that this matter can be most effectively approached by a joint
                            State-Defense effort. I have asked Mr. <persName>Charles
                                Burton</persName> Marshall to undertake this and he will be in touch
                            with you in the very near future.</p>
                        <p>Substantively, I would anticipate that our efforts should address
                            themselves to an assessment of evolving political, economic and military
                            concepts as they relate to a projection of how the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> should be formulated as to best serve
                            United States strategic interests, including our foreign policy
                            objectives, in the future. As I indicated at our meeting I believe that
                            there are a number of problems in the various geographic areas which
                            require a fresh look, initially uninhibited by preconceptions as to the
                            limitations placed upon us by our past policy posture. As you know, we
                            already have underway a number of studies such as those being conducted
                            by Mr. Acheson on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss><note n="2"

                            upon. Similarly the Defense studies which you made reference to, such as

                            would undoubtedly make a major contribution to achieving an effective
                            reassessment of the basic promises underlying the military assistance
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Those and other similar areas of investigation should proceed from the
                            basic policy guidance outlined in my letter to you of February 4<note

                            reassessment of our military assistance program as an essential part of
                            the total long-range study of U.S. military posture to which my letter
                            was addressed.</p>

                            prompt but thorough address to this matter, and I am sure that you share
                            an equal interest in having the fullest and most effective Defense

                                economic situation of the individual recipient country. It is not
                                enough to examine only the individual projects on which the money is
                                spent and the extent to which they are self-liquidating. Rather, it
                                is in relation to a country's total expected growth rate and its
                                balance of payments that a judgment must be made as to its capacity
                                to service additional external debt. In most less-developed
                                countries today, the principal need is for grants or “soft” loans.
                                Only when a country is well on the way to achieving cumulative
                                growth should an increasing fraction of outside resources be made

                                contribution of each should be in relation to his capacity to pay.
                                The rich should contribute a larger fraction of their income than
                                those less well off. The contribution to economic aid must take full
                                account of the contribution to the joint defense.</item>

                            and “managed to insert a little of the new philosophy into the text

                        <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, Sorensen
                            wrote a “low-key first draft of the aid message,” which “was geared to
                            the rather gloomy prospects on the Hill. <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> evidently wished to aim somewhat higher. He had
                            Sorensen send the draft to me for revision. And, when <persName

                            suggested by me (and perhaps, by others), Sorensen, quite typically,
                            carried forward in a more heroic direction with verve and elegance.”
                                (<hi rend="italic">The Diffusion of Power: An Essay in Recent

                        <p>The President's message began with a discussion of three propositions: 1)
                            the existing foreign aid programs were “largely unsatisfactory and
                            unsuited for our needs and for the needs of the underdeveloped world as
                            it enters the Sixties;” 2) the economic collapse of free but less-
                            developed nations “would be disastrous to our national security, harmful
                            to our comparative prosperity and offensive to our conscience;” and 3)
                            the 1960s presented “an historical opportunity” for the United States
                            and other free industrialized nations to initiate a major foreign
                            assistance effort that could “move more than half the people of the
                            less-developed nations into self-sustained economic growth, while the
                            rest move substantially closer to the day when they, too, will no longer
                            have to depend on outside assistance.”</p>
                        <p>After elaborating at some length on these points, the President expounded
                            on “a whole new set of basic concepts and principles,” which included
                            integration in a single agency of the aid programs of the International
                            Cooperation Administration, Development Loan Fund, Food-for-Peace,
                            Export-Import Bank, and the Peace Corps; the need for country plans
                            carefully tailored to meet the needs of each country; long-term
                            financing and planning; special focus on development loans repayable in
                            dollars; and special attention to those nations most willing to utilize
                            their own resources, make necessary reforms, and engage in long-range
                            planning. He also emphasized a multilateral approach designed to
                            encourage and complement an enlarged foreign aid emphasis of other
                            industrialized nations, and a separation of social and economic
                            development from military assistance.</p>
                        <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0246"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> concluded by
                            asking Congress for a foreign aid budget of $4 billion, which the
                            previous administration had requested, although he proposed reduction of
                            the military assistance component from about $1.8 billion to $1.6
                            billion so that more could be spent on economic aid, especially
                            development loans.</p>

                            important feature of transformation <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                >OEEC</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. This common
                            task of aiding <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s is more difficult
                            and complex than problem encountered in connection Marshall Plan. <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s not only have great need for capital
                            but also for skills and administrative talents. This task requires not
                            only contribution of our resources but also our ingenuity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized that present
                            decade must be decade of development. No task confronting us is more
                            important. If we succeed there is real chance that <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s may be able direct their energies to
                            constructive tasks. But if they become convinced that benefits of
                            industrialization are not being attained there is a great chance that
                            their energies will be turned to destructive ends.</p>
                        <p>Even a substantially increased effort to assist <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>s will require only small portion of our total
                            resources. Assistance in magnitude of one percent of our aggregate
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> is relatively small and we must
                            think in terms of sustained effort of approximately this magnitude.</p>
                        <p>In assessing contribution of each country to such a joint aid effort
                            account must be taken of other contributions to the common welfare, with
                            particular reference to defense expenditures. Also an assessment of
                            proper share for each country should be based on capacity to pay, with
                            richer countries making proportionately greater effort than those less
                            well off. Balance of payments considerations are most relevant to form
                            of aid. Countries with persistent payment surpluses should make aid to
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s available on untied basis.
                            Countries with payments deficits could extend aid on tied basis.</p>
                        <p>Concerning quality of aid, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            said it essential recognize that aid should be tailored to requirements
                            of <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s. There is substantial difference
                            between usefulness to <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s and burden on
                            industrialized countries of short-term export credits and grants and
                            long-term loans. He warned against putting too much emphasis on
                            short-term loans. Industrialized countries must be careful not put LDCs
                            in position of having become capital exporting countries because of
                            necessity repaying short-time loans. Type of assistance that contributes
                            most to economic development is that made available by official grants
                            and long-term loans as part sustained governmental program. If <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s are to make necessary sacrifices they
                            need to be assured that economic assistance will be sustained over

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concluded by indicating that
                            this proposal on joint aid effort reflected US determination to move
                            forward with our partners in common endeavors in <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. In view magnitude of task and
                            shortness of time, he urged others to approach problem of assisting less
                            developed countries in same spirit.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (Barber) welcomed US statement and
                            characterized it as inspiring, constructive and extremely important.
                            Barber said that task was of immense proportions and great importance
                            and that <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> members should strive to
                            respond positively to US proposal.</p>
                        <p>Barber said US proposal was complex and would require careful study. He
                            made following preliminary remarks: he stated that <gloss
                                target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> was
                            proper place to discuss levels of aid and country contributions.
                            Concerning question of taking into account defense expenditures, Barber
                            said that this was relevant factor for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            with worldwide commitments. He was not, however, ready to agree at
                            present that defense effort has general relevance in assessing aid
                            contributions.</p>
                        <p>Barber welcomed emphasis placed by US on type of assistance most likely
                            to help <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s. He considered that it
                            would be useful to arrive at some agreement on what constitutes aid.</p>
                        <p>Concerning US procedural suggestions Barber said <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> was willing to consider what steps might be usefully
                            taken to facilitate transformation of <gloss target="#t_DAG1"
                                >DAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> so that <gloss
                                target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> could take over going concern full of
                            vitality and purpose when <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> comes
                            into force.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion Barber said that all must do as much as possible to help
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s and respond to US proposal in
                            that spirit.</p>
                        <p>Germany (<persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName>) welcomed
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s aid message
                            and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s statement. He said
                                <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> countries must not fail respond
                            to US initiative. Germany welcomed basic points of US proposal. He
                            thought it useful set goal for general aid effort and welcomed
                            opportunity discuss principles pertaining capacity to pay—most important
                            of which in German eyes was concept of progressivity. He cautioned
                            against examining defense expenditures in <gloss target="#t_DAG1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> welcomed idea of permanent
                            chairman for <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> and considered it
                            desirable expand exchange information as basis intensified coordination
                            aid policies. He proposed that first permanent chairman be American.</p>
                        <p>Italy (Aggradi) characterized US proposals as far-reaching and requiring
                            careful study. He presented preliminary Italian reaction in very general
                            terms as follows: He said it absolutely essential prevent increased
                            disparity between standards of living in developed and less developed
                            countries. Italy agreed in principle to joint program of aid to <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s sustained for long period. Aggradi
                            said that Italian experience in southern Italy demonstrates that
                            long-term loans and grants are much more useful than short-term
                            credits.</p>
                        <p>France (Sadrin) expressed agreement with many features of US proposal. He
                            stated his understanding that US does not intend formulate precise
                            mathematical formula for burden sharing. Sadrin stated that all <gloss
                                target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> countries should undertake aid effort
                            of about one percent <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> and that we
                            should take opportunity provided by <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss> to harmonize aid efforts. He agreed to concept
                            permanent chairman for <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Canada (Plumptre) welcomed inspiring initiative so ably presented by
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. He pleased that US
                            should have given question of aid to less developed countries such high
                            priority and stressed need for common effort. He welcomed <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s comments on quality as well as
                            quantity of aid, indicating that unbridled extension of short-term loans
                            could be harmful.</p>
                        <p>He agreed aid should be increased and improved. However, he had some
                            question as to whether it would be wise put forward as goal one percent
                            of income. With this qualification Plumptre welcomed substance and
                            spirit of US proposal and agreed to strengthening <gloss
                                target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> by appointing permanent chairman.</p>
                        <p>Japan (Shimoda) expressed appreciation to US for putting forward such
                            extensive plan. He said that while unable make drastic increase Japan
                            will do best and will cooperate with other countries.</p>
                        <p>Concerning burden sharing, Shimoda considered it essential take fully
                            into account per capita income. He also cautioned against referring in
                            public to common defense because of probable reaction of <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>Netherlands (Van Houten) welcomed US initiative and stated that aid
                            effort of all industrialized nations should be intensified. Concerning
                            goal of one percent <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, Van Houten
                            expressed agreement with Canadian position. He agreed with US proposal
                            for permanent chairman.</p>
                        <p>Belgium (Daufresne de la Chevallerie) said that aid is problem common to
                            all and that coordination of aid efforts is essential. He agreed that
                                <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>, within framework <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, should be forum for discussing aid
                            coordination.</p>

                        <p>Portugal (Pereira) said it premature to establish program of any given

                                target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> session Heads of Delegation Meeting was
                            held to consider further U.S. proposal. Minutes of Meeting, of which two
                            copies circulated to each Delegation, are quoted below.</p>
                        <p>"Sir <persName>Frank Lee</persName> said that he had suggested this
                            restricted meeting because he thought that it would be helpful if Heads
                            of Delegations considered together what should be aimed at as the
                            outcome of the Fourth meeting of the Group in respect of the proposals
                            made by the United States Government. There might be some limit to the
                            extent to which it was practicable to take final decisions at this
                            meeting, but it was important to convey the sense of urgency which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had emphasized and which
                            all Delegations shared.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he had had an
                            opportunity since he made his statement at the first full session<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d102fn1">See <ref target="#d101">Document
                                101</ref>.</note> of having some conversations with Heads of
                            Delegations and their colleagues and had found that there were some
                            areas where his proposals were perhaps not fully understood.</p>
                        <p>"So far as burden sharing was concerned the United States aim was to
                            secure recognition from the major industrial powers that they each had
                            an obligation to contribute to the effort to raise the standard of the
                            less-developed countries to the fullest extent, having regard to their
                            own capacity and commitments. It was not the intention at this stage to
                            seek agreement on a precise mathematical measure of what each country's
                            effort <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0251"/>should be. The
                            suggestion that 1% of the aggregate national incomes of the
                            industrialised countries should be devoted to less-developed countries
                            was a broad indication of the overall target. It was not a new figure:
                            something of the kind had been talked of for some time past. It might be
                            possible later for the D.A.C. or the Development Assistance Committee of
                            the O.E.C.D. to consider whether a more precise formula which was
                            acceptable could be found, but he entirely agreed that there should be
                            no question of dictation by the Group to member countries. He thought
                            that an extended exchange of information about member countries'
                            policies and programmes and the pooling of common experience might lead
                            to more effective action and should be considered by the D.A.C., which
                            should also address itself to the somewhat delicate question of its own
                            relations with the less developed countries.</p>
                        <p>"So far as the proposal that the D.A.G. should have a full-time Chairman
                            was concerned he said that the description ‘full-time' was more
                            important than the description ‘permanent'. It was clear that the
                            Chairman would have to be an experienced man of first-rate qualities but
                            a man who at the same time could work easily with member Governments and
                            not impose his views on them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> hoped that this meeting of the Group would be able
                            to agree in principle that there should be a full-time Chairman for the
                            future. This would give considerable impetus to the work of the Group:
                            and problems could be the more readily solved the earlier they were
                            tackled. Delay would mean not only wasted time but that the task ahead
                            might prove still more difficult.</p>
                        <p>"M. Sadrin (France) said that the D.A.G. did not itself make a
                            contribution to the less developed countries but one of its functions
                            was as it were to carry a message to them. The effect of the United
                            States proposals would be to give a clear impression that the D.A.G. in
                            future would concentrate on practical measures rather than purely
                            theoretical approaches to the problem of providing aid, and this
                            impression would be reinforced by the appointment of a Chairman who
                            would devote his full time to the work of the Group. Co-ordination could
                            be even more important than an increase in the total amount of aid since
                            it would help to ensure that aid was not wasted, and it was most
                            desirable that the Chairman, who could bring about better coordination,
                            should begin work without delay.</p>
                        <p>"So far as the 1% formula was concerned, this would have the advantage of
                            demonstrating the desire of the industrialised countries to continue to
                            contribute to the poorer countries according to their means and
                            capacity, but he thought that it was important that no specified amount
                            of aid should be allocated to donor countries. In any case nothing was
                            more difficult than to find a statistical formula which would suit a
                            number of countries. The intangible pressures which a Group like the
                            D.A.G. could put upon member countries could be more effective than
                            agreement on mathematical burden sharing.</p>

                        <p>"<persName>M. Marjolin</persName> (European Economic Commission) said
                            that he agreed fully with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> that the most urgent task was the creation of an
                            effective D.A.G. with a competent and skilful Chairman and a good
                            Secretariat. The essence of the problem was co-ordination and this in
                            turn implied a need for more information. Among the first tasks of an
                            improved D.A.G. would therefore be, as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> had said, an extension of existing reporting
                            procedures. This involved some difficult technical problems—for example
                            the question of comparability of aid statistics—but he had no doubt that
                            a meeting of experts from the countries concerned could find solutions
                            quite quickly. The D.A.G. itself should proceed to a broad exchange of
                            views on the experience of member countries. In particular they should
                            be frank about aid which in the past had been wasted or not used to the
                            best advantage. The provision of aid also raised certain social and
                            political problems which might be considered in a more restricted
                            session of the D.A.G. like the present meeting of Heads of Delegations.
                            In theory it was possible to argue that while each country should
                            control its own programmes there should be a broad ‘division of labour'
                            among donor countries and programmes should be co-ordinated beforehand,
                            but each donor country had areas of priority and had to make its own
                            decisions about the direction of its own effort. He thought that the
                            D.A.G., and later the Development Assistance Committee of the O.E.C.D.,
                            should be ready to help under-developed countries to draft their own aid
                            programmes. The President of the United States had said that if aid was
                            to be provided by the donor countries on a long term basis there should
                            be long term planning on the part of the recipients also, but many of
                            the less developed countries could not draft their programmes without
                            outside help. He thought finally that it might be desirable for a
                            Working Party to meet before the next session of the D.A.G. to consider
                            how best the Group might be made a more efficient instrument.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> (Germany) said that
                            he agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that the
                            principle should be adopted that each country must do the maximum that
                            it could having regard to its own circumstances, and must decide for
                            itself what contribution it should make, though he sympathised with the
                            view that it was useful to have some formula as a guide so long as a
                            precise allocation was not imposed on donor countries. So far as the
                            question of a full-time Chairman was concerned it would be useful to
                            obtain a decision at this meeting on this matter, but this would have to
                            be a decision in principle only since it was necessary to know in more
                            detail the precise functions which the Chairman would have. It was
                            important to proceed slowly and not to put too much power in the hands
                            of the Chairman at the outset. It might be desirable to set up a small
                            working party to consider what the functions of a full-time Chairman
                            should be. It was certainly important not to lose time. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> added that in his view it was
                            important to examine all programmes and projects for aid to
                            under-developed <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0253"/>countries so as
                            to ensure that they were arranged in the interests of the less developed
                            countries themselves and not in the interest of the exporters of the
                            donor countries. Only on this disinterested basis could the Group hope
                            to achieve its political aims.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. Ferrari-Aggradi (Italy) said that he entirely agreed that there was
                            a need for effective action, but the present meeting should seek
                            agreement on the aims of the Group rather than on details. It was right
                            that each country's effort should be made in accordance with its own
                            capacity. His Government fully recognised the importance of the problem
                            of aid to under-developed countries and thought that the next few years
                            would be crucial. There were many difficulties in this field, both
                            economic, psychological and practical. There was a lack of capital and a
                            shortage of trained men, as well as the psychological difficulty that
                            the less developed countries were often impatient to get ahead with
                            development plans more quickly than was practicable. While it was
                            important that donor countries should themselves act quickly and
                            decisively, it was nevertheless true that long-term programmes needed
                            time in their preparation as well as their fulfilment. The Group would
                            be achieving something if it gave hope that the programmes would be
                            carried out. So far as the question of a full-time Chairman was
                            concerned he agreed that this was most desirable. He thought also that
                            aid should be organized on a regional basis since the problems were not
                            the same, for example, in Latin America and in Africa. The question of
                            co-ordination and collaboration was most important, since among other
                            things it would help to avoid mistrust and should lead to a more
                            effective joint effort.</p>
                        <p>"Sir Denis Rickett (United Kingdom) thought that it might be useful to
                            consider briefly the past history of the Group. Its life had been
                            relatively short and it had held three meetings.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d102fn2">The first three meetings of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> were in Washington March 9-11,
                                1960, Bonn July 5-7, 1960, and Washington October 3-5, 1960.

                            collection of information, and this had led to the preparation of the

                                created on January 13, 1960, and the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1"
                                    >OEEC</gloss> approved the following day. The <gloss

                            confrontation under which the host Government on each occasion made a
                            statement about its own aid policies and practices and was subject to
                            questioning by other member governments. In addition the third meeting
                            of the Group had concerned itself with the question of technical
                            assistance. The Group already had some achievement to its credit: the
                            question now was to determine how far its functions should be changed
                                <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0254"/>and developed. It should be
                            remembered that at the first meeting it had been expressly decided and
                            stated in the Press Communique that the ‘Group's efforts should not
                            involve discussion of amounts of financing for particular regions,
                            countries or projects'. It might be desirable to reconsider this, but it
                            would be necessary to examine the position thoroughly before any change
                            was made. The Group had also agreed that it would not embark on
                            elaborate statistical calculations of burden sharing, though an
                            equitable distribution of the burden of providing aid had always been
                            one of the broad objectives of the Group. What might now be desirable
                            would be to consider whether there were any objective tests which could
                            be applied so as to ensure that member countries were taking a fair
                            share.</p>
                        <p>"So far as the question of a full-time Chairman was concerned, he thought
                            that this was an eminently sensible idea and that the importance of the
                            Group's work fully warranted the appointment of someone who could impart
                            new drive and direction to it. In addition it might be desirable to
                            arrange in future for fewer large formal sessions and more informal
                            restricted meetings. The Working Party which had been meeting in Paris
                            under Dr. Stedtfeld's Chairmanship had already achieved a great deal in
                            a short space of time, and still more use might be made of such working
                            parties. The next steps might be to get ahead with the appointment of a
                            full-time Chairman and then for a small group to be called together to
                            draw up plans for the future work of the D.A.G.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. Plumptre (Canada) said that it was clear that the D.A.G. could be
                            more useful in future if it concentrated on an improvement of both the
                            quality and the quantity of aid programmes. He welcomed the proposal
                            that there should be a full-time Chairman whose own character and
                            ability, however, would be of supreme importance. So far as proposals
                            for the expansion of arrangements for exchanging information were
                            concerned, he thought that member countries ought to be sure that the
                            information already available was being fully used before it was agreed
                            to embark upon still further exercises. So far as the question of a
                            formula was concerned, he attached much more importance to the influence
                            of personality than to mathematical calculations, and thought that the
                            right Chairman could help to solve the problem by giving sensible and
                            effective guidance. The provision of aid was a heterogeneous matter: it
                            depended very greatly on the political background in each donor country,
                            and formulae which suited political conditions in one country would not
                            suit another. It would in his view be necessary for the D.A.G. to move
                            very cautiously in respect of any direct consultation with the
                            under-developed countries. The United Nations and the other
                            international institutions of which the less developed countries were
                            members were far more suitable bodies for activity of this kind. He
                            agreed that the Group <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0255"/>should
                            consider most carefully the question of changing the decision that it
                            should not allocate aid to countries or projects.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. Kristensen (Organisation for European Economic Co-operation) said
                            that so far as reporting of aid transactions and the exchange of
                            information was concerned the arrangements made within O.E.E.C. were
                            already developing and improving. The Basic Study of the flow of funds
                            from donor countries in the years 1956-59 would be kept up to date by a
                            system of half yearly reporting and the Secretariat was now seeking also
                            to provide figures, so far as possible, of the flow of funds into
                            recipient countries. They were finding new staff and hoped to embark on
                            new analysis and evaluation. So far as the question of the early
                            appointment of a full-time Chairman was concerned he agreed that a man
                            with all the qualities which had been mentioned could make the Group
                            very effective, but there were difficulties about the proposal. In
                            particular, the Preparatory Commission had recommended that the
                            Development Assistance Committee of the new O.E.C.D. should appoint its
                            own Chairman.<note n="4" xml:id="d102fn4">On July 23, 1960, the <gloss

                            appointment of a full-time Chairman for the Group was desirable it was
                            advisable to leave the actual election until after the O.E.C.D. came
                            into being. There might be danger in the interim period in having two
                            centres of gravity—the Chairman of the D.A.G. and the Secretariat of the
                            O.E.E.C. There might also be intensified difficulties with less
                            developed countries and members of O.E.E.C. who were not members of the
                            D.A.G., as well as those who were considering whether to join, and this
                            should be borne in mind. If the Working Party which it had been
                            suggested might be set up to consider the new functions of the D.A.G.
                            were agreed upon it might also consider these problems.</p>
                        <p>"Mr. Shimoda (Japan) said that while he agreed that the idea of a
                            full-time Chairman had advantages there were some disadvantages and he
                            found it difficult to come to a conclusion without knowing more
                            precisely what the powers and functions of the Chairman would be.
                            Moreover, since Japan was not a member of the O.E.C.D. he would like to
                            have time to consider the relationship of this Chairman and the O.E.C.D.
                            He entirely agreed that the matter was urgent but nevertheless thought
                            that there should be time for him to consult his Government before the
                            Group took any decisions.</p>
                        <p>"Dr. Pereira (Portugal) said that he thought that ideally the election of
                            the Chairman should not be made until after the O.E.C.D. came into
                            being. If it were decided to nominate a Chairman of the Group before <pb
                                n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0256"/>that, much would depend on the
                            powers to be given to the Chairman and the qualities of the man who was
                            proposed to be elected and he could not give a final decision on behalf
                            of his Government. He was attracted by Sir Denis Rickett's proposal that
                            the D.A.G. should meet more frequently in smaller groups.</p>
                        <p>"Dr. Van Houten (Netherlands) agreed about the desirability of a full
                            time Chairman for the Group who would be able, among other things, to
                            deal with the question of relations with the under-developed countries.
                            The powers given to the Chairman, would, however, be a matter for
                            consideration. He would have a very important co-ordinating task. He
                            would have to see that aid to under-developed countries was provided
                            more efficiently and to study the various proposals for burden-sharing
                            according to a formula. But he would have to base himself on the
                            assumption that the provision of aid to under-developed countries must
                            remain in essence a national responsibility. All these questions ought
                            to be considered in working out what should be the powers of a full-time
                            Chairman.</p>
                        <p>"M. Daufresne de la Chevallerie (Belgium) said that he had sympathy with
                            the view that the appointment of a full-time Chairman before the
                            inception of the O.E.C.D. could create two separate centres of gravity
                            even though the Chairman of the D.A.G. sat in Paris, and that this must
                            receive full consideration.</p>
                        <p>"The following further points were made in discussion:</p>

                            meeting) said that it was quite clear that the D.A.G. could not appoint
                            the Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee of the O.E.C.D. <pb

                            possible for member countries of the D.A.G. to agree upon the election
                            of a Chairman of the D.A.G., and to arrange subsequently that the same
                            Chairman should be elected by the Development Assistance Committee. The
                            discussion had illustrated some of the difficulties which the proposal
                            that there should be a full-time Chairman of the D.A.G. presented, but
                            it had also shown the broad lines on which a resolution for adoption by

                        <p>In opening the discussion on aid to underdeveloped countries, the
                            President stated that useful discussions had taken place with Foreign
                            Minister von Brentano in February,<note n="2" xml:id="d104fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d91fn1">footnote 1, Document 91</ref>.</note> and that
                            more recently Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had held
                            equally useful talks in Bonn on this subject.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d104fn3">See <ref target="#d99">Document
                            99</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>The President added that it is in the common interest of all of us to
                            provide for a stable economy for the underdeveloped countries, so that
                            they will see some hope in solving their problem through a non-communist
                            system. He cited one example of German aid efforts for which the US is
                            particularly grateful—what they are doing in Bolivia. The President
                            stated that this is most helpful. The US has been carrying a very heavy
                            aid burden for the past few years, and the needs are growing rather than
                            diminishing. Therefore the US will appreciate anything the Federal
                            Republic can do to help.</p>
                        <p>The President added that the US feels that the Atlantic Community is the
                            key and the anchor to free world security. If the world to the south
                            becomes unstable and insecure, then the Atlantic Community will be
                            insecure. Therefore all these aid efforts should be coordinated. The US
                            aid program is now to be more efficiently coordinated. There should be
                            continuing consultation between countries so that each country knows
                            what is being done by other countries in the aid field. Foreign aid
                            should be a multi-national and not a national effort.</p>
                        <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0260"/>
                        <p>The President noted that there are presently four areas offering
                            possibilities for cooperative efforts:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Bolivia</hi>—Bolivia is a most critical problem, both
                            politically and economically. This would be the worst time for the
                            Castro regime to get a foothold in another Latin American country; this
                            would add momentum to the Communist movement at a time when the momentum
                            is going down.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Turkey</hi>—Here is a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> ally which has vigorously opposed the Soviet Union and
                            which is maintaining a large military program, assisted by substantial
                            US grant aid. Turkey has a critical economic problem, resulting in
                            considerable measure from its military effort.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">India and Pakistan</hi>—Both countries have broad
                            long-range economic development plans which call for continuing and
                            large-scale external assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President then called on Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> to comment on aid to underdeveloped countries. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that steps are
                            being taken within the forum of the <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> to expand and improve the
                            areas of cooperation for providing assistance to underdeveloped
                            countries. As to India, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            noted that meeting with the consortium of nations responsible for
                            financing the third 5-year plan would be taking place in the next two to
                            three days to discuss the next economic plan for India. He hoped that
                            the Federal Republic could commit substantial amounts toward the
                            fulfillment of that plan, extending over the next two to three years.
                            Both Pakistan and India require financing for longer than a one-year
                            period. Pakistan also is being examined by a consortium of nations
                            meeting soon. The US is entering into a sizable burden of commitments,
                            and it is hoped that Germany can do likewise. Both countries need
                            long-term loans at low interest rates. Turkey too has a balance of
                            payments problem. It has taken on tremendous military burdens under its
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> commitments. The US has given
                            $90 million in grant aid over the past three years. We hope that the
                            Federal Republic can help now by providing long-term loans as well as
                            grant assistance, so as to not add further to Turkey's short-term
                            capital debt problem. On <gloss target="#t_COMIBOL1">COMIBOL</gloss>,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that we have a
                            representative in Bonn for discussions on Bolivia, and that the Federal
                            Republic has been very helpful in cooperating with us. We hope that in
                            view of the political situation, the Federal Republic will continue to
                            provide assistance to Bolivia, jointly with the United States
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister von Brentano said that there was a question whether in
                            the case of Bolivia, the problem was simply one of reviving <gloss
                                target="#t_COMIBOL1">COMIBOL</gloss>. Preliminary reports on the
                            German side indicated that a much broader program of economic
                            reconstruction would be required, costing a minimum of $150 million.</p>
                        <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0261"/>
                        <p>Turning to Turkey, the Foreign Minister reported that bilateral talks
                            will begin tomorrow in Bonn on the 1961 financial needs of that country.
                            The Federal Republic plans to make <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 100
                            million available for Turkey in 1961/62 and will also consider extending
                            long-term 3% loans for economic infrastructure purposes.</p>
                        <p>Minister Etzel recently visited India and tentatively pledged <gloss
                                target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 400 million in assistance for first year
                            of India's third 5-year plan. The Federal Republic will participate in
                            the consortium for the India and Pakistan programs along with the World
                            Bank.</p>
                        <p>As to Pakistan, the Federal Republic is prepared to make available <gloss
                                target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 75 million annually for 1961/62 and also
                            through the coordinated efforts of the consortium discuss possibilities
                            for further financial assist-ance.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then reverted to Turkey and stressed the
                            Chancellor's special interest in that country, which he regarded as a
                            particular responsibility of the Federal Republic to assist. A total of
                                <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 1.5 billion has been made
                            available up to the present time, and the Federal Republic is prepared
                            to undertake whatever may be necessary in further meas-ures.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister summed up by stating that the Germans are prepared
                            to do their share with the US on foreign aid through the <gloss
                                target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_OECD1"
                                >OECD</gloss>, and within this framework to determine what program
                            should be undertaken bilaterally and multilaterally.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that he was
                            grateful for von Brentano's statement. It shows there is general
                            agreement on the problem of foreign aid. He then commented briefly that
                            the US is prepared to extend substantial assist-ance to India and
                            Pakistan and hopes that in the consortium talks the Federal Republic
                            will contribute in proportionately substantial measure. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stressed the need for long-term
                            assistance to Turkey rather than short-term or even medium-term loans,
                            in view of their balance of payments situation. In conclusion, the US
                            would be pleased to discuss Bolivia with the German Government
                            representatives when they come to Washington in May for that
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed his gratification that progress is being made in
                            aid planning. The problem will continue for years to come. The US is now
                            trying to provide aid on a longer term basis. This is a difficult
                            political problem domestically, just as it must be for the
                            Chancellor.</p>

                            devoted to important technical changes—such as longer budget periods—but
                            the cards are stacked against a major shift in the pattern of

                            <item>There is a prevalent notion that education can be emphasized at
                                little cost by supporting a few pilot demonstrations here and there.
                                On this premise, people say they are all for an emphasis on
                                education but then end up providing meagre money for it. Actually
                                educational development will require a great deal of money and we
                                kid ourselves if we think otherwise.</item>

                        <p>For weeks now I have been pushing hard at every opportunity for a genuine

                            fully sympathetic, I am sure. But somehow, when the charts get drawn and
                            the budget figures get laid out, education tends to get obscured and
                            lost in the shuffle.</p>
                        <p>I am afraid that everyone has been so busy with the technical details
                            that insufficient attention has been given to the political dimensions,
                            both domestic and international, on which the success of the program
                            will ultimately rest.</p>

                                program. The philosophy should be clear and simple: a society's main
                                wealth is in its human resources; the development of people must
                                precede the development of industry (this is the history of U.S.
                                development); the development of new, viable, free societies is much
                                broader and more complex than simply <hi rend="italic">economic</hi>
                                development; the United States values people more than material
                                things, we place our confidence in the liberation of human energy
                                and aspirations through the education of peoples' minds.</item>

                        <p>Incidentally, I saw Adlai in New York on Friday<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d105fn1">April 28.</note> and he feels strongly along the
                            same line.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you and Dean and the President will all ask one key question
                            about the plans for the new foreign assistance program: <hi
                                rend="italic">How new will it actually look and be—as seen by the
                                public—in the coming year, and how much increased emphasis will
                                there really be on human resource development?</hi></p>
                        <p>One final point: It is very important that our accent on education be
                            very visible, even in the organizational structure of the program. If
                            education is buried away in the regional bureaus and there is no
                            provision for a top flight person with a good staff to worry about
                            educational development in the program generally, it will be impossible
                            to attract good enough people into the program to provide strong
                            leadership on the education front, and we will lose an important
                            political advantage at home and abroad.</p>

                                Supplement.</note> I believe they are self-explanatory.</p>
                        <p>Two points really are made. First, that food and agriculture are
                            fundamental to any economic aid program for any developing country. This
                            includes the food, as such, as an element of nutrition and capital
                            investment, and also the matter of technical agricultural development
                            and assistance. Second, the whole matter of how an aid agency should
                            operate is vital we think, and the report of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHRJ1">Labouisse</persName> Committee, in my judgment,
                            is very seriously lacking in a number of respects.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d106fn3">Regarding the <persName corresp="#p_LHRJ1"
                                    >Labouisse</persName> report, see <ref target="#d103">Document
                                    103</ref>.</note> I believe it very important that
                            responsibility be centralized but that operations be specifically
                            delegated to operating agencies. On the surface, these may seem like
                            conflicting principles, but in practice they need not be, and if a
                            program is properly administered it can combine the centralization of
                            responsibility necessary to resolve operating conflicts in the field
                            with the effective operation that will flow from getting the best
                            personnel, together with the resources of the operating department,
                            behind a specific program which has been delegated to that operating
                            department.</p>
                        <p>A third phase of all of this, of course, is the paramilitary and
                            developing extra government organizations, to wit: cooperatives, trade
                            unions, etc. Here I think we again find our greatest opportunity in
                            agriculture and through cooperatives, and it's an area in which I have
                            special interest, having spent a bit of time in some of these nations
                            during World War II.</p>
                        <p>All in all, I'm deeply concerned about this and I desperately hope that
                            no final decision is made until it has been carefully reviewed for a
                            mistake with the resulting conflicting jurisdictions, and competition
                            between agencies I think will be very serious. Our resources are limited
                            and we ought to use them to the best advantage and move in close
                            coordination <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0265"/>and harmony in the
                            same direction. Anyway, do look this over, and I hope you will give me a
                            ring sometime early next week.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Aid message calls for the creation of a single Aid Agency
                            equipped with a flexible set of tools including the Food for Peace
                                Program.<note n="1" xml:id="d107fn1">Reference is presumably to the

                            these basic concepts, the Task Force recommends that an Office of Food

                        <p>This office would, among other things, formulate and negotiate sales
                            agreements with other nations for agricultural commodities under Titles
                            I and IV of PL 480. This would be done after consultation with the
                            appropriate elements of the State Department and other interested
                            agencies. The availability and composition of specific commodities for
                            these sales and their possible effect on usual dollar marketings would
                            continue to be determined by the Department of Agriculture. The
                            necessary authority for putting this function in the Aid Agency is
                            provided for in the omnibus farm bill now before Congress which will
                            amend PL 480 so as to transfer from the Secretary of Agriculture to the
                            President the authority <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0266"/>to

                            in the new Aid Agency on the grounds that it would subordinate the

                                Agency.<note n="3" xml:id="d107fn3">The specific arguments advanced

                            argues that the Congress is more likely to support a reasonably high
                            level for these programs if the present arrangements remain essentially
                            undisturbed. This would leave the initiative for the formulation of
                            sales agreements in the <gloss target="#t_USDA1">USDA</gloss> and the
                            power of final decision in the present interagency committee.</p>
                        <p>The Task Force recommends against the <gloss target="#t_USDA1"
                                >USDA</gloss> proposals because they are inconsistent with the
                            decisions already made by you as set forth in the Foreign Aid message
                            and because they would seriously undermine the country programming
                            concepts fundamental to the new approach set forth in the message.</p>
                        <p>We also believe that the integration of the PL 480 program into the

                            agricultural commodities overseas. The decision-making process will be
                            streamlined under the Task Force recommendation and the Director of the
                            Office of Food for Peace will have the opportunity and responsibility
                            for developing new techniques for increasing the use of these products

                        <p>The above arrangements recommended by the Task Force would assure
                            protection of the interests of both agencies and any dispute between

                        <p>In late March 1961, Charles Burton Marshall began his study of the
                            military assistance program. Marshall had served as a staff assistant to
                            the House Foreign Affairs Committee 1947-1950 and as a member of the
                            Department of State's Policy Planning Staff 1950-1953. Marshall's
                            appointment to write this study derived from agreement among the new
                            leadership of the Department of Defense and Department of State that <pb
                                n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0267"/>the complex economic and
                            political issues might require a different approach to military aid. At
                            an interagency meeting on February 25, Secretaries <persName

                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> discussed the prospect of a study
                            of these issues; see <ref target="#d93">Document 93</ref>. In a March 15
                            letter to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> outlined the parameters
                            for the Marshall study; see <ref target="#d96">Document 96</ref>. In a

                            <item>The exigent questions about military assistance are best
                                understood in relation to the whole situation now confronting the
                                United States. However, necessary, empirical examination of needs in
                                particular areas gives little clue to the answers. The range of
                                opportunity for useful accomplishments is great and varied. The
                                United States might resolve its <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242"
                                    facs="0268"/>will at any one of a number of levels of endeavor.
                                Yet it cannot truly discover its will by poring over figures. It
                                should do so by taking counsel of its aims and the measures of the
                                danger it is in.</item>

                            <item>To put it moderately, that danger is high. The resolution of the
                                United States has increasingly come into question. Adversary forces
                                appear to have the initiative in many sectors. The exigency of the
                                situation has been almost without exception among those consulted
                                during the preparatory stages of this report. No amount of
                                assurances exchanged among themselves, no amount of repetition to
                                others of the firmness of our resolution, can suffice to redress the
                                danger. The essential is to use opportunity—and to create
                                opportunity—to demonstrate resolution by concrete commitments and
                                actions.</item>

                            <item>Military assistance is a channel of action appropriate for that
                                purpose. It is then to be used at the nation's initiative, without
                                requiring concurrence of others. A demonstration now of the
                                intention of the United States not just to hold a line but to push
                                on to required achievements in joint security will serve the United
                                States well. It can stir imagination and heart among those allied
                                with the United States, reassure those under the pressure of
                                uncertainty, and elicit complementary actions.</item>

                                relevant to needs consonant with the purposes of the United States

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Orville</hi>: After your comments to me at
                            Cabinet last week, I gave some further thought to the points you touched
                            upon with respect to the new aid agency and how it should operate, and
                            specifically in reference to food and agriculture programs abroad. I
                            appreciate your giving me your views in greater detail in your letter of
                            May 12,<note n="1" xml:id="d110fn1"><ref target="#d106">Document
                                    106</ref>.</note> and the enclosed copy of your memorandum to
                            the President of May 5.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">See the
                                Supplement.</note> Obviously, all of the questions concerning the
                            new aid agency have not yet been resolved, but an enormous amount of
                            thinking has gone into the plans as they now appear to be shaping up,
                            and I know that the proposals of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHRJ1"
                                >Labouisse</persName>'s Task Force are the product of the best
                            judgments of some very competent people on the basis of past experience
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> and other aid agencies, their
                            analysis of the current situation worldwide, and their assumptions as to
                            the President's own desires as set forth in his Message.</p>
                        <p>Of the three major points made in your letter, I should like to comment
                            first on the one relating to operation of the aid agency. You have
                            suggested that responsibility for aid programs abroad be centralized in
                            the aid agency, but that operations be delegated to those agencies of
                            the Federal Government having the specific expertise and greatest
                            facilities <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0270"/>for the particular
                            functional area involved. It seems to me that what we are really
                            confronted with here is a kind of a perennial dilemma which confronts
                            organization planners, i.e., whether a job can best be done by a
                            comprehensively organized, central organization, or whether it can best
                            be done by a relatively small central group, farming out the operating
                            end to specialized agencies for implementation. As you know, the
                            fragmentation of our aid efforts has been the cause of one of the
                            program's greatest difficulties in the past, and the President's
                            proposal to establish a single aid agency “in place of several competing
                            and confusing aid units” was aimed specifically at overcoming this
                            difficulty. I feel that the President, in calling for a single aid
                            agency, did not contemplate simply a coordinating entity which would
                            develop plans, coordinate and negotiate with other agencies for
                            operation of the program, and then make final recommendations to the
                            President. Since the aid agency must defend the program before the
                            Congress, it would seem essential that it also must take responsibility
                            for the over-all direction and operation of the program in each
                            country.</p>
                        <p>This does not mean, however, that specialized departments of the U.S.
                            Government—Agriculture, <gloss target="#t_HEW1">HEW</gloss>, Labor,
                            Federal Aviation Agency, etc.—do not have an important and vital role to
                            play. I am told that the major existing aid agency—<gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>—makes extensive use of the expertise of
                            the other departments, both in the process of developing programs and
                            their implementation. For example, it is “buying” about $2,000,000 worth
                            of services from the Department of Agriculture, including plant and seed
                            testing, distribution, etc., salinity and soil fertility testing and
                            advisory services, insect control, technical consultation and support
                            activities, preparation of technical guidelines, special publications,
                            and the like. Again, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> is using the
                            Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Yards and Docks to supervise
                            construction projects overseas, particularly road construction projects;
                            is using the Federal Aviation Agency to supervise the installation of
                            navigation equipment in key airports around the world; and it has a
                            “contract” with the National Institute of Health to carry out certain
                            research and development activities in connection with the health
                            components of country programs, particularly with respect to malaria
                            eradication. I am told this list could be extended almost indefinitely.
                            I am sure that the new administration will continue and indeed expand
                            the use of such specialized services.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it seems to me there might well be additional ways in which
                            such Departments as Agriculture and the new aid agency might work
                            together in a common U.S. interest. For example, consideration might be
                            given to a substantially greater exchange of agricultural technicians
                            between the Department of Agriculture and the new agency, with personnel
                            of one from time to time being detailed to the other. Perhaps also a
                            more efficient arrangement could be made so that the new agency <pb
                                n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0271"/>might rely upon the Department
                            to provide it—on a reimbursable basis, if necessary—prompt access to
                            top-notch departmental experts for short-time consultancy. No doubt
                            further conversations between the Department and the new aid agency
                            would uncover still other areas where closer cooperation would be highly
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>As to the other points in your letter—the importance of food and
                            agriculture in economic aid programs abroad, and the use of
                            cooperatives—I am in complete agreement. The meeting of the food
                            requirements of a country is to my mind a matter of first priority.
                            Whether this is accomplished through emergency food programs utilizing
                            our surpluses, or through augmentation of the country's own food
                            production resources, or both, the role of food and agriculture is
                            indeed a primary one. I think it must, nevertheless, be fitted in as a
                            component of the total country program. I believe cooperatives offer a
                            particularly useful potential for providing the first and primary needs
                            of farmers in the developing countries and I know that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHRJ1">Labouisse</persName> shares this point of view.
                            He has, in fact, just recently notified the farm organizations that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> would welcome their assistance
                            in helping to find competent technical advisers and in the creation and
                            development of cooperatives in some of the countries in which we
                            operate. I think it would be very useful for you to solicit the views of
                            the members of your advisory committee as to ways in which cooperatives
                            of the U.S. can assist in the work we are attempting to do in the newly
                            developing countries.</p>
                        <p>Thank you again for giving me your thoughts on this important matter. We
                            are all anxious that the aid program be established on a sound footing
                            that will assure the most effective operation of our programs abroad. I
                            should be happy to discuss this whole matter with you further if you
                            wish.</p>

                                    target="#d110">Document 110</ref>.</note> You have had a great
                            deal more experience with this than I, but I must say that I am fearful
                            that a mistake may very well be made in connection with the nature of
                            the new aid agency.</p>
                        <p>Since receiving your letter I have carefully canvassed a number of the
                            people here in our Department; there are literally hundreds of them who
                            have served in various capacities overseas, many of whom have been
                            involved from the very early days of the aid programs and have operated
                            under different kinds of organizational setup. Without exception, they
                            feel strongly that at the present time and place—and particularly in the
                            under-developed Nations—it is crucial that we do the best job possible,
                            obtain the best people, and have a continuity of operation which can
                            best be accomplished through the medium of our operating
                            departments.</p>
                        <p>It would appear from some of the discussions that we may end up somewhere
                            in between in connection with this with a good deal of delegation in
                            fact, if not in theory. For my part, I have expressed this viewpoint as
                            strongly as I could and I hope it will be recalled; in any event, we in
                            Agriculture are anxious to do a job.</p>
                        <p>I hope as the new agency is launched that you will be able to give it
                            some of your personal attention, Chet, for it will be very important how
                            initial relationships work out. We in Agriculture expect to have in a
                            few weeks an evaluation of some of the key nations in terms of both the
                            use of food and technical assistance in agriculture and also what we
                            think ought to be done. We are anxious to move ahead and prepared to
                            give of our resources in making development programs work in crucial
                            areas around the world. As always, I expect those who are willing to
                            work and have some resources to work with will have a chance to use them
                            and I am assuming that will be the case here.</p>

                            <item>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the
                                meeting by expressing appreciation for the excellent study of the
                                Military Assistance Program conducted by Mr. Marshall. He noted that
                                it dealt with one of the most complex of problem areas. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> stated that it was to
                                be expected that military assistance would be vigorously attacked by
                                the Congress, with members of the Foreign Relations Committee having
                                given notice to this effect. There would undoubtedly be criticism
                                concerning: too great an emphasis in the past on the military effort
                                without proportionate success, of our military aid supporting
                                regimes which cannot survive because of lack of <pb n="248"
                                    xml:id="pg_248" facs="0274"/>popular support; of its effect in
                                projecting a militaristic image of the United States, etc. Despite
                                the foregoing, the Secretary noted that dealing with the Sino-Soviet
                                threat around the globe presented very serious problems which at
                                least in part could perhaps only be met through use of the military
                                aid technique. With this introduction, he asked Mr. Marshall for a
                                brief synopsis of the major points covered by his study.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Mr. Marshall alluded to the fact that his last previous
                                association with the military assistance program was in 1949 when he
                                assisted in the writing of the Congressional Report on the first
                                military assistance program. He thus undertook the current study
                                without prejudice to the past and without compulsion either to
                                endorse or to reject previous policies and programs. Mr. Marshall
                                stated the point of departure for the study represented the enduring
                                aim of U.S. policy, specifically the need for preserving an
                                environment compatible with a continuing vitality of the political
                                propositions summed up in the preamble of the Constitution. He noted
                                that U.S. policy aims vary from one stage to another, were by no
                                means fully subject to our dictate and only in part subject to our
                                influence.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>He then turned to our present circumstances which set the frame of
                                reference for the study. He referred to the fading away of the
                                imperial colonial order which formerly served as the basis of order
                                between peoples of highly different cultures and levels of
                                development living great distances from each other. This together
                                with the heightening awareness of disparities in economic and
                                political equality between states and among various portions of the
                                populations within states, the growth and power of the world
                                communist movement, and the effect of invention and weapons systems
                                having such a redundancy of power as to place them out of all
                                balance with rational political ends, all contributed to the
                                problems with which US foreign policy and military assist-ance as a
                                tool of that policy were required to deal. The general lines of the
                                objective should be to attempt to proceed with a new order
                                reflecting collaboration among juridically free and equal states.
                                This would require a development of communities of outlooks and
                                interests. But it would also require the countering of the military
                                threat and the preventing of communist pre-emptions, whether they be
                                military or political. He noted that it was important to understand
                                that our aims were not logically distinguishable as between the long
                                and short term since all of the undertakings required of us begin
                                now and all carry into the far future. The point is that the
                                objectives of countering the military threat and preventing
                                pre-emptions must be realized if we are to have a chance at
                                developing the new order and developing a community of
                                outlook.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Mr. Marshall then turned to a discussion of the Communist threat
                                with its total claim on the future and on legitimacy related to its
                                version of a law of history which dictated the inevitable triumph of
                                    <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0275"/>its point of view. To
                                pursue its aims the Communists had many assets stemming from its
                                inter-continental deterrent force through its large conventional war
                                making capabilities, to its far-flung underground organ-ization and,
                                indeed, even in its internal organization which permitted a short
                                response time in decision making, a monopoly of information channels
                                and the possession of the revolutionary mantle. For the calculable
                                future the threat would continue. A key point in his study was the
                                recognition that the threat of communism may be expected to
                                continue, restrained only by considerations of prudence relating to
                                countervailing factors. The prolongation of the cold war, however
                                undesirable in itself, is preferable to the alternatives of
                                unleashed violence on the one hand or capitulation on the
                                other.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>As described by Mr. Marshall the threat ranged from internal
                                security through external aggression and over this spectrum there
                                existed a wide range of varying scope and intensity of effort. The
                                requirement for U.S. policy, therefore, was to provide a matching
                                continuity of response, a matching wholeness. Mr. Marshall noted
                                that there did not exist a hierarchy among the options available to
                                us but rather a set of concurrent and linked necessities. There were
                                the needs of internal security in its various forms, beginning with
                                economic development and proceeding through para-military and
                                military forces, to counter guerrilla actions. Similarly with regard
                                to the external threat, there was involved both country military
                                forces and US support, for coping with and deterring limited
                                hostilities, through the series of collective security preparations
                                for local wars, finally into requirements related to US strategic
                                forces. In his statement, Mr. Marshall pointed out that he attempted
                                to classify countries into three major categories: (1) the single
                                threat countries, (2) the double threat countries and (3) the asset
                                countries, i.e., largely <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In
                                considering the situations which affected these various countries,
                                Mr. Marshall found it necessary to put aside the distinction between
                                military and political as not representing a meaningful division.
                                All military assistance programs contain elements of both and to be
                                properly understood must be considered as totalities.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>As to the single-threat countries, these being along the Asian
                                littoral, Africa and Latin America, these were typified by internal
                                political malaise and by being removed in terms of logistic
                                proximity from the Sino-Soviet heartland. Here the root problem was
                                that of a peoples being thrust into modernity without habits and
                                institutions for coping with it. This situation was aggravated by
                                such factors as cultural dislocation, population growth, the power
                                of modern communications, etc. In such situations there was the
                                danger on the one hand of the development of oppressive regimes or
                                of forces gaining an ascendancy having aspirations beyond capacity
                                for fulfillment. In either case, the eventual absorption by the
                                Communists was a clear threat. Military assistance along with <pb
                                    n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0276"/>diplomatic activities,
                                cultural and information programs and assistance in economic
                                development could provide a useful means for dealing with this
                                problem. Military assistance represented one of the ways of reaching
                                significant elements of these societies. Moreover, without the
                                stability provided by military force, economic and political
                                development was not possible. Mr. Marshall found that there existed
                                a concern on the part of many that the development of military
                                forces in these countries would be economically counter-productive.
                                He also noted an opposite tendency on the part of some to believe
                                that the production of military forces was the absolute and sole
                                consideration. In fact, Mr. Marshall found that the relationship was
                                much as a fence to a cornfield where an increase in the acreage
                                planted did not suggest a decreased necessity for fencing or
                                alternatively that it would be a sign of wisdom to put all efforts
                                into the fence and none into the cornfield. The relationship should
                                be mutually supporting. In fact, Mr. Marshall pointed out that the
                                relationship of defense expenditures to economic productivity could
                                be either retarding, neutral or, in some instances, positive
                                depending upon how they influence the growth of capital, labor,
                                skill and technology. In sum, in the single threat countries there
                                was an essential role for military assistance to play: it provided a
                                linkage between military proficiency and other factors, making for
                                success in economic and political development.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>In such countries, Mr. Marshall pointed out there was a high
                                importance to be placed on military assistance in complementing
                                civil responsibilities, i.e. so-called civil action programs. He
                                pointed out that the military assistance program represented the
                                largest exchange of persons activity which we conducted, that it had
                                a direct relation to individuals and groups in sensitive positions
                                within the societies concerned and that the military could and did
                                play an important role in developing and imparting special skills to
                                the society. He pointed to the importance of keeping the role of the
                                military activities and civic action activities in correct
                                perspective. Military activity must be considered as auxiliary but
                                not as a substitute for the civilian components of government.
                                Moreover, it was important that the essentially military character
                                of military forces be recognized. They should be military forces
                                with a civic action capability and not vice versa. He noted in
                                passing that there would probably be certain resistances on the part
                                of the countries to translating their military forces into civic
                                action and police units, particularly as this impinged on the
                                symbolic importance of military forces as a sign of sovereignty.
                                Nevertheless, this was an important objective to be sought with the
                                military forces entering into activities of recognizable utility to
                                the society such as transport, communication, health, sanitation,
                                etc. In doing so, it should be understood that the military forces
                                and thus military assistance was getting very close to the heart of
                                the relationship between regimes and peoples. The requirement
                                therefore was for the closest of coordination <pb n="251"

                                between the political, economic and the military aspects of US

                                not whether we believe that these countries should have armed forces

                                assist-ance. The question is how to best meet the Communist
                                competition in providing such assistance. We have no choice since as

                            <item>Mr. Marshall then turned to the doubly threatened countries,
                                noting that the internal threat posed a situation similar to that
                                described in the singly threatened countries. But in addition, these
                                other countries, in the vulnerable arc from Southeast Asia through
                                the Middle East, by virtue of being adjacent to the Sino-Soviet
                                heartland, were, as indicated by Mr. Khrushchev's own pronouncement,
                                the targets of “legitimate wars”. To such countries, the problem of
                                meeting internal security requirements becomes all the more
                                difficult because of the press of the external threat. None of the
                                countries involved can count on an independent future without US
                                support and each of them recognize this to be the case. The question
                                is how to effect such support which can be effective and persuasive
                                only if manifestly enforceable. In his study, Mr. Marshall discussed
                                the idea of guaranties to such nations which would give them
                                protection of forces from external aggression. Quite aside from the
                                political questions which this involved, he questioned the
                                persuasiveness and effectiveness of such guaranties unless they
                                could be manifestly enforceable. For this condition to prevail
                                indigenous forces were required unless we wished to resort to
                                nuclear weapons which in themselves presented such serious problems
                                as to make their use in such situations of highly questionable
                                utility. Indigenous forces were required for a variety of reasons:
                                To provide perimeter defense; for holding key areas essential to
                                providing points of ingress for US forces; for complementing US
                                forces after deployment; and for fighting a guerrilla action if
                                overrun. Thus Mr. Marshall pointed out that in meshing the local
                                forces with those of the US lies the heart of the joint defense in
                                countries of the vulnerable arc. It was essential that this be
                                reflected not solely in conceptual terms but as a specific reality
                                in US planning.</item>

                                    >NATO</gloss> area. Here he briefly reviewed the essential
                                premises of the Acheson report which he stated he accepted as a
                                point of departure for his military assistance study. He noted that
                                this area represented the base for a relationship with all the areas
                                of the world; without it the US would be at bay in its continental
                                position.</item>

                            <item>With the withering of the nuclear deterrent, there was a necessity
                                for forming a strategy better adapted to the new situation and
                                specifically having greater emphasis on conventional capabilities.
                                To accomplish <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0278"/>this new
                                strategy would require a consensus of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> allies. The cost of the undertaking was not yet
                                defined in detail; however, initial studies indicated an order of
                                magnitude of some additional $20 billion over a five year period.
                                While from a theoretical point of view this was within the economic
                                capabilities of the Europeans themselves, the difficulty was that we
                                cannot deal with situations as if they represented pure economic
                                theory. In fact they turn on a complex of considerations going to
                                the question of public will, strength of governing authority,
                                comprehension and acceptance of new strategy, etc. Mr. Marshall
                                pointed out that an attempt to establish an equitable and feasible
                                formula for burden sharing was a fruitless endeavor. Clearly, both
                                we and the Europeans could do more. One way of looking at the
                                problem was to weigh the alternatives foreclosed by accepting a
                                bigger burden, in other words, who was hurt more by making an
                                additional sacrifice. Here the Europeans might well believe that
                                moving back from cars to bicycles, or bicycles to walking was more
                                of a sacrifice than the Americans would be called upon to make if we
                                contributed more of our resources to the common defense effort. It
                                was necessary to recognize that the US was cast in the role as
                                leader and as exemplar. It would be necessary therefore to combine
                                persuasion with inducement. In order to demonstrate the importance
                                with which the US views the necessity for an adequate <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense, we would have to share
                                in the increased burden of the defense effort. Mr. Marshall
                                described other methods of inducing an increased <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> effort such as US willingness to
                                provide the nuclear support for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss>, the modernization and filling out of US forces;
                                or even an increase in US forces in Europe. While all were
                                significant, none singly nor combined provided a sufficiently rapid,
                                sufficiently dramatic and irretractable contribution to serve the
                                purpose. Mr. Marshall indicated that he would not favor simple
                                unencumbered grants of increased military aid but would tie such
                                assistance to conditions which resulted in specific increases in
                                European defense budgets. This might be left to negotiation through

                            <item>Mr. Marshall concluded his presentation by indicating that his
                                study had suggested that there would be a total requirement, above
                                and beyond the approximate $1.6 level previously requested by the
                                Administration for the maintenance of existing military forces,
                                which would approach three-quarters to a billion dollars annually if
                                the totality of the US national security objectives as presently
                                identified were to be successfully accomplished. This was a need
                                which he foresaw extending for an indefinite period into the

                            <item>The meeting was then opened to discussion. Mr. <persName

                                agreement with Mr. Marshall's report though noting certain
                                reservations. With regard to the value of a US guaranty, Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> stated if it
                                were to be collateralized on certain specifics such as the provision
                                    <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0279"/>of airlift as was
                                contemplated in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, we should
                                be able to exercise a greater degree of control. Secondly, he
                                questioned whether, in connection with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss>, we could not induce an increased effort given the
                                fact that this Administration had withdrawn the previous threat of
                                force reductions left by the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                    >Eisenhower</persName> Administration, had agreed to provide a
                                nuclear submarine commitment and was undertaking a buildup of
                                conventional capabilities of U.S. forces. Mr. Acheson interjected
                                that he agreed with the Marshall study that such inducements as
                                those cited by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName>
                                simply would not be sufficient. There was no question that the
                                Europeans had the requisite economic capability, this was
                                unchallenged. But it was also unchallenged that the military
                                requirement for more adequate forces, particularly with a
                                conventional capability, existed and had existed for some time. Yet
                                this requirement had not been met. We believe the Europeans have a
                                capability for doing more but similarly they believe we could do
                                more. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Acheson pointed out, the
                                requirement will not be met until and unless the US accepts the role
                                of the leader and shows the way. Unless we are prepared to undertake
                                such an action which will mean a greater amount of military
                                assistance for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we shall be
                                left with nice sounding policy statements but without the military
                                forces which are absolutely essential to our own security.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> commented on the
                                inherent “witchcraft” in nuclear weapons where the temptation was to
                                gamble that the threat to employ them will deter war. We have been
                                telling our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies for the
                                last eight years that this was our policy. Now we want them to shift
                                to a more effective conventional buildup and it is difficult to get
                                them to do so. He then turned to Iran, pointing out the difficulty
                                which would ensue in attempting to hold this area against the
                                Soviets. [<hi rend="italic">4-1/2 lines of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>] Mr. Marshall referred to his report stating
                                that he felt Iran to be something of a special case where perhaps
                                lesser numbers and lighter equipped forces might be possible.
                                However, he noted that his study simply was much too abbreviated to
                                permit the careful investigation that this situation would require.
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> challenged the view
                                that Iran was essentially different from other of the doubly
                                threatened areas. In the first place, he pointed out that it was
                                important to attempt to deter the Russians, and in this connection
                                the existence of Iranian forces obviously played a role. The
                                alternative was to have small forces which would clearly increase
                                the pressures on Iran to accommodate to the Soviets. [<hi

                                in Iran, this essentially was a political problem which would have
                                to be solved as best we could but which did not invalidate the other
                                arguments for Iranian forces.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> commented that
                                there was a danger in our commitments not being credible because of
                                our own failure to believe in them <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254"
                                    facs="0280"/>ourselves. In this connection, he commented on the
                                recent Laos history noting how little weight had been given to the
                                fact that we had provided a commitment to Laos which we never really
                                honored. Granting that Laos was a bad place in which to put US
                                troops, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that
                                this was a matter which we knew before we made the commitment. Thus
                                he noted that it was a bad idea to take on a commitment on which we
                                have no intention of following through. If, however, in such places
                                as Vietnam and Thailand we really were prepared to take our
                                commitment seriously and combine our forces with theirs then the
                                resulting situation was a quite different one. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> raised a question as to
                                whether the act of prepositioning US forces didn't gain credibility
                                for a guaranty. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                                agreed that it did and cited an example of Korea. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked Mr. Acheson whether
                                prepositioning of US forces in Iran would not make clear, as was
                                clear with Europe, that we intended to engage the Soviets in the
                                event that an invasion was attempted. Mr. Acheson stated that he
                                thought there was a vast difference between the Iranian and the
                                European situation, primarily because Europe was vital to the U.S.,
                                and Iran, however important, was not. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName>, however, pointed out that a chain reaction
                                could be expected—if we lost Iran. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1"
                                    >Nitze</persName> supported Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName> noting that while Berlin might very well be the
                                key to the North, Iran could be the key to the Middle East and the
                                South. Mr. Hilsman noted that there was considerable significance
                                attached to manner in which an area such as Berlin or Iran was lost.
                                If it is lost through a Munich-type negotiation, the entire alliance
                                structure could be undermined. If, however, it is lost through
                                military action, through being “kicked out”, the result is more
                                likely to be a solidification of resistance to the aggression. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> pointed out that
                                there was a danger of a gradual, step-by-step takeover which moves
                                slowly from neutralism to Communist absorption with each succeeding
                                action being so gradual as not, in and of itself, to warrant
                                counter-military action on the part of the United States.</item>

                            <item>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> questioned as to
                                whether it would not be possible to consider the establishment of
                                priorities in the programming of military assistance which took into
                                account the relative importance of various areas to the United
                                States. We might, for example, cite as a first priority areas needed
                                for the support of the US strategic retaliatory capability;
                                secondly, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which would be on an
                                almost equal plane; thirdly, the Pacific basin; fourthly, the doubly
                                threatened areas; and lastly, the single-threatened areas. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that the
                                biggest threat which we had to face was the political one and that
                                this was true now and had always been the case. As a result, one
                                might with some justification reverse the order of priorities cited
                                by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>. Mr. Dulles said
                                that he wished to comment on the fact that most of the
                                underdeveloped countries could not afford an army, police force and
                                an internal security/<gloss target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss> type of
                                force. He noted that considerable time had been given in the past to
                                considering <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0281"/>this problem,

                                    to present to the Council a report on the status and adequacy of

                                    1957, the National Security Council discussed a progress report

                                consideration was required. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName> noted that a different situation existed in
                                each country even though we had a tendency to try to generalize
                                about them. In returning to the question of priorities, Mr. Marshall
                                questioned whether this was a feasible way to approach the problem.
                                For example, were the requirements for countries in priority one to
                                be completely filled before any attention was to be given to
                                countries in lesser priorities? The problem really was that, if over
                                an extended period we applied an inadequate level of resources, it
                                would be impossible to carry out the policies which were currently
                                stated to be in the vital national interest.</item>

                            <item>In turning to the disposition of the report, Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GRL1">Gilpatric</persName> suggested that a more
                                specific series of recommendations be developed by a smaller group.
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> noted that there were
                                a few questions which were perhaps not completely treated in the
                                report, such as defining how far we go in competing with the
                                Russians. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> returned to the question of
                                priorities, noting that in many of the areas which created great
                                problems of a political nature there was really not much money
                                involved. The real money was required for Korea, Turkey, Formosa,
                                and perhaps Vietnam and Thailand. These together with <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> were where the big dollar signs
                                are. He noted that the Department of Defense planners had developed
                                a draft proposal consistent with the Marshall Report which indicated
                                a resource requirement distribution. He suggested that a working
                                group be established (a) to identify the necessary policy decisions
                                which were required and (b) to show the financial implications of
                                such decision, this job to be completed in the immediate future. Mr.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> indicated that the
                                line organizations of the Department of State and Defense should be
                                ready to review the Marshall paper and proceed with its
                                implementation which might well include requirements for <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> approval. Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> raised the question of
                                balance of payments considerations. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                                pointed out that this was only slightly applicable to military
                                assistance programs since the items procured for the program were
                                procured in the US. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1"
                                    >Fowler</persName> asked about the problem as it related to
                                prepositioning of US forces. Here it was agreed that this could have
                                an important balance of payments impact and that this was a matter
                                which should be identified in any subsequent proposals involving
                                pre-positioning. <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0282"/>Mr.

                                subject of moving the report to a more definitive stage indicating
                                that he thought a paper should be submitted to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. He stated that the Marshall study
                                should be covered by an appropriate transmittal indicating that
                                general agreement had been reached on the study by the Departments
                                of State and Defense. This might then be followed up by a more
                                specific agency development of programming guidance as required for
                                the development of subsequent military assistance programs. Mr.
                                Wilson indicated the need for an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                official sanction of the general policy guidance in order to permit
                                the line organizations to proceed with the detailed programming
                                operation.</item>

                            sessions, which discussed incentives to private capital investment in
                            developing nations and the important role of public investment. The
                            member nations created a working group to prepare recommendations for
                            implementation of the common aid effort, including the issue of
                            equitable sharing of foreign assistance. They also decided to coordinate
                            the common aid effort more closely with the International Bank for
                            Reconstruction and Development and agreed in principle to set up an

                                        accredited, largely on the ground that we are giving it to
                                        other countries.</p>
                                    <p>I said that my principal concern, however, had to do with the
                                        emergency aid provision of the Punta del Este Charter
                                        (Chapter 3).<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">The Charter of

                                            1961, pp. 463-469.</note> I pointed out that this was an
                                        open offer to all the Latin American countries to come in
                                        within 60 days for dollar aid; that it was very unlikely
                                        that such aid could be provided for out of development
                                        lending; that the uncommitted portion of our development
                                        grant fund was earmarked mostly for Africa; and that,
                                        consequently, the emergency aid for Latin America would have
                                        to come from the contingency fund which was already very
                                        seriously depleted. The Secretary indicated agreement with
                                        my concern. I said that I had spoken to Mr. Woodward <note

                                        advising our Latin American missions not to encourage
                                        requests for emergency aid and, on the contrary, to
                                        discourage it.</p></item>

                                <item>I suggested to the Secretary that it was most important for
                                    him to caution all Department officers about making aid
                                    commitments and requested <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258"
                                        facs="0284"/>that he instruct that no commitments be made
                                    without my approval. I also suggested that he advise the
                                    President of the seriousness of controlling our aid commitments.
                                    The Secretary indicated that he would take appropriate action
                                    along the above lines.</item>

                                <item>I then discussed with the Secretary the matter of the Djakarta

                        </list>
                        <p>It is agreed that the first essential in foreign aid is a good boss; and
                            it is agreed that his first job is to strip down the old staff and build
                            a new one of first quality.</p>
                        <p>But given the fact that we have only about six months to create a new
                            look in foreign aid—and to justify the battle for long-term aid—I
                            believe it is also necessary to have a clear substantive strategy; and
                            to move with maximum speed to give it life.</p>
                        <p>I believe the correct strategy consists of giving the highest priority
                            and momentum to two enterprises.</p>
                        <p>First, bringing as many nations as authentically qualify under long term
                            aid arrangements of the kind we now have with India. These are possible
                            candidates: Pakistan, Nigeria, Tanganyika, Iran, Egypt, Formosa,
                            Tunisia, Brazil, and two or three other Latin American nations. These
                            nations now have reasonably respectable national plans, or could develop
                                <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0285"/>them in short order (e.g.,
                            Brazil). With a maximum effort, we could go into Congress next year with
                            almost two-thirds of the population of the underdeveloped areas of the
                            Free World under the new arrangement. The turn-around would then have
                            substance in Congress, quite aside from its wholesome impact on our
                            relations with the other underdeveloped nations.</p>
                        <p>But, second, in order to do this, we must develop consortium
                            arrangements, in which others contribute as well as ourselves; notably,
                            the Germans and the Canadians, who could do more. We must be able to
                            demonstrate to Congress by next Spring not only that the turn-around is
                            more than rhetoric but that, roughly speaking, our development aid is
                            being matched by the rest of the Free World.</p>
                        <p>Technically both objectives are achievable; but the strategy must be
                            understood from the top to the bottom of the government; Gene <persName
                                corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> must cooperate to the hilt, as
                            father of the consortia; <persName corresp="#p_RJW1"
                                >Riddleberger</persName> must push <gloss target="#t_DAG1"
                                >DAG</gloss> as hard as it can be done; you and the Secretary of
                            State, as well as <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and the
                            aid boss, must work over the Germans, Canadians, etc.,
                            unremittingly.</p>

                        <p>On May 25, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            delivered a special message to a joint session of the Congress on urgent
                            national programs. Among the major measures discussed in his message was
                            the importance of military and economic assistance, and he indicated he
                            would shortly submit draft legislation to implement the administration's
                            foreign aid program. On the following day, May 26, he sent identical
                            letters to President of the Senate <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                                Johnson</persName> and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn describing

                        <p>After the House and Senate passed separate foreign assistance
                            authorization bills, a conference committee resolved differences in the

                        <p>In his signing statement, the President said, “I am hopeful that the

                            undertook in enacting this legislation.” The congressional
                            appropriations committees cut foreign assistance, however, and the
                            resulting Foreign Assistance and Related Agencies Appropriation Act,
                            1962, approved on September 30, 1961 (P.L. 87-329; 75 Stat. 717),
                            appropriated only $3,914,600,000 for foreign aid for fiscal year 1962,
                            including $1,600,000,000 in military aid, $1,112,500,000 in development
                            loans, and $296,500,000 in development grants. The total amount was

                        <p>On October 3, 1961, <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler Hamilton</persName>
                            was sworn in as Administrator of the new Agency for International

                            Assistance Act of 1961 specified that a new agency would replace the
                            International Cooperation Administration and the Development Loan Fund
                            within 60 days after enactment of the law. Executive Order 10973,
                            November 3, 1961, specified the terms for the establishment of the
                            Agency for International Development. The Department of State Delegation
                            of Authority No. 104, November 3, 1961, conferred specific
                            responsibilities on the Agency for International Development. Both the
                            Executive Order and the Delegation of Authority were deemed to have been
                            in effect since September 30. For text of the President's remarks at the

                            <item>It appears urgent both with respect to the workings of the
                                government and to the world outside that we clarify the approach we
                                shall take in foreign aid with respect to neutrals and neutralism.

                                American interest in the underdeveloped areas; and to what extent
                                should we try to use aid policy to achieve short-range verbal or
                                voting shifts in alignment on world issues? To put the matter
                                sharply, should we let our aid policy be governed by our interest in
                                the continued independence of these nations; in their absorbing
                                their energies on domestic problems; and in building a long-term

                                policy to be sensitively governed by the positions taken on

                                however, be prepared to make exceptions; but these exceptions must
                                be very carefully weighed, case-by-case, against their cost to the
                                longer strategy. In making exceptions, moreover, we should measure
                                not only the cost but the realistic possibility of achieving a
                                significant change in a nation's policy by the granting or
                                withholding of aid on a short-run basis. We should also consider the
                                technical and legal difficulties in turning aid on and off; e.g.,
                                the Volta project.</item>

                            <item>In short, I believe it possible for us to use aid for serious
                                long-run American objectives with respect to neutrals and, also,
                                occasionally and sparingly to yield a minor tactical gain. But it is
                                crucial that we do not permit our short-term tactics to disrupt the
                                long-term strategy; and this is notably the case because, as the
                                accompanying appendix indicates,<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2"
                                    >Entitled “U.S. and Soviet Aid and the Belgrade Conference”; not
                                    attached and not found.</note> there is reason to believe that
                                the degree of long-term dependence on American or Communist aid may
                                be one significant factor in determining how neutrals align
                                themselves on the major world issues.</item>

                            <item>A possible statement of policy guidance might read something like
                                this: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>"The fundamental objective of American aid is to assist the
                                        less developed nations maintain and strengthen the
                                        foundations of their independence and to improve the welfare
                                        of their peoples. As a general rule, American aid shall be
                                        allocated on the basis of evidence that the governments and
                                        peoples concerned are making serious and sustained efforts
                                        to mobilize their own resources and to create and to
                                        implement well balanced long-term development programs. The
                                        United States government expects other independent
                                        governments to pursue their interests as they see them; and
                                        it does not expect them to agree with American views on all
                                        occasions. But when the views and actions of a government
                                        systematically run counter to vital American interests—and
                                        suggest a basic change in orientation away from a truly
                                        independent stance—this fact will be taken into account in
                                        our aid policy, on a case-by-case basis.”</p>

                            19, and hope to have a chance to see you shortly thereafter.</p>
                        <p>I understand you had an interesting luncheon yesterday with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGGS2">George McGovern</persName>, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> and others. There are market
                            development aspects to certain Title III operations which perhaps serve
                            as one basis for Agriculture's interest in taking them over. Indeed, one
                            of the most effective school lunch programs I have seen is the one being
                            conducted in Lima by the Great Plains Wheat people. However, I don't
                            think it would be feasible for Agriculture to take over such an
                            important aspect of Foreign Aid, driving an illogical wedge into what
                            would otherwise be <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s
                            jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Due to the dual nature of food assistance—that is its economic effect and
                            political importance both at home and abroad—there is an understandable
                            interest on the part of Agriculture which must constantly be recognized,
                            if not always satisfied. That is one of the reasons, I think, why the
                            President created the Food For Peace office, namely to help resolve the
                            divergent approaches of <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, State, and
                            Agriculture toward PL-480 operations.<note n="1" xml:id="d119fn1">P.L.
                                480 was formally entitled the Agricultural Trade Development and
                                Assistance Act, enacted on July 10, 1954. For text, see 68 Stat.
                                454.</note></p>
                        <p>Last spring when legislation was being prepared to create the new <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Agency, there was considerable pressure
                            to remove the Food For Peace office from the White House and merge it
                            into your Commodities Division. This would certainly have compromised
                            our effectiveness as a go-between, and we hope we can still serve that
                            function.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, our effectiveness in “narrowing the gap between
                            abundance at home and near starvation abroad” depends on the emphasis
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is willing to place on food
                            assistance as an adjunct to economic development. We have gained the
                            impression that State and <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> people
                            both in Washington and in the field prefer to deal with dollars than
                            with food. This is due to a combination of factors including the
                            suspicion they have shared with foreign critics that Food For Peace is a
                            “dumping operation”, plus the relative simplicity of handling dollars
                            versus food. But we hope that increasing attention will be given to food
                            aid because, properly administered, it does “reach people”, and help to
                            create an inflation-resistant stability that dollars do not always
                            create. I am enclosing a copy of the talking paper which will be the
                            point of departure for my presentation to the conferees—and which shows
                            what's on our minds these days.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">Not enclosed

                        <p>Following our discussion the other day, I thought it might be useful to
                            put down briefly my views on aid criteria. I do this hesitantly knowing
                            what a difficult problem this is and well aware that my ideas are still
                            very tentative. I hope, however, that in some measure they will be
                            helpful to you.</p>
                        <p>My own experience in OPA during the war convinced me that standards can
                            be made to work if they are reasonably devised and intelligently
                            applied. I think the same lesson can be drawn from our experience with
                            aid to the Philippines after World War II where the Bell mission set
                            down rather rigid criteria and insisted on them.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d120fn1">Reference is to an Economic Survey Mission, headed
                                by Daniel W. Bell, which visited the Philippines July-September 1950
                                to survey the economic situation there and to recommend self-help
                                measures for the Philippines as well as measures for U.S.
                                assistance.</note> The subsequent emergence of Magsaysay was
                            strengthened probably by this insistence.</p>
                        <p>If we do not have firm criteria, we will surely be in trouble on the Hill
                            next year. And in our administration of funds we will be subject to
                            intense pressures without the guidelines we need to discriminate among
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Congress was quite explicit in the law. With respect to the development
                            loans and grants, the President is directed to emphasize assistance to
                            “long-range plans and programs” taking into account “the extent to which
                            the country is showing a responsiveness to the vital economic, political
                            and social concerns of its people, and demonstrating a clear
                            determination to take effective self-help measures”.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d120fn2">The quotations are from the Foreign Assistance Act
                                of 1961. (75 Stat. 426)</note> This injunction is reiterated

                        <p>These three are the essential elements: good planning, an awareness of
                            popular needs, and efficient use of local resources. All of them clearly
                            imply the need in many countries for major reforms in tax systems, land
                            tenure, exchange controls, public administration, and the like.</p>
                        <p>In practice this means that now is no time for “business as usual”. Time
                            is short and the prejudices and vested interests of small elites must
                                <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0292"/>not be allowed to stand in
                            the way of progress. These are days of real crisis. Those who face up
                            realistically to the urgency of democratic change are those with whom we
                            must work most closely.</p>
                        <p>This suggests that we may find it most useful in setting our stand-ards
                            to divide countries into several groups, roughly as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Countries with highest priority should be those taking with
                                    the greatest seriousness the importance of solid planning,
                                    maximum mobilization of local resources, and a dedication to
                                    social justice, and with programs already under way. For these
                                    countries we should take advantage of our five year
                                    authorization to give assurances of long-range
                                    assistance.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>A second category would be countries with the right kind of
                                    ideas on paper but which have not yet carried them out. I would
                                    put these countries on a “short halter”, helping them to get
                                    going by setting target dates and pointing to the aid which they
                                    might get if they bestirred themselves, but holding off on any
                                    major aid until they did so.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The third classification would be countries without even paper
                                    plans and programs. Here our first effort would be to help them
                                    develop the technical competence to take this fundamental step.
                                    It may well be that we should bring outside people right into
                                    the administrative structure of their government, perhaps
                                    through multilateral agencies.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The final group would be countries with such over-riding
                                    military or political problems that we must give emergency aid
                                    without regard to standards. Hopefully these would be only
                                    short-term situations.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Insisting on countries meeting our criteria is going to mean that we
                            shall be turning down many requests for aid. The pressure to give in to
                            these requests will often be intense but the answer, I feel, is not to
                            lower our standards but to find additional inexpensive ways to show our
                            goodwill. For instance, a powdered milk program for the school children
                            of the national capital or a new public health clinic attached to an
                            existing American institution would demonstrate our continuing concern.
                            Some technical assistance and training would be possible. We may want to
                            isolate individual projects which meet our standards, providing aid only
                            to them.</p>
                        <p>In all of this I think we ought to be alert to the importance of
                            publicizing our position. Of course it must be done tactfully but there
                            is enough international agreement now—particularly in Latin America—that
                            it should be easy to quote utterances of the national leaders of
                            recipient countries who have endorsed our views.</p>
                        <p>During my forthcoming visit to Latin America I intend to discuss these
                            ideas with our people in the field. I hope that in so doing I can help
                            sharpen even more our thinking on this crucial problem.</p>

                        <list>

                            <item><p>Rather than distinguish between political and economic aspects
                                    of foreign aid matters, I would stress the relationship between
                                    foreign aid and overall U.S. objectives. These objectives, as
                                    formulated by the Department of State, should be the source from
                                    which stem the aid and other programs which constitute the tools
                                    of U.S. foreign policy. Conversely, the impact of a given tool
                                    on attainment of the over-all objectives should be the main
                                    criterion by which its results are evaluated.</p>
                                <p>I fully concur in the emphasis on country planning which
                                    characterizes the most recent thinking on foreign aid in our
                                    Government. In this connection, I would urge that over-all U.S.
                                    objectives for a particular country take priority as a rule over
                                    general concepts governing the use of our various foreign aid
                                    resources. Such concepts are of course necessary—I appreciated

                                    should be flexibly applied to individual cases.</p>
                                <p>Thus it seems to me that country aid programs should be developed
                                    initially in response to foreign policy guidelines supplied by
                                    the Department of State. Papers endeavoring to give such
                                    guidelines are in preparation for all countries with which we
                                    have diplomatic relations. They are discussed in draft at the
                                    working level in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and you are
                                    given an opportunity to comment formally before the papers are
                                    issued.</p>
                                <p>These guidelines papers are an innovation in Washington and it
                                    may take some time to get them into fully satisfactory shape.
                                    Even then it <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0294"/>may not
                                    always be possible to have a guidelines paper sufficiently up to
                                    date at just the time needed to start a new aid planning cycle.
                                    Hence although I hope the guidelines papers will generally do
                                    the job, procedures should always allow for the possibility of
                                    their being supplemented or replaced by ad hoc guidance,
                                    ordinarily to be given by the State regional bureau
                                    concerned.</p>
                                <p>After projections for a particular country aid program have been
                                    drafted pursuant to the foreign policy guidelines, I think the
                                    program should be further refined by a series of discussions
                                    between State and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> officers
                                    here and in the field, each of whom is aware of the special
                                    requirements of the other's business. The upshot of these
                                    discussions should be a meeting of minds, taking into account
                                    such limitations as the amount of funds probably or actually
                                    available. I assume that the regional bureaus would coordinate
                                    State's side of these discussions in Washington.</p>
                                <p>In some instances of course there will be unresolved differences,
                                    requiring an appeal mechanism. If the appropriate officer in
                                        <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is unable to settle the
                                    point with the appropriate regional Assistant Secretary of
                                    State, I would suggest an intermediate appeal to your Deputy and
                                    the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Only issues
                                    they were unable to resolve would then need to be discussed by
                                    you with the Secretary.</p></item>

                        <p>I concur fully in the belief expressed in your memorandum of October 11
                            that it is necessary to establish clearly the basic decisions, terms of
                                <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0295"/>reference, and level for
                            our aid programs in individual countries.<note n="1" xml:id="d122fn1"
                                >This memorandum on the terms of reference for <gloss
                                    target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> negotiations has not been found,
                                but it apparently was sent to several Assistant Secretaries of State
                                with requests for comments and suggestions on four specific areas.
                                Replies from the Assistant Secretaries of several regional bureaus
                                are ibid.</note> A procedure such as you suggest may well be the
                            most satisfactory approach to this question. In arriving at the
                            determination of the individual elements in this procedure, I believe
                            that we should above all seek to avoid some of the pitfalls of the past.
                            In the first instance, this means being very clear on the meanings of
                            the terms we use.</p>
                        <p>You suggest that a maximum aid level should be established for each
                            country which would be controlling in any aid discussion with the
                            foreign government. I fully share your preoccupations in this regard. We
                            must, I believe, be careful regarding the use of this term “aid level,”
                            and regarding what we include in it. The meaning of the term varies
                            considerably from country to country depending on the kind of assistance
                            each has been receiving from the United States in years gone by. The
                            term has greatest relevance in a country which, in the past, received
                            little from the United States other than Defense Support or Special
                            Assistance grant aid, and would now be receiving predominantly
                            Supporting Assistance.</p>
                        <p>In those relatively few countries which have progressed sufficiently far
                            so that we will in the future be able to make use of our long-term
                            commitment authority in support of their development plans, there may be
                            a commitment of development loan funds in support of the (annual
                            segments of the) development plan, which come close to being an “annual
                            aid level.” Otherwise these funds can be included only on a very rough
                            and preliminary basis.</p>
                        <p>In our new approach, we are to place greatest stress on the totality of
                            U.S. instruments in meeting the development problems of development
                            countries. In some countries it would certainly be quite appropriate to
                            include P.L. 480 and Export-Import Bank loans in the U.S. aid figures.
                            However, except in the Indian type of situation, it is not only
                            impossible to include Exim loans in an “aid level,” but would, I
                            believe, be undesirable.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of what kind of “maximum aid level” you decide is necessary, I
                            believe that we should keep clearly in mind the distinction between a
                            level determined for internal programming purposes, and one which forms
                            the basis for discussions with other governments. The former is
                            necessary if you and your programming staff are to keep control over the
                            funds appropriated annually to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. If
                            you are to maintain control over the program, and maintain your ability
                            to meet constantly changing political as well as development situations,
                            the programming levels must be kept under constant review, particularly
                            in the development <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0296"/>lending
                            field, and cannot be permitted to become “frozen” early in the fiscal
                            year.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of what kinds of provisos we hedge our statements with, any
                            figure mentioned to another government invariably and inevitably becomes
                            the minimum commitment with which we then have to live. If this is the
                            annual allocation to a Supporting Assistance country, this is necessary
                            and acceptable on both sides. To the extent that we really mean to turn
                            over a new leaf in the development loan field, this becomes undesirable
                            except in those few cases where we are making a commitment to support a
                            development plan.</p>
                        <p>With respect to your second and third points, we certainly should have
                            very clearly in mind the specific terms of reference and conditions
                            under which aid commitments would be made and programs conducted. In
                            some cases it may be possible, as you suggest, to prepare a statement of
                            these terms and conditions for presentation to the other government. In
                            some cases, I would imagine that we might be able to secure a greater
                            degree of host government acceptance of the kinds of conditions we would
                            consider desirable if we did not seek to present these in writing as
                            conditions of U.S. aid, at least at the outset. We need to maintain a
                            posture of supporting the most forward-looking elements in the country.
                            We might find, for example, that we encountered intense resistance on
                            the part of the government to reforms which the country team and we gave
                            top priority in the particular country, but that much more progress was
                            possible in another area than had been suspected. This, however, is a
                            question of negotiating techniques. I certainly agree that before
                            agreements with other governments are concluded, there should be a very
                            clear understanding of what the conditions are.</p>
                        <p>There is one further reason for us to maintain a considerable degree of
                            flexibility on maximum aid levels for individual countries. It is most
                            important that we be able to show Congress some progress in getting
                            other industrialized countries to increase their aid efforts and to
                            improve their terms. Whether in formal consortium arrangements such as
                            those organized by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> for India
                            and Pakistan, or whether in far more informal bilateral discussions with
                            other potential donors, we can maintain some bargaining leverage only to
                            the extent that our own position is not frozen in advance. If the
                            recipient country is already fully aware of what we intend to do, our
                            position is frozen.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The more I get into the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> business the
                            more I see that a key obstacle to a <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            turnaround and to frank appraisal of where the US ought to be putting
                            the emphasis in its aid effort is the real fear on the part of
                            ambassadors, country teams, and Washington officials that they will be
                            giving up something for nothing.</p>
                        <p>They argue that if it were really possible to look at the aid to a given
                            country as a total package and to tailor its components for optimum
                            impact, they would happily opt for more economic and less military aid.
                            But they fear that this would not be the case. They claim that if they
                            recommend a cut in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> over the next
                            five years they will simply be denying themselves at least one sort of
                            country leverage without any assurance whatsoever that this will be
                            compensated for in other fields. This is one of the most serious
                            impedimenta to a rational “new look” at the <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>One ambassador said frankly “If I play ball with you and tell you that I
                            feel <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> ought to be cut because our
                            chief problems here are internal and not external, but my colleagues in
                            other countries don't play ball and continue making a big case for both
                            economic and military aid, the result will be that my country takes a
                            cut whereas they continue to get military baksheesh.”</p>
                        <p>A DCM opined that he had for years written justifications for <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> with tongue in cheek because he was
                            fully aware that the military threat was secondary to the internal. But
                            he feared that if he did not, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> would
                            simply be reduced and the country team would lose one form of valuable
                            leverage, without gaining another.</p>
                        <p>A State official complained that if his bureau recommended a cut in
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and a switch of the funds saved
                            into economic aid, the Budget Bureau <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272"
                                facs="0298"/>would accept the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            cut but would argue that an increase in economic aid was more than
                            previous experience showed to be necessary and deny it.</p>
                        <p>I realize all the problems involved in shifting substantial funds from
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to other aid programs. A
                            prolonged educational process will be involved, not least on the Hill.
                            However, unless we can convince all concerned that the objective is not
                            just a reduction of the total aid burden but a redirection of our total
                            effort into areas of real payoff, we're going to keep running into this
                            powerful bureaucratic defense mechanism.</p>
                        <p>The remedy is obvious. We must shoot for greater fungibility between aid
                            accounts and make it stick. Making <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler
                                Hamilton</persName> aid coordinator is an excellent first step,
                            because he will have a vested interest in seeing this done. We should
                            help him by seeking greater transferability between aid accounts, larger
                            contingency funds, etc. We should not let <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> get put into <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            budget. And, in the six country <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            review we should not simply recommend a cut of so much in <gloss

                            should recommend a shift of comparable magnitude into forms of aid more
                            directly attuned to the chief threats we face.</p>

                            U.S. FOREIGN ECONOMIC PROGRAMS</p>
                        <p rend="center">I. Summary and Conclusions</p>
                        <p>Our new approach to foreign economic assistance with its emphasis on
                            self-help and long-range planning represents a major advance in our aid
                            thinking and holds out the promise of more prudent and effective use of
                            our aid funds. No less important it aligns the US with the forces for
                            economic and social progress in the less developed countries.</p>
                        <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0299"/>
                        <p>Because of widely different circumstances in individual countries our
                            self-help approach needs to be flexible and pragmatic rather than
                            doctrinaire. It cannot, moreover, be expected to achieve quick and
                            dramatic results. Self-help must be viewed as a gradual and evolving
                            proc-ess since it is addressed to some of the most deep-seated obstacles
                            to economic growth.</p>
                        <p>Unquestionably we can utilize our aid more effectively to induce
                            self-help than heretofore. We should be careful, however, not to
                            overestimate our capabilities in this regard.</p>
                        <p>Many countries, particularly in Latin America, though they have the
                            capability, have no great sympathy or understanding for self-help since
                            it strikes at the heart of entrenched interests with which existing
                            regimes are identified. Others in the pre-development phase, notably
                            some of the newly independent states of tropical Africa, have only
                            limited capacity for self-help. In still others such as Pakistan, Iran
                            and Turkey overriding US political and strategic interests place
                            limitations on the amount of leverage we can derive from our aid.</p>
                        <p>We cannot expect, therefore, to shift abruptly from a policy only mildly
                            concerned with self-help to a rigid policy of adequate self-help on
                            [and?] no aid. To do so would seriously undermine our relations with the
                            less developed countries and jeopardize vital US strategic interests.
                            Rather we should seek to achieve gradual but steady self-help gains in
                            aid recipient countries, recognizing that sweeping demands for economic
                            and social reform might even be counterproductive.</p>
                        <p>If we maintain persistent pressures for progressive economic and social
                            reforms, the effectiveness of our efforts to move the less developed
                            countries toward long-term political and economic stability will
                            increase correspondingly.</p>
                        <p>Implementation of our new aid approach may be facilitated if we can
                            develop more refined and objective guidelines for judging self-help. One
                            possible approach is to group aid recipient countries according to their
                            stages of economic development and to develop different sets of
                            performance standards for each group. These could then be adjusted to
                            take account of special political and other factors in individual
                            countries within each group.</p>
                        <p>Most important, however, is the need to identify the half dozen at most
                            specific self-help measures we should concentrate our efforts on in each
                            country in order to maximize its economic and social growth. Our
                            assistance gives us only so much leverage in aid recipient countries and
                            we should not dissipate this by scattering our efforts.</p>
                        <p>We as the aid giver are going to have to assume the major burden of
                            persuasion. This will require the most skilled and imaginative economic
                            diplomacy if we are to achieve the full potentialities of our new aid
                            concepts.</p>

                        <p>I have read the reference paper with great interest and found it a
                            valuable discussion of a very complex problem.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d125fn1"><ref target="#d124">Document 124</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>It seems to me that there are certain questions which could serve to
                            clarify our policy and strengthen our notion of self-help.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, will an investment of American aid yield a satisfactory
                                return in results? We do not have resources to waste. There is more
                                to be done than our resources can accomplish. Therefore, we cannot
                                afford bad investments. A temporary amiability on the part of a
                                government receiving aid or the warm feeling which an American
                                ambassador gets by saying “yes” instead of “no” are not adequate
                                returns on the investment of critically scarce resources.</item>
                            <item>Second, under what conditions are we justified in digging into our
                                own taxpayers' pockets and postponing some of the great social needs
                                of our own society in order to render assistance to another country?
                                Can we defend aid to a country which protects its own entrenched
                                interests at a time when we are picking up about 70% of the earnings
                                of corporations in some form of taxation and when personal income
                                taxes range from 20% to 90%? Are we justified in spending public
                                money to provide capital to a country whose own capital sneaks off
                                to Swiss banks?</item>
                        </list>
                        <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0301"/>
                        <p>I do not agree that we, as the giver of aid, must assume the major burden
                            of persuasion on the subject of self-help. The burden of persuasion must
                            be shifted to those who are trying to obtain U.S. resources for their
                            own economic and social development. Clearly, their development is in
                            our interest but we must not let this fact trap us into a responsibility
                            for their standards of living or development.</p>
                        <p>I am not impressed by the thought expressed at our African Chiefs of
                            Mission Conference that if we fail to respond to their economic
                            development needs “our Missions might as well pack up and go home”. To
                            the extent that our ambassadors become dependent upon foreign aid
                            programs, to that extent they become weak and ineffective
                            representatives of American interests abroad. Surely our objective is to
                            work toward an absence of need for American assistance; this means to me
                            that there ought to be a number of countries in which we do not even
                            start down the trail of providing assistance. If we plan to continue to
                            keep going to the Congress for aid programs for 70-80 countries, the
                            Congress and the American public will rebel—and in my judgment that
                            would be right. We ourselves must establish some priorities and work
                            toward some division of labor among the industrialized countries so that
                            every underdeveloped country in the world is not an aid client of the
                            United States. We should develop a special citation or decoration for an
                            ambassador who gets his particular country off our aid list.</p>
                        <p>One possibility for dealing with the above problem is to put certain of
                            our activities on a regional rather than a country basis. For example,
                            we could have a regional program for training indigenous experts without
                            having an aid mission in each country. Private foundations have been
                            doing just that for decades. Further, we could play a regional role
                            (without calling it that) by strengthening certain selective training
                            institutions where young people of neighboring countries could receive
                            advanced training. Further, we might combine this with some regional
                            division of labor in the field of advanced training—somewhat along the
                            lines on which a group of our own Southern States have been working for
                            many years.</p>
                        <p>There are certain matters of self-help on which we should be as
                            uncompromising as possible. I have in mind, for example, the question of
                            graft and corruption. We can afford not to condone it in any way because
                            we know that the elimination of graft is a continuing battle within our
                            own society. Let us not underemphasize the critical importance of this
                            matter; a handful of instances of corruption, with which our aid
                            programs are associated, can blow our entire aid effort right out of the
                            water.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Administrator's Statement.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler Hamilton</persName>, Administrator
                            of the Agency for International Development, first outlined the
                            dimensions of the aid program. The total aid program provides about $6
                            billion for this fiscal year. The $6 billion includes (1) about $2
                            billion for military aid ($1.6 billion for hardware and $400 million for
                            supporting assistance); (2) agricultural aid between $1.5 and $2
                            billion; (3) development assistance, with development loans comprising
                            $1.1 billion and development grants $400 million; a contingency fund of
                            $275 million, and $153 million for aid through international
                            organizations. For the 1,500,000,000 people in the non-Communist
                            underdeveloped countries, the non-military aid of about $4 billion
                            amounts to about $2.70 per capita. Much of this is committed to programs
                            already underway. Hence, the amount available is limited.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> then indicated the
                            kinds of questions which have been put to him since he came on duty.
                            Most of them relate to standards for making grants or loans. How to
                            decide how much is to go to whom for what? The motif of the new program
                            is economic development. Whatever other purposes are expected to be
                            served are supposed to be served as by-products of the process of
                            aid-dispensing and the economic development that takes place.</p>
                        <p>At the hearings before Congress, there were many comments that the
                            program had been confused as to purpose and poorly administered. One
                            reason for confusion is that the purposes of the program have been
                            constantly changing: first, lend lease; then, post-war relief and
                            European reconstruction; next, Point IV technical assistance to
                            underdeveloped countries and defense support in selected places; large
                            agricultural aid starting in 1954; more emphasis on development loans in
                            1958; and now, a new period when we are to support, on a fairly
                            long-term basis, not just specific projects but also political and
                            social reforms which will contribute to economic progress. It is
                            understandable, with the constant change, that people are confused about
                            the aid program. Even those who understand <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277"
                                facs="0303"/>the different kinds of funds are confused as to what
                            they are supposed to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> said that we have to
                            have some standards—both in order to do a useful job and in order to
                            keep the program going (by articulating it to Congress and the
                            public).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> said that his
                            discussion with Mr. Jagan of British Guiana had provided the occasion to
                            apply one sound procedural rule, namely, <hi rend="italic">that we don't
                                discuss money until we have seen a good plan</hi>. Mr. Jagan
                            realized he was the victim of a principle—a procedural principle which
                            he didn't like but which he understood—and therefore we didn't get into
                            a discussion of the merits of his case.</p>
                        <p>But suppose there are satisfactory plans. What standard should we use in
                            choosing among countries? Among projects? One person may say we should
                            teach the blind to read Braille; another will argue that instead we
                            should devote our funds to curing glaucoma. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HF5">Hamilton</persName> asked for comments on what he
                            should use as standards.</p>
                        <p rend="center">DISCUSSION</p>
                        <p>The discussion brought out the great diversity of views that prevail
                            regarding the way the aid program should be handled. In view of the
                            diffuse character of the discussion only selected points are enumerated
                            here.</p>
                        <list>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Danger of Ritual</hi>. There is the danger that
                                countries will develop fairly respectable plans, send a high
                                official to Washington, arrange some kind of a political threat or
                                pressure, and extract an aid commitment.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Broad Character of Basic Objectives</hi>. The
                                basic objectives—political independence (not necessarily an alliance
                                with the United States), political stability, more democratic
                                political institutions, non-Communist orientation, and economic
                                improvement—are too general to provide much help in evaluating aid
                                requests.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Exclusion of Countries Difficult</hi>. Countries
                                that do not receive aid feel that they are discriminated against and
                                the threat to reduce aid drastically elicits talk of a political
                                upset which might turn the country toward the Communists or provide
                                an economic setback. Poor, relatively stable non-Communist countries
                                are likely to be particularly bitter about not receiving aid.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Development Plans</hi>. Countries should usually
                                be required to have development plans. These plans tend to be
                                projections which provide part of the window-dressing required for a
                                grant. Granted the desirability of some kind of plan or projection,
                                at least for Congressional appropriation purposes, refinement of a
                                plan can be carried to useless extremes.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Project vs. Program Aid</hi>. It is often
                                helpful in terms of efficiency to have the aid money directed toward
                                a specific project and it is always <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278"
                                    facs="0304"/>helpful politically to have a project as a symbol
                                of American aid, but a strong case can be made for aid which is not
                                related to a specific project, particularly in connection with a
                                consortium program.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>

                                    Criterion to Apply</hi>. It is frequently said that the money
                                should be put in those countries and in those projects or programs
                                where it will yield the greatest return in terms of increased
                                national output. There is so much uncertainty, however, as to the
                                yields of various outlays, even in strictly economic terms, that
                                this criterion provides no sure guide. Moreover, there are the
                                claims on funds represented by projects or programs already started,
                                unanticipated emergency needs, and the political necessity of making
                                some funds available simply to help keep a sympathetic government in
                                power.</item>

                                do, mainly through the field missions, is to determine whether
                                countries are serious about their plans for improvement and whether
                                they are prepared to do some extra things themselves. The word will
                                get around very fast if countries have only to give lip-service
                                toreform in order to get aid.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Absorptive Capacity</hi>. New and continuing
                                studies should be made of the capacity of less developed countries
                                to absorb productive resources from the outside. It may be that we
                                grossly exaggerate the absorptive capacity of many countries.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>
                            <item><hi rend="italic">Burden Sharing</hi>. The economic capacity of
                                the United States and other relatively developed countries to supply
                                development aid to the less developed countries is probably not the
                                limiting factor at the present time. Arrangements can be made so
                                that aid need not have serious adverse balance of payments effects.
                                The consortium approach provides a device for coordinating aid to
                                particular countries; its effect on the total volume of aid is hard
                                to estimate.</item>

                                particular countries so that he, the Congress, and the public could
                                have a reasonably firm basis for judging the usefulness of the aid

                                in the Aid Program.</hi></p>
                        <p>Mr. Murphy noted the difficult time the Administration had in getting
                            appropriations for aid. On the other hand, authorization for disposal of
                            agricultural surpluses can be obtained without the Administration
                            turning a hand. This brings up the question of what we can do with
                            commodities instead of money in the aid program. He felt that to date
                            the role of commodities has not been integrated very well with country
                            aid plans and thought it would be useful for Agriculture and <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> people to get together early in the
                            planning stage.</p>
                        <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0305"/>
                        <p>Agriculture's part in the aid program is not merely disposing of
                            surpluses. Some commodities will have to be purchased as they are not
                            really in surplus. On cotton, for example, we now have the carry-over
                            that we think there should be. If we want more cotton for PL-480
                            programs, the acreage allotment will have to be increased and the cotton
                            bought for the aid program! Wheat is the principal commodity in
                            surplus.</p>

                            inter-agency Military Assistance Steering Group has considered the
                            principal military, political and economic issues bearing on the
                            utilization of military aid for achieving U.S. objectives in six
                            countries which are major recipients of U.S. Military Assistance. We
                            have sought to determine whether there are feasible alternative methods
                            which, if pursued over the long-run, might accomplish more
                            satisfactorily U.S. objectives and which, in particular, would
                            facilitate a more complementary programming of U.S. economic and
                            military assistance. Our report, designed to establish policy guidelines
                            for military assistance planning, is attached for your consideration.

                                not been found.</note></p>
                        <p>The essence of our conclusions is that, although sufficient military
                            strength must be maintained in these countries to help deter local
                            aggression and to assure internal security, the main thrust of U.S. aid
                            in the next decade should be directed toward repelling the more likely
                            Soviet threat of indirect aggression by furthering economic development
                            and nation-building. Because U.S. and local resources are limited, a
                            redirection of our assistance programs is required which will involve
                            shifting gradually increasing proportions of aid from military to
                            economic programs, a stretch-out of force modernization, and avoidance
                            of the introduction of advanced and sophisticated materiel into
                            countries whose financial, manpower and skills resources are inadequate.
                            While it is clearly recognized that such a program will introduce
                            difficult problems of turnaround, <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281"

                            not be possible in certain countries for political reasons, it is
                            considered most important to establish now the governing policy for
                            program development.</p>
                        <p>As chairman of the Steering Group, I subscribe to the recommendations of
                            the report. It is also endorsed by <persName corresp="#p_KRW2">Robert

                            the Bureau of the Budget participant and Seymour Rubin, the <gloss

                            Defense participant, while subscribing to the general conclusions of the
                            report has entered a reservation regarding implementation of the
                            recommendations for Korea on the grounds that “the alternative totals
                            have no basis in any current analysis” and also that he is “not prepared
                            to conclude that we should alter our basic conception of the mission of
                            ROK forces.” (Tab B) The report itself emphasizes that implementation in
                            Korea can proceed only as our economic aid plans become firm and when we
                            can determine whether increased U.S. conventional capability creates an
                            additional basis for changing force posture in Korea. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> also notes that the Turkish situation is
                            highly uncertain “on the economic front.” I concur with his observation
                            regarding attention which must be paid to increasing problems in
                            obtaining important facilities in Turkey, although I believe that
                            certain proposals known to you will have a more important bearing on
                            resolving these problems than will any given amount of military aid.</p>
                        <p>As noted in the body of the report, the JCS take the position that this
                            is no time to make, nor to plan, reductions in military aid to the six
                            countries. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>, the
                            Special Assistant for Military Assistance Affairs to the Joint Staff,
                            who participated in the group's work, has formally indicated his
                            non-agreement “to reductions in military assistance to be imposed at
                            present or in the foreseeable future.” (Tab C)</p>
                        <p>Our ambassadors in the six countries, supplemented by their <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> chiefs, responded to your letter
                            requesting a reappraisal of the stewardship of U.S. aid in their
                            countries of assignment with briefs generally defending strongly the
                            existing field plans.<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">The responses have not
                                been found.</note> However, Ambassador Holmes was most forthcoming
                            in dealing with a possible reduction in the force structure of the
                            Iranian army provided selective modernization can be effected, increased
                            economic aid can be substituted, and he can indicate to the Shah U.S.
                            aid plans over a five-year period. Ambassador Berger, in a necessarily
                            delayed response, left open the possibility of more far reaching changes
                            in the Korean forces depending on accomplishments and developments
                            measured over the next year.</p>

                            military aid programs. This is presented in four charts at Tab D based

                            program requests and <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss> “low” proposed
                            alternatives. The steering group recognizes these are not firm figures
                            but the best presently available for illustrative purposes, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> figures, especially for 1963,
                            reflect some reductions from previous plans. The charts set forth a
                            six-country total difference of $94 million for 1962 and $151 million
                            for 1963 which the Defense and Budget representatives respectively are

                            some cuts in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 62 and particularly in

                            policy direction, recognize that too sharp a cut immediately would
                            create strongly adverse local political repercussions. We suggest that
                            (a) reductions greater than $50 million from <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DOD</gloss>'s present <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1962

                            be excessive; (b) sharper cuts should be delayed until reallocation of a
                            substantial portion of the “savings” into economic aid programs is
                            feasible; (c) the country teams and unified commands should be given
                            latitude to re-program within the lower ceilings; and, (d) a substantial
                            proportion of the cut in both years should be allocated to Korea, by far

                        <p>On behalf of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> I wish to support the
                            conclusions of the Military Assistance Steering Group. We particularly
                            endorse their view that “the main thrust of U.S. aid in the next decade
                            should be directed toward re-pelling the more likely Soviet threat of
                            indirect aggression by furthering economic development and national
                            building.” It is increasingly apparent that neither the capability nor
                            the will to resist communist aggression and subversion can exist in the
                            absence of satisfactory rates of economic and social development.</p>
                        <p>Present plans call for substantial increases in development assist-ance
                            to this group of countries in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963,
                            particularly for Korea, the Republic of China and Turkey. Planned
                            lending would continue at a high level in Pakistan. In these four
                            countries projected development lending levels appear to be near the
                            upper limit of the effective absorptive capacities of their economies at
                            this time. In the case of Greece and Iran, substantial amounts of U.S.
                            development lending are projected. When combined with other free world
                            assistance and more effective utilization of indigenous resources, it
                            should result in satisfactory progress toward the goal of
                            self-sustaining growth.</p>
                        <p>It is presently planned to reduce supporting assistance levels in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1963 in several of these countries. In
                            every case where this is contemplated, however, increases in development
                            lending will help ease the transition from supporting to development
                            assistance. Furthermore, by directing assistance to long-term
                            development, we enhance the ability of these countries to assume a
                            progressively larger share of the joint defense burden from their
                            increased national product.</p>
                        <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0310"/>
                        <p>Our support of the conclusions of the Steering Group Report is thus
                            already reflected in our planning for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1963. For the longer term we believe a continuing effort should be made
                            to adapt the size and character of the military forces of these
                            countries to the changing nature of the security threats which they
                            face. The Report points up the advantages of an overall approach to both
                            military and economic aid programs which <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> hopes to be able to continue in the future.</p>

                                        certain major country programs. In these reviews, and in
                                        general aid planning, all concerned are to bear in mind that
                                        while we would like to have enough aid to accomplish all of
                                        our military and economic aid objectives, we are likely in
                                        any given period only to get enough appropriations to
                                        accomplish a portion of them. Therefore, we must plan in
                                        terms of which mix of military and other forms of aid will
                                        best serve our overall national security aims. In this
                                        sense, we must recognize that <gloss target="#t_MAP1"

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. The Development Loan Fund was
                            established in 1957 as a means of shifting U.S. economic assistance to
                            the extent possible from a grant to a loan basis and of emphasizing
                            assistance to promote economic development. At the beginning <gloss
                                target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans were almost entirely repayable in
                            local currency in order to avoid burdening the balance of payments of
                            the less-developed countries which in turn would have adversely affected
                            the operation of the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the
                            Export-Import Bank. The <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the
                            Export-Import Bank had been in operation for many years and both were
                            engaged in development financing on terms which have come to be regarded
                            as “conventional,” and which are determined by their sources of lending

                            of the Export-Import Bank. These terms provide for dollar payment,
                            interest at 5-3/4 percent (presently) and maturity based generally on
                            the estimated productivity of the project or generally in the range of
                            15-25 years. Again in 1959 consideration was given to making <gloss

                            the Export-Import Bank. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Eugene
                                Black</persName> objected to substantial dollar repayment of <gloss

                            basis would so consume loan repayment capacity of less developed
                            countries as to make it impossible for them to gain access to private
                            capital or to borrow further from <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>,
                            Export-Import Bank or from other Western country lenders. This view
                            prevailed and <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> credits continued to
                            be generally made repayable in local currencies with maturities
                            comparable to those of <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>; an
                            interest rate of 3-1/2% was provided for economic overhead projects but
                            other lending was generally at 5-3/4%. Such loans were substantially
                            like grants from the point of view of impact on the balance of payments

                            finances of the borrowing countries.</p>
                        <p>The 1961 <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan legislation required
                            repayment in dollars because of the problems inherent in the
                            accumulation of large amounts of local currencies derived not only from
                                <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> loans but from other U.S.
                            programs, such as the very large agricultural surplus sales under P.L.
                            480. Some currencies were being acquired in amounts far in excess of our
                            prospective needs and of their usefulness in further programs in the
                            countries concerned. Moreover, other countries became disturbed by the
                            relatively large accumulation by the U.S. of their currencies. To
                            reverse this trend, then, the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            legislation was established to provide dollar repayment on development
                            lending. Since such lending was to be of greater significance in the
                            future and since the ability of less-developed countries to service
                            dollar indebtedness is generally minimal, it was proposed that loan
                            service terms would be established to impose as light a burden as
                            feasible on the present balance of payments of recipient countries and
                            to permit repayments to be effected over a long term at times when the
                            development efforts of such countries would show greater progress. It
                            was therefore felt that it would be better to obtain a smaller annual
                            service return in dollars than the larger returns in local currency
                            previously in effect. Congress was fully advised and understood that
                            such loans would be made on very liberal terms. For example, in your
                            Foreign Aid Message, it was stated that “the single most important tool
                            will be long-term development loans at no or low rates of interest.”</p>

                                    relatively hard terms as much as one billion dollars—almost
                                    equal to the total <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> lending
                                    authorization. If Germany were to be persuaded to make half of
                                    its loans on relatively hard terms and half on soft terms
                                    comparable to those of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, its
                                    total lending policies would be comparable to ours. It should be
                                    noted that in the case of France, about 85% of French economic
                                    aid totalling over $1 billion annually, mostly to the franc
                                    area, consists of outright grants.</item>

                                    countries. <persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Dungan</persName> added

                        <p>I concur in your proposal in your memorandum of February 9, 1962,<note

                            development lending. Our fundamental purpose in offering these loans is
                            to advance the development of countries who are already mobilizing their
                            own resources extensively, whose needs are great, but whose capacity to
                            repay will come only with the long run development of their national
                            economy. Long term, <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0318"/>low
                            interest loans will allow carrying out many high priority and worthwhile
                            development projects and programs which meet the stiff stand-ards set by
                            Congress and the Executive Branch, but for which financing on
                            conventional terms would be either unavailable or inappropriate.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I agree that we must also retain substantial
                            flexibility in our loan term policies so that we can suit both interest
                            rates and maturities to the individual situation. Countries have
                            different repayment capacities justifying differing loan terms. Some
                            kinds of loans, such as those for private and public revenue-producing
                            projects or for short and medium term economic requirements, should
                            usually be made on terms considerably more strict.</p>
                        <p>As we expand our lending programs, I am concerned that we construct a
                            lending strategy involving foreign assistance loans, the Export-Import
                            Bank, and the Inter-American Bank Trust Fund which builds on the
                            individual advantages and specialties of each agency, and which ties in
                            closely with the international lending agencies. To this end, I would
                            like you to investigate thoroughly the use of consortia as a means of
                            correlating our programs with those of others, and ways by which we can
                            strengthen the organizational and administrative leadership of
                                consortia.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">In a memorandum to <persName

                                said that the other <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> regional
                                bureaus would have to recognize the special position of Latin

                            <item>The paper seems to me good as far as it goes with the exception of
                                one or two minor points which I discuss below. However, it errs by
                                omission in failing to deal with the question of what the mix of
                                loans available to any given country will be. In no country is it
                                likely that all the aid will be given in terms of a single set of
                                loan conditions. Therefore, some countries may in fact be receiving
                                some loan funds on the A basis and other funds on the B
                                basis.</item>

                            <item>5B raises a problem. It appears to imply that development banks
                                and similar institutions in recipient countries must always make
                                loans to private enterprise at “normal” (equal commission?) rates.
                                One of the functions of these development banks is to encourage
                                private investment by making capital available at lower rates. It
                                may be argued that this raises the problem of subsidizing individual
                                entrepreneurs to their personal profit. This is a genuine problem
                                but one which should be met by the tax system of the host country in
                                such a way as to permit re-investment of profits but to penalize
                                high personal consumption out of entrepreneurs' incomes.</item>

                        <p>The President is interested in seeking improvements in the equipment and
                            training of police forces, particularly in the capitals and other major
                            cities, of many of the newly emerging countries to assure that they can
                            maintain order without the excessive use of violence. In addition, the
                            President is interested in having a review made of whether the
                            organizational location of technical assistance on police training
                            should remain under <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> or be handled in

                        <p>The President would like to have you designate representatives to
                            participate in a study of these two questions under the leadership of
                            the Department of State. As a part of this study he would like to
                            include an examination of the police techniques in the United States, in
                            France, Italy and other selected countries to assure that our
                            technicians are aware and take advantage of the extensive police
                            experience in these capitals. In addition, he would like to have the
                            study avail itself of the work already done by the Special Group

                                    <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> No. 146)</note> My purpose
                            in writing is to make available to your committee my personal views on
                            this important matter of improving U.S. organization and techniques in
                            support of police training in foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>In considering the requirements for police-type training abroad, I am
                            first struck by the diversity in the problems of various countries. In
                            some, the primary need may be for crime prevention and routine police
                            techniques such as are found in our city and state police forces in the
                            United States. At the other extreme there are other countries with a
                            requirement for paramilitary constabulary forces of the kind maintained
                            in many Latin American countries to offset the armed forces and to
                            protect the regime against subversion and coup d'etat. Between these
                            extremes <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0326"/>are many gradations
                            which involve activities related to the work of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>, the Army, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Thus, every country tends to pose a special police problem to be
                            diagnosed and resolved by our ambassador with the help of his country
                            team. It is his task to produce an effective program suited to the needs
                            of his country which utilizes all U.S. assets to meet the local
                            situation without concern for departmental lines of jurisdiction. This
                            local plan should represent the best use of U.S. assets to meet the
                            particular indigenous problem.</p>
                        <p>I have no difficulty with this concept and consider that its general
                            acceptance would meet, in principle, the organizational requirements
                            abroad, provided that our ambassadors understand their responsibility
                            and are acquainted with the assets of the various Federal departments at
                            home which can support them. The difficult question is how to deal with
                            these differing country team programs when they reach Washington. They
                            will, presumably, arrive through State Department channels but, after
                            reaching State, they must be sent to some focal point in the Government
                            where over-all responsibility will rest for their implementation and
                            support at the Washington end.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me that this focal point could be in State, in <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, in Defense, or in a newly created
                            agency. As I am instinctively averse to the latter solution except as a
                            last resort, I feel that we should first explore thoroughly the relative
                            merits of the first three solutions. It is this exploration of pros and
                            cons which I would regard as the primary task of your new committee.</p>
                        <p>It might be worthwhile to ask State, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            and Defense to submit separate plans showing how they would carry out
                            their responsibility if this task were assigned to them. Such a plan
                            should include the designation of the key individuals who would be
                            nominated to the principal positions. Of one thing I am quite sure,
                            namely, that the head man must be a strong figure, supported by a joint
                            staff representing <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_FBI1">FBI</gloss>, Defense, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss>. I would prefer to find this individual in <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, but the primary consideration is to
                            get the best man and set him up in the best place to produce results.
                            This pragmatic consideration, I feel, should take precedence over any
                            question of principles with regard to civil versus military control or
                            any related scruple.</p>
                        <p>Please excuse the long letter on the ground that my work in the Special
                            Group (Counter-Insurgency) has aroused a very keen interest in the
                            police training program. I am at the disposition of your committee for
                            any follow-up discussion which you may desire.</p>

                            for political or economic reasons, we can not use the engineers this
                            way. However, he believes that we should take advantage of their skill
                            and excellent reputation wherever possible and that some expansion of

                                Program Coordination</hi></p>
                        <p>The aim of improved coordination between military and economic aid is to
                            enable both programs to be used more effectively in the achievement of
                            U.S. foreign policy objectives. Coordinated programming of military and
                            economic aid requires (a) an assessment of the balance between the total
                            amounts of each (the “mix” problem); and (b) an examination of ways in
                            which each program can support the other, to the maximum advantage of
                            overall U.S. interests (the “side-effects” problem).</p>
                        <p>While the instruments to be coordinated are the dollar aid programs, it
                            is obvious that meaningful coordination requires examination of the
                            effect of dollar aid on the allocation of the larger volume of non-aid
                            resources available within recipient countries, and particularly on
                            their allocation between military and development uses.</p>
                        <p>To improve coordination, it is necessary that there be greater concert in
                            planning the separate programs both in the field and in Washington.
                            Traditionally, the determination of how much should be allocated to each
                            program has usually proceeded by separate consideration of the military
                            and the economic results to be achieved. The combination of military and
                            economic aid received by a country as a result of this procedure <pb
                                n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0329"/>has not previously been subject
                            to significant revision on the basis of an evaluation of total U.S.
                            objectives in the country. Deliberate assessment of the proper balance
                            between military and economic programs is intended to rectify this
                            shortcoming.</p>
                        <p>Coordination between the programs is quantitatively a significant problem
                            in only a small number of countries on the Sino-Soviet periphery (e.g.,
                            Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and Greece),
                            although it is worth noting that these countries receive a relatively
                            large share (about 40 percent) of total U.S. military and economic aid.
                            The problem is quantitatively smaller, but not insignificant, in a
                            number of other countries, (e.g., the Philippines, Morocco, Ethiopia,
                            Indonesia and Burma). It is of negligible significance in the majority
                            of aid-receiving countries in Latin America and Africa. However, even in
                            these countries, there is a potentially important problem that requires
                            serious attention in coordinated aid planning. This problem relates to
                            military sales agreements, financed by official U.S. sources, with
                            countries in which <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> grant-aid may be
                            quite small, e.g., Brazil and Argentina. In some cases, the net effect
                            of such agreements may simply be that “economic” aid funds help to
                            finance purchases of military end-items. In any case, because of the
                            impact which such sales may have on the use by recipient countries of
                            their own resources, and hence on the effectiveness of economic aid
                            programs, it is essential that such sales agreements be given
                            coordinated consideration before they are formally discussed with
                            potential buyers.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Getting the Best Mix Between
                                Military and Economic Aid</hi></p>
                        <p>As mentioned above, I regard the consideration of alternative ways of
                            using various total amounts of U.S. resources in particular countries
                            and regions as essential for comparing the costs and benefits of
                            different courses of action, and thereby reaching better decisions
                            concerning the use of aid and furtherance of U.S. foreign policy
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>Various techniques may be useful for conducting the mix studies as part
                            of the regular process of planning programs in major recipient
                            countries. One technique would require a determination in Washington of
                            alternative “high-low” combinations of dollar guideline figures, for
                            military and for economic programs, to guide the formulation and
                            evaluation by the Country Team of different program mixes. This is the
                            technique which is being used this year in Greece, Turkey and Korea in
                            connection with the program planning for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1964-1968. Another technique would require formulation
                            by the Country Team of a “minimum” and a “preferred” program for
                            military and for economic aid, without specification of dollar
                            guidelines from Washington. Essentially similar analysis and judgments
                            are called for by both techniques.</p>
                        <p>It is also necessary, with both techniques, to examine the effects over
                            time of the alternative aid combinations. In some cases, of which Turkey
                                <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0330"/>may be an example, greater
                            aid allocation to productive investment over a five-year period may
                            permit both more economic growth and a sufficient expansion of
                            self-financed defense outlays to offset some reductions in <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries. Such an outcome would
                            depend on measures to assure that a large part of the resulting
                            increases in output is devoted to reinvestment and to defense financing
                            by the recipient country.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Action Planned:</hi> I plan to make the “mix” exercise
                            a regular part of coordinated planning in the key countries in which
                            both programs are large, and to employ, in different countries, various
                            techniques for assessing the aid balance. In other countries, formal
                            exercises of this sort will not be necessary. However, in countries in
                            which significant military sales are contemplated, a corresponding
                            analysis will be required of the political, economic, and military
                            consequences of differing amounts and kinds of sales transactions,
                            before decisions are made.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Mutual Support Between
                                Programs</hi></p>
                        <p>In addition to the problem of the proper balance between programs,
                            effective coordination requires that the planning of each program take
                            full account of the opportunities that may exist for supporting the
                            other program. Such complementarities may entail indirect benefits, such
                            as the contribution of improved military security toward raising the
                            productivity of civilian investment, or the contribution of economic and
                            social development toward increasing the effectiveness of internal
                            military security programs. They may also entail more direct benefits,
                            such as the contribution of military infrastructures, technical training
                            programs, and engineering and construction battalions toward raising
                            civilian output; or the contribution of civilian transportation
                            investment to improved military logistics.</p>
                        <p>The general implication of such complementarities is that the design of
                            both military and economic programs should take into explicit account,
                            as <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> criteria of choice, the sorts of
                            side-effects that represent benefits of primary importance to the other
                            program. The aim of this effort should be to find, on the military side,
                            for example, a combination of forces, equipment, and infrastructures
                            that is approximately as effective as other possible combinations, in
                            military terms, and yet performs substantially better, in economic,
                            social and political terms. The design of development programs should
                            make a similar effort to take into account, as secondary criteria of
                            choice, those side-effects that may contribute to advancing the military
                            program.</p>
                        <p>These points are not new. The emphasis already placed on civic action in
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> planning guidance, in the recent
                            survey teams, and in the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> formula for funding civic action
                            projects, represents the same approach. But in countries in which the
                            U.S. programs and the domestic <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0331"
                            />defense establishments are relatively large, much more can be done in
                            this direction.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Action Planned:</hi> In revising programming methods, I
                            intend to place greater stress on the role of non-military side-effects
                            as an important element in the planning of military programs, and of
                            military side-effects as an important element in planning economic
                            programs. In all the relevant countries, the Country Team will be asked
                            to indicate the specific meas-ures and projects by which the local
                            military establishment can provide benefits to the civilian economy, and
                            to estimate the value of such benefits that are being and can be
                            provided. The Country Team will also be asked to identify specific ways
                            in which the development program is providing benefits to the military
                            effort. In one or two key countries, pilot studies may be undertaken to
                            see the extent to which the military program and defense establishment
                            can be appropriately used to obtain substantial non-military
                            benefits.</p>

                            the fact that their planning cycles are usually out of phase with each
                            other. The A.I.D. cycle starts about six months later than the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> cycle. This gap gradually diminishes in
                            the next few months, and disappears by March, when both programs are
                            presented to Congress. A gap reappears in the fall when programs are
                            finally approved for execution.</p>
                        <p>The fact that the two program cycles are usually out of phase is not the
                            major obstacle to improved coordination, but it does create problems
                            that interfere with coordination. Probably a greater obstacle has been
                            that the economic programs are usually planned on an annual basis, while
                            the military programs are formulated as part of a five-year plan. The
                            program changes which coordination may require can be more effectively
                            worked out over a five-year planning period than an annual period.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Action Planned:</hi> I am shifting the planning of
                            economic programs to a five-year basis, comparable to the military
                            programs, in countries where it is feasible and desirable to do so. In
                            order to mesh the cycles, I also intend to take the following steps: (1)
                            To consolidate the A.I.D. and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            programming and policy guidances into a single document that would go to
                            the field in February or March of 1963, to guide planning of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965-1969 programs; (2) To request
                            submission by the Country Team of both military and economic plans, as
                            parts of a single country assistance strategy, by early or mid-August of
                            1963. This joint country assistance plan would allow for prior
                            consultation between the Ambassador and the Unified Commander concerning
                            the proposed submission; (3) Beginning in the summer and fall of 1962,
                            to make the inter-agency review of each program a more effective joint
                            effort for identifying issues relating <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306"
                                facs="0332"/>to program coordination, and, beginning in the fall of
                            1963, to hold these inter-agency hearings at about the same time in the
                            cycle.</p>

                        <p>Besides the foregoing suggestions concerning methods of coordinated
                            programming, coordination can be furthered by various administrative and
                            procedural measures. Some of these measures relate to exchanging A.I.D.
                            and ISA personnel in Washington, as well as encouraging a few A.I.D.
                            people periodically to attend key courses at the Military Assistance
                            Institute, and a few ISA and prospective <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> personnel to attend the Institute for International
                            Development conducted by A.I.D.</p>
                        <p>A number of other suggestions have been advanced concerning arrangements
                            that might be made in the field. One of these would establish an
                            assistant director for economic-military planning in three or four of
                            the relevant U.S. A.I.D. missions (e.g., Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and
                            Turkey), and an assistant <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> chief
                            for economic-military planning in several other relevant countries
                            (e.g., Greece, Iran and China). Another suggestion, advanced by the
                            Budget Bureau, is to establish a central, coordinating staff attached
                            directly to the Ambassador to perform essentially the same function. A
                            third suggestion is to establish an A.I.D. advisor, attached to the
                            Unified Command, whose aim would be to bring economic considerations
                            into the process of reviewing <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            plans at the Unified Command level.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Action Planned:</hi> Some of these suggestions are
                            alternatives. Some are mutually supporting. I intend to test in various
                            countries several, and maybe all, of the suggestions relating to
                            organizational and personnel arrangements in the field.</p>
                        <p>In addition to arrangements of this sort in the field, improved
                            coordination requires some modification of organization and procedures
                            in Washington. Organizationally, it requires that A.I.D., besides
                            administering the economic aid programs, strengthen its capacities and
                            procedures for program coordination. For this purpose, the central
                            A.I.D. coordinating staff must be intimately associated with both
                            military and economic programs and must function as an impartial advisor
                            to me to help in carrying out coordinated planning techniques, and to
                            identify issues that require decision by me in my role as program
                            Coordinator. In this connection, I envisage the following coordinating
                            procedure in Washington: (1) In the light of a comparison between
                            alternative aid mixes received from the field, the coordinating staff of
                            A.I.D. would prepare a list of issues, together with its suggestions for
                            resolving them; (2) After suitable inter-agency discussions, including
                            appropriate consultation with the Advisory Group on military assistance,
                            I would make decisions <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0333"/>on these
                            issues; (3) If any objections remained, the Department of Defense could,
                            of course, appeal such decisions to the President.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Action Planned:</hi> I intend to put the above
                            suggestions into effect, as far as possible, in connection with the
                            current Washington review and evaluation of the “mix” exercises on
                            Korea, Greece, and Turkey, and to develop and adapt them for future use,
                            as appropriate. To encourage closer relations between the agencies
                            concerned, I also plan to have periodic meetings of top policy-making
                            officials to consider problems of mutual concern to both programs.</p>

                                    expenditures on the aid account (excluding PL 480 and <gloss

                                    One, use of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> funds for dollar
                                    procurements in third countries. Two, various kinds of

                                    dollars to acquire local currencies. Three, contributions to
                                    international organizations. These amount respectively to $241
                                    million, $690 million, and $149 million. The third item is a
                                    contractual obligation which we cannot control. This leaves the
                                    first two.</p></item>

                            <item><p>Offshore purchases from third countries, as they are called in
                                    the barbarous language of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                                    now come almost entirely from other underdeveloped countries. As
                                    you know, there is a list of 19 prohibited countries, including
                                    all the industrialized countries, from which offshore purchases
                                    are forbidden, except by special waiver. The characteristic
                                    example of what now happens is that, say Pakistan, is allowed to
                                    use dollars to buy steel from India rather than from the U.S. It
                                    is argued by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> that cutting
                                    off this possibility would involve an ultimate loss that
                                    outweighed the gains in immediate dollar savings. First, it
                                    would greatly increase the cost of steel to Pakistan and thus
                                    diminish the effectiveness of our aid proportionately. Second,
                                    it would deprive India of a market which is economically here.
                                    This is more important for India, for whom outlets for her newly
                                    growing industrial exports are a problem, than it is for more
                                    advanced countries. Finally, since India's aid claims are
                                    scrutinized in light of its total flow of foreign resources, the
                                    dollar saving is only transitory. A decrease in India's
                                    opportunity to earn dollars by trade will generate a demand for
                                    an increase in aid, which in substantial part will have to be
                                    met.</p>
                                <p>As you see from the discussion in the attached memorandum, the
                                    major part of the third-country procurement has occurred in your
                                    part of the world.</p></item>

                            <item><p>The larger item which we can try to control is the purchase of
                                    local currencies for dollars, either in the form of budget
                                    support, contracts for local services, direct hire of foreign
                                    personnel, or whatever. An inspection of the figures shows that
                                    this kind of activity is most heavily concentrated in Latin
                                    America and Africa (see Table I of the April 6 memorandum).<note

                                    (a) Many of the countries in these areas do not now possess
                                    adequate governmental machinery for raising funds internally,
                                    whether by taxation or borrowing, and applying them to aid
                                    programs. (b) In these same countries, the will may be as <pb
                                        n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0337"/>deficient as the means.
                                    Our own political interest in getting aid programs started and
                                    in focussing heavily on those programs which are immediately
                                    visible—health, education, and housing, for example—means that
                                    in the absence of means and will for providing local resources
                                    through local means, we must resort to the use of dollars to
                                    purchase local currencies in one fashion or another.</p>
                                <p>As you know, we are now moving, not entirely independently of
                                    stimuli from you, to require that the U.S. funds so used be
                                    placed in segregated accounts which can be spent only in the
                                    U.S.</p></item>

                            <item><p>However, this does not entirely solve the problem. Where a
                                    country has small exchange earnings, where it spends a small
                                    proportion of the earnings in the U.S. in any event, and where
                                    dollar aid is large in relation to the previous flow of exchange
                                    earnings, tying can be relatively effective. This is the case
                                    for some of the smaller Latin American countries. However, it is
                                    not the case for many countries, and especially not for large
                                    countries such as India. It does not seem possible to make such
                                    countries treat all dollar aid as a net addition to their demand
                                    for U.S. exports. It is not, of course, that it is inconceivable
                                    that a mechanism can be found for this purpose. Rather, any
                                    mechanism would require agreement by the country concerned and
                                    acceptance by other suppliers, which I think it highly unlikely
                                    we can achieve. Further, if we could achieve it, it would be at
                                    a cost to ourselves which would negate in large part the very
                                    purpose we seek to attain. In the first place, such restrictions
                                    on purchases from non-U.S. suppliers would be inconsistent with
                                    our attempt to get other countries to bear a larger part of the
                                    costs of providing aid. They, too, could play at the game of
                                    trying to force recipients to spend all receipts in their
                                    currencies directly on their own goods. Second, the countries
                                    themselves would be unwilling to impose so drastic an alteration
                                    in their patterns of supply. If we tried to get them to do so,
                                    we would defeat in some degree the political gains we seek to
                                    achieve by aid. Further, even if these alterations in behavior
                                    were possible, they would take some time to achieve. I am
                                    convinced that it is unwise to treat our balance of payments
                                    problem as if it were a permanent one and alter our fundamental
                                    policies and practices in a long-run way to correspond to a
                                    temporary problem.</p>
                                <p>I do not deny that we can do something more than we have been
                                    able to do in respect to the purchase of local currencies for
                                    dollars, and that there are arguments against this practice
                                    quite independent of our balance of payments difficulties. I
                                    think, however, it is a mistake to view this as a magnitude
                                    which can be pushed down very substantially below its present
                                    level.</p></item>

                            <item>The conclusions I draw from this discussion are twofold: One, we
                                should certainly do as much as we can to see to it that dollar
                                expenditures in connection with aid are only those necessary to
                                achieving the <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0338"/>aims of the
                                aid program. We should do the same in other areas of government
                                expenditure. However, I think we should not expect that this in
                                itself will change the current balance of payments deficit into a
                                surplus.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>What is more important, we should recognize that the problem caused by
                            large foreign holdings of dollar claims that might cause a run on the
                            dollar has only an indirect and not a direct connection with the
                            continuing deficit in our balance of payments. My own judgment is that
                            we have to go further than we have gone in attacking this problem
                            directly. It would be a mistake to focus all our energies on the balance
                            of payments part of the problem and none on those actions which can
                            directly affect the likelihood that foreign holders of dollar claims
                            will try to turn them into gold at a rate which we cannot stand. This
                            memorandum is not the place to argue this point in detail, but I mention
                            it simply to put the matter in proper perspective.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Dungan opened the meeting by saying that he thought the session with
                            the President on Thursday, June 21, was helpful.<note n="2"

                                    142</ref>.</note> However, he said that the President noted
                            certain deficiencies in preparation for that <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313"
                                facs="0339"/>meeting and that there were certain problems concerned
                            with A.I.D.'s presentation. <persName corresp="#p_DRA1"
                                >Dungan</persName> said, in his opinion, that it was unfortunate
                            that facts and figures were not at fingertips when called for by the
                            President. He indicated that the President was unhappy with the
                            inability of A.I.D. to provide information on (a) the follow-up and
                            implementation of loans and projects, and (b) the effect of these loans,
                            grants and projects on balance of payments. <persName corresp="#p_DRA1"
                                >Dungan</persName> stated that nearly all of the questions that the
                            President might ask could have been anticipated and could be anticipated
                            in future meetings.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Dungan</persName> further indicated that at
                            the next meeting A.I.D. officers should be prepared to tell the
                            President what can be done with the existing A.I.D. program to help the

                                </list></note> He indicated that the President is much concerned.
                            For example, he said, was it necessary for the U.S. to provide for local
                            costs, particularly in housing? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFM2"
                                >Coffin</persName> replied that he could understand the President's
                            concern but was not sure that in the development aspect of A.I.D.'s
                            program much improvement could be made vis-a-vis balance of payments
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DRA1">Dungan</persName> was then called from
                            the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Kaysen</persName> agreed that local
                            currency costs were the big problem. But he believed that A.I.D. needed
                            a schedule of what can be done on given amounts of money. He believed
                            that a priority list with costs of each individual item should be
                            prepared so that A.I.D. could present to the President a meaningful
                            schedule of expenditures and what those expenditures would accomplish.
                            At the previous meeting A.I.D. officers were not successful in
                            convincing the President that A.I.D. was able to scrutinize the
                            expenditures in relation to what they accomplished. He cited the
                            Vietnamese matter as an example.</p>

                            officers had strenuously objected to the use of A.I.D. funds for what
                            were essentially military and political purposes. He stated that <gloss

                            step of the way; but that he had been overruled in every instance.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Kaysen</persName> replied that perhaps
                            A.I.D. had not stood up to the pressures and that, in any event, if
                            there was a substantive issue involved here the President should have
                            been informed about it prior to the time a decision was made by the
                            Secretary of State or the Secretary of <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314"

                            been informed, that A.I.D. had been successful in reducing the amount
                            from $25 million to $10 million and that members of the White House
                            staff had informed him that political and military considerations were
                            of overriding importance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Kaysen</persName> then made the point that
                            A.I.D. does not have the internal procedures necessary to substantiate
                            its case and has not, as a general rule, communicated that case
                            effectively to the decision makers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hutchinson commented that in the conflict of military and political
                            considerations on one hand and development considerations on the other,
                            that A.I.D. would never win. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC2"
                                >Kaysen</persName> replied that A.I.D. must nonetheless make the
                            effort and apprise the President prior to the time of a hard decision
                            being made at Cabinet level.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Amory<note n="6" xml:id="d144fn6"> Robert Amory, International
                                Division, Bureau of the Budget.</note> interjected at this point to
                            say that he thought that the A.I.D. officers were correct in contending
                            that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and State must also be made
                            aware of the President's concern over the balance-of-payments
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Kaysen</persName> went on to indicate that
                            at any time A.I.D. funds are expended on programs or projects in which
                            A.I.D. does not believe, the President should be informed. He intimated
                            that the President is not always aware that A.I.D. funds are expended to
                            meet commitments made by the Department of Defense and State. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KC2">Kaysen</persName> then urged A.I.D. officers to use
                            the White House staff to warn the President before the Secretary of
                            State and the Secretary of Defense make decisions involving A.I.D.

                            believed that this presented a problem. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KC2"
                                >Kaysen</persName> replied that these members of the White House
                            staff generally in touch with specific areas could be expected to
                            present the arguments and debate the issues before the President.
                            However, he commented again that the essential problem was that A.I.D.
                            did not have the internal procedures necessary to make clear its
                            position and to inform the President of the effects on the
                            balance-of-payments position of the commitments made for political and
                            military consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CFM2">Coffin</persName> then commented that, if
                            this is the information that is needed, the meeting on Thursday<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d144fn8">June 28.</note> would be too soon. He stated
                            that A.I.D. would have to set up an internal machinery to flag balance
                            of payments problems on each outlay of funds. He instructed PRCS to meet
                                <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0341"/>with the Program Officers
                            of each regional bureau to start work on this immediately. Mr. Gordon
                            commented that it was difficult to estimate the effect on the balance of
                            payments in the first instance of each outlay. In effect, A.I.D. would
                            be telling the President, not only the effects on balance of payments,
                            but whether to aid the country or not, which was essentially a policy
                            matter rather than a procedural one. There followed a brief general
                            discussion of the reply that was to be made to the President's memo of
                            June 22nd.<note n="9" xml:id="d144fn9">The reference should presumably

                            the President what the effects of each loan, grant and agreement would

                        <p>I am greatly disturbed at the apparent lack of control and coordination
                            between our various programs in the international field and our seeming
                            inability to assure that our political objectives are advanced by
                            actions taken by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> or other agencies.
                            I have specific reference to the announcement from New Delhi of the
                            signing of a $250 million loan with the Indians at the very time when,
                            in the United Nations, the Kashmir issue was being discussed and the MIG
                            question was very much a live issue.<note n="1" xml:id="d145fn1">The
                                Soviet Union had proposed the sale of MIG planes to
                            India.</note></p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, I believe it essential that, under the leadership
                            of the Secretary of State, a procedure is developed to guarantee that
                            before any major action is announced, such as an economic or military
                            aid agreement, to explore fully its coordination with our foreign policy
                            objectives. This procedure should precede any action. For example, I
                            understand this week that Chile, Venezuela, Ireland<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d145fn2">The word “Ireland” was inserted by hand.</note> and
                            the UAR all abandoned an agreement that they had to sponsor the Kashmir
                            resolution, leaving us holding the bag. It seems to me that some
                            indication of our displeasure might be manifested by the slowing up of
                            our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> agreements with those countries.
                            Ireland finally came through.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">The last

                        <p>I would appreciate it if you would develop this procedure at the earliest
                            possible time.</p>

                            to expedite response.</p>
                        <p>In recent years I have not believed that we could defend the aid program
                            politically were it “both” a large budget charge and a substantial drain
                            on payments balance. Since aid is an essential offset to our foreign
                            policy we must minimize its impact on payments balance by every feasible
                            means. (As I think you know, this is not a new conviction. I repeatedly
                            blocked proposed democratic-liberal attacks on the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> administration for tying the
                                <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> outlays.) Every step to minimize
                            dollar loss will have some effect on the convenience, efficiency or
                            effectiveness with which aid program is conducted in the particular
                            country. Some damage to objectives of the aid program cannot thus be an
                            objection per se. It is only an objection if the damage frustrates
                            goals.</p>
                        <p>This leads me to comment on three other points in your memorandum before
                            I get on to the main business of what we do, to wit:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>The test of a conserving measure is not as you say on page 3
                                paragraph 5 of your memorandum that it will fail “in itself (to)
                                change the current balance payments deficit into a surplus.” (Indeed
                                I doubt that you meant this should be taken literally. We would both
                                obviously settle for a healthy improvement.) The goal is to make aid
                                as nearly neutral as possible in balance of payments effect. This
                                increases our ability to use this valuable instrument without
                                balance of payment calculation.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>I am distressed by your cautionary references about impairing the
                                principle of multilateralism for an essentially short-run remedy. As
                                we both agree, one of the profound tendencies of the American
                                establishment is to commit itself to fashionable principles per se
                                and not examine their effect and the effect of change on their
                                effect. Multilateralism has worked well in these last years because

                                someone was financing it with large capital exports like ours in the
                                twenties and again in the fifties. Germany, France and Italy can now
                                be multilateral as hell (though not as multilateral as we are)
                                because our deficit eases all the strain and more. But as the

                                    demand including demand for imports. In the absence of internal
                                    planning, in the presence of large differences in incomes and in
                                    the absence of exchange control, these reserves will ultimately
                                    finance imports of consumers goods or services (including
                                    travel) mostly for the comparatively well-to-do or the minority
                                    with American-European consumption standards. There is a nice
                                    question whether we should finance such imports even from United
                                    States. But, as you properly note, from Africa this demand will
                                    flow naturally to Europe. And even South Americans long ago
                                    learned that Parisian brothels are safer, cheaper, more
                                    conveniently located and possibly even more imaginative than
                                    those of New York.</p></item>

                            <item>The first part of the remedy is to accord a highly unpreferred
                                rating to this form of aid. (For schools which you mention our main
                                thrust should be provision of help with books, equipment and teacher
                                training rather than local budget support. Local currency should
                                come where at all possible from local taxes. We should adhere where
                                possible to the old rule that we supply the foreign exchange
                                component.) However, I concede the need for bribing virtue in some
                                cases. And even though we persuade countries to create currency this
                                has the well-recognized effect of expanding demand including demand
                                for imports. We should be willing, <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319"
                                    facs="0345"/>perhaps as a fairly common course, to establish
                                reserves against local currency expansion that is issued for
                                approved purposes. However, we must establish firm rules. These
                                reserves should under all circumstances be held in New York. And it
                                should be part of the bargain that they may be drawn upon only for
                                approved categories of procurement in the United States. At one step
                                this policy reduces the supply of dollars floating around outside
                                and gives partial control over both the place and object of use. To
                                work out these arrangements will be time-consuming and inconvenient
                                and there will, accordingly, be strong arguments against them from
                                men who, naturally, want to get on with the job. Such objections
                                call for sympathy without concessions.</item>

                            <item>There remains, however, the third problem which is that dollars
                                from trade can be easily substituted for dollars from aid. Except
                                where trade earnings are negligible, to tie aid will lead only to a
                                redirection of trade earnings if these customarily go elsewhere.
                                Accruals from the provision of dollar-backing for the currency in
                                the cases just cited can be spending for austere objects that would
                                be required in any case from the United States while releasing other
                                hard currency earnings for the Place Pigalle or for that matter
                                Schneider-Creusot.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Here, however, the problem is no longer peculiar to aid in the form of
                            local currency purchases. It exists wherever aid is combined with other
                            sources of dollars, the possibilities depending on geography and the
                            amount of other convertible currency available for switching to
                            non-dollar procurement. And we must think of this indirect leakage at
                            several levels. A South American country uses tied dollars for
                            essentials in the US and has its untied dollars for elsewhere. India
                            gets aid to cover most of its needed dollar procurement and uses its
                            trade-earned dollars in Germany. Then there is a deeper leakage when
                            India or Pakistan get non-project aid on PL-480 wheat or cotton and thus
                            do not have to curtail purchases in Germany to div up the necessary
                            dollars for these resolute essentials procurable only in the US.</p>
                        <p>The only answer here is a measure of mild bilateralism. Aid being a
                            substitute for American purchases, we must begin to put into all our
                            significant aid agreement provisions against such substitution. The
                            Nigeria formula is in the right direction. I do note the highly
                            unmilitant determination in the aid memorandum—“would appear to require
                            an effective system of exchange control…not always desirable…experiment
                            will be (carefully) observed with a view to (possibly) extending.” And
                            the Nigerian case does not deal at all with what I have called the
                            deeper leakage, i.e., the fact that aid or PL-480 gets free what would
                            otherwise have [to] be bought in the US leaving earned dollars for
                            Europe. Here, and this is most important, we must keep solidly in mind
                            that the colonial world which we have inherited has trade channels,
                            specifications, consumer habits, financial arrangements, and a dozen
                            other ties which <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0346"/>automatically
                            guide trade to the erstwhile European Motherlands. (In India and
                            Pakistan it is infinitely easier to buy from England than elsewhere and
                            where else can you get one where you pull the chair.) To combat and
                            overcome this continuing bilateralism, which it is, we must have
                            responses of our own and the aid leakages make them urgent.</p>
                        <p>First we must formulate a rule. It is broadly that major recipients of
                            our aid—we can safely ignore the de minimus countries and should—should
                            have expenditures in the US as compared with the total in the other
                            industrialized countries that are about in the same proportion that
                            their combined aid and trade accruals in dollars are to the combined
                            accruals from the other advanced countries.</p>
                        <p>This effort should initially be hortatory but no less vigorous for that
                            reason. We can say that, if our costs prove to be seriously higher as
                            the result, we will consider this in the aid allocation. We can afford
                            to spend more for a reduced dollar drain. Note also that at any
                            significant level of development, import controls to stop frivolous
                            overseas use of scarce resources are essential and especially for
                            countries receiving scarce dollar aid. Even in the most primitive
                            country foreign trade is subject to some guidance and we can help.</p>
                        <p>You are wrong, I am sure, in suggesting that such action will invite
                            retaliation. The major European countries cannot apply this rule because
                            they are away ahead of it and for them the use of similar measures is
                            not a matter of abstract principle but of need. On the other hand such
                            pressure by us will encourage the European countries to extend more
                            credits because they will not be financing their trade to the
                            underdeveloped world out of our dollars. You will be interested to know
                            that I broached this line of thinking to both Desai and Jha<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d146fn3"> Morarji Desai, Indian Finance Minister, and

                            before they left on their current hunting trip. Both concede that we are
                            financing their Western European imports, both were deeply depressed at
                            the thought of redirecting their trade and both immediately asked if
                            they could say in their discussions of aid with the Germans and other
                            Western Europeans that the Americans were thinking along these
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>If hortatory efforts do not suffice, the next step would be gentlemen's
                            agreements in negotiation of aid arrangements. Only then something
                            stronger.</p>

                            responsible for administering the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            program how urgently they should pursue the task of holding to the

                        <p>All development loans are now tied to U.S. procurement. A large share of
                            the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> expenditures that create claims
                            against dollars arise from cash grants and local currency purchases.
                            Many of these have in the past been in response to crisis situations;
                            recent examples are South Vietnam and Argentina. I think it would be
                            most helpful if you were to see that the same sense of concern about the
                            balance of payments impact of these programs was transmitted to your
                            geographic bureaus, which must appraise requests for emergency
                            funds.</p>

                            the Export-Import Bank to ask their cooperation in this matter. The

                            only in connection with military aid announcements or actions but also
                            with respect to military sales arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretaries of the geographic bureaus of the Department will be
                            assigned full responsibility for assuring that the full range of

                            to foreign assistance action. A.I.D. Assistant Regional Administrators

                            discharge of these responsibilities, the issue will be referred
                            immediately to the A.I.D. Administrator, <persName corresp="#p_HF5"

                        <p>I am asking each Assistant Secretary to give this matter his closest
                            personal attention and exercise the tough-mindedness required for the
                            advancement of American interests. This involves a high degree of
                            judgment. This process must inevitably involve judgments as to what is
                            in the national interest—both in the short-run and in the long-term.</p>

                            compete with the Standard Oil Company. The Under Secretary said that
                            there had been a request for financing of a pipeline, the foreign
                            exchange cost of which might amount to about $5.5 million. Mr. Sheppard
                            said that he did not wish to take the Under Secretary's time to discuss
                            a problem involving a small amount of money in one country. In a <pb

                        <p>Following introductory remarks by both sides, Minister Scheel opened the
                            discussion by stating that he was anxious to receive Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s comments and suggestions
                            regarding the appropriate magnitudes of aid various industrialized
                            countries might be expected to supply to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s. He pointed out that this subject is of such
                            importance that it must be discussed amongst donors at the highest
                            levels of government.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Federal Republic is concerned, Minister Scheel maintained,
                            fairly successful foreign economic assistance programs have already been
                            launched and are being implemented. The Federal Government faces a
                            number of problems and uncertainties, however, in regard to the future
                            of the German economy and the size and type of foreign aid program it
                            will be in a position to make available from now on. He pointed out in
                            this connection that current German foreign aid cash outlays are made
                            from funds derived to a large extent from extraordinary, non-recurrent
                            sources (proceeds from the sale of Volkswagen shares, etc.), but that
                            future official aid program payments must come almost entirely from a
                            budget which is already overburdened.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>The Under Secretary replied that aid problems, including those related to
                            the need for giving regular consideration to how much economic
                            assistance various countries might provide, will be with us for a long
                            time. We must expect to encounter difficulties in attempting to sustain
                            our aid expenditures. The American and German people may not always be
                            aware of the necessity for maintaining foreign aid programs of
                            sufficient magnitude to do the job that needs to be done. Tangible
                            results from foreign economic assistance usually occur slowly and they
                            may not always be apparent to the public.</p>
                        <p>We will need to discuss aid problems with each other on a regular basis,
                            the Under Secretary stated, and we must keep in mind that matters such
                            as the magnitudes of various countries' aid programs have political as
                            well as economic implications. There must, of course, be a mutual
                            recognition of each country's independence. When the U.S. makes certain
                            suggestions regarding the magnitude of effort the U.S. or Federal
                            Republic might take on as part of the common task, we are in no way
                            suggesting that West Germany is an auxiliary power in this task. We
                            expect to receive suggestions from the Federal Republic, and we are
                            anxious to be of help to the Federal Republic where we can.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel responded that he wanted to assure Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that the Federal Republic does not
                            in any way regard U.S. suggestions as demands. The Federal Republic
                            fully realizes that there is a very important and large job to be done,
                            that it cannot be done by one country alone, and that there must be an
                            apportionment of the effort.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Republic, declared Minister Scheel, does not intend to
                            retreat from the current average level of economic assistance being
                            extended to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. Chancellor
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK3">Adenauer</persName>, Scheel added,
                            committed the German Government to this policy at a recent news
                                conference.<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note></p>
                        <p>The Federal Republic, the Minister went on, is prevented from doing more
                            than this by financial realities. The West German economy is not surging
                            ahead any longer, and so tax revenues are not increasing to the same
                            extent as in previous years. Deficit financing is impossible—the Federal
                            Government must operate within its revenues—the constitution requires
                            it. Given rising defense expenditures, therefore, there are severe
                            limitations on the amount of funds available to the Federal Government
                            for foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>The general guideline for German foreign aid, Minister Scheel explained,
                            will be <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 3 billion, or approximately
                            one percent of gross national product. As gross national product
                            increases, the <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 3 billion annual target
                            will be adjusted. However, the Federal Republic might not <pb n="331"
                                xml:id="pg_331" facs="0357"/>provide exactly this much every year,
                            but will make it available on an average over a period of years. In
                            1961, for example, commitments ran far above <gloss target="#t_DM1"
                                >DM</gloss> 3 billion. In other years, therefore, they can be
                            expected to run under <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 3 billion.</p>
                        <p>Public funds, Minister Scheel went on to explain, will not be sufficient
                            to finance the full <gloss target="#t_DM1">DM</gloss> 3 billion annual
                            program. Consequently, private funds must be tapped for this purpose.
                            Private investment, after all, said the Minister, is usually a better
                            form of aid than public investment. The Federal Republic realized a need
                            exists for both kinds of investment, though, and will provide both.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Development Loan Terms</hi></p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary pointed out that a meeting of minds is necessary on
                            development lending terms. Differences in the terms attached to foreign
                            loans extended by various countries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> stated, can, among other things, create political
                            problems for us. When the U.S. finds it necessary to extend a very large
                            volume of assistance to a particular country “to keep it from going
                            down,” and that country receives loans from other sources on much less
                            liberal terms, the effect is that the U.S. is underwriting the repayment
                            of these other credits. Such situations are obviously difficult to
                            justify.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel answered that maturities for West German long-term
                            development assistance credits have been stretched from 15 to 20 years.
                            Such terms were never heard of in the Federal Republic prior to World
                            War II. Interest rate policy is to charge 3-4 percent for loans
                            connected with infrastructure projects, 4-5 percent on mixed
                            infrastructure-commercial projects and close to German market rates on
                            purely commercial projects. The latter rates, Scheel added, are almost
                            always very far below the market rate of interest prevailing in the
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> requesting the loan.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps one reason U.S. and German development loan terms tend to differ
                            in places, Minister Scheel remarked, is that in extending development
                            assistance the Federal Republic looks primarily at the soundness of a
                            given project and the outlook for its success, while the United States
                            looks primarily at the balance of payments situation of the country.
                            This whole subject of criteria for aid is going to be discussed in the
                                <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>. While the Federal Republic has
                            moved somewhat in the direction of the U.S. position on this question,
                            very significant differences continue to exist between our two sets of
                            criteria.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary pointed out that we are certainly very much concerned
                            about the soundness of the projects we help finance, but we are
                            concerned at the same time that the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                            >LDC</gloss>'s do not pile up debt service burdens that will lead to
                            financial crises.</p>
                        <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0358"/>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s, the Under Secretary added,
                            must be taught financial responsibility. It could be extremely
                            unsettling for <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s to get into the
                            habit of allowing themselves to get into financial trouble in the belief
                            that they will always be bailed out. If we fail to take into account the
                            ability of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s to meet their
                            foreign debt obligations, we are not doing them a service.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>, the Under Secretary suggested,
                            should examine the amortization curves of the foreign debts of the
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s to avoid crisis conditions
                            from developing. The <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> should take
                            into account the ability of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s to
                            increase their export earnings. Unfortunately, many <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s are unfamiliar with export promotion.
                            In this regard, the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> can be helpful
                            in alleviating some of the trade problems facing the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel agreed that the <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> should do these things. He
                            added that in his opinion increased trade is the key to the problem of
                            economic development. It is easier, even if less effective, to give
                            capital to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s than to open new
                            markets for them.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, however, we must be careful, Scheel warned, to see that
                            our investments in the export industries of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s—especially the Latin American <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s—are adequately planned on a worldwide basis. We must
                            avoid investing in the banana or coffee industries of every <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>. Otherwise, we will only contribute
                            further to the flooding of the world markets with such products.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Aid Coordination</hi></p>
                        <p>One piece of unfinished business that lies before us at this time, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated, is the
                            determination of the roles individual Atlantic nations should play in
                            contributing toward the common effort. We can expect the United States
                            to take a leading role in certain places, the Federal Republic can take
                            the lead in other places, and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            can do the same elsewhere. The role of the Federal Republic can be
                            fairly broad, especially since it is unencumbered by a recent history of
                            colonialism.</p>
                        <p>As colonial arrangements were dissolved, the Under Secretary continued,
                            power vacuums were created in many parts of the world. The Federal
                            Republic has considerable freedom of movement throughout the less
                            developed regions which certain other countries possess to a
                            considerably less extent. The question remains, however, just who will
                            do what, where.</p>
                        <p>It is the U.S. view that the <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> can play
                            an especially useful role in this regard. The <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> is still in a very early stage of development. We think
                            it can be improved upon and made a more useful instrumentality for
                            achieving this type of coordination.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel replied that the Federal Republic is willing and anxious
                            to coordinate its foreign aid policies and operations with other donor
                            countries. The <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> seems to him also to
                            be the best instrumentality <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0359"/>for
                            doing this, but he must agree that the <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> is in need of improvement. We have to consider <gloss
                                target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>'s future very carefully. For example,
                            the <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> should be called in at an early
                            stage to help plan development programs for <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s and to decide upon assistance arrangements. The World
                            Bank and the <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> need to cooperate very
                            closely.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel then went on to say that the whole matter of coordination
                            and of reaching decisions about the sharing of responsibilities for
                            development assistance is taken very seriously by the German Government.
                            The Federal Republic may appear particularly sensitive about its role at
                            times—it is a new participant in the foreign aid field and needs to gain
                            experience. The Federal Republic does not intend to escape from its
                            responsibilities, but there are a great many problems to work out
                            concerning the best means of coordinating our activities.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Africa</hi></p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel said he was somewhat concerned regarding our approach to
                            Africa. The Federal Republic feels that, despite the language and
                            ideological barriers which tend to come between Africa and the West,
                            impulses exist which can lead to desirable relationships between these
                            two areas. The nations of the Atlantic Community must take advantage of
                            these impulses, Scheel declared, and help determine future developments
                            on the African continent. This work cannot be left in the hands of
                            international organizations. For one thing, we do not know what the
                            goals of these international organizations may be. We must make our own
                            approaches—only in that way will we know they are being made in
                            pursuance of the goals we establish.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. and the Federal Republic, the Minister said, have no special
                            relationships with particular African countries such as other European
                            powers have. U.S. and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> interests will
                            be served by African economic development. It has been his observation
                            that the more stable African countries are those which are more
                            pluralist in structure, especially in industrial structure. Single
                            industry economies are the least stable. To become economically
                            sovereign the African countries must expand their relations with many
                            other partners.</p>
                        <p>The Minister went on to say that Africa is in need of a long-term trade
                            and development plan. Such a plan should be worked out as soon as the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> joins the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"

                        <p>Minister Scheel expressed the view that the availability of large-scale
                            public capital may be having an adverse effect on the flow of private
                            capital. Public capital should supplement, not replace private capital,
                            Scheel said. The terms assigned to public loans are so much more
                            advantageous to the borrower, however, that enormous efforts are made to

                            Furthermore, countries that have an unfriendly attitude toward private
                            foreign capital seem to feel they can discourage the inflow of such
                            investments and make up the loss by appealing for foreign aid. Scheel
                            described situations of this kind as intolerable.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said that he made a similar point in his speech the
                            week before to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, and added that
                            actions against foreign capital also tend to discourage domestic private
                            investment. The U.S., Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            explained, does not intend to infringe upon the sovereignty of any
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>, but if an <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> is intent upon following a policy of
                            this sort it must face the consequences.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel and the Under Secretary agreed that economic development
                            would be fostered by a freer flow of capital. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that internal savings
                            are insufficient to finance economic development programs in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. These countries are dependent today
                            upon foreign investment capital much in the same way the U.S. was during
                            its early period of development.</p>
                        <p>We are not infringing on the sovereignty of the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            added, if we tell these countries that we have no intention of sending
                            public capital into their economics to do the job that domestic or
                            foreign private capital can be induced to perform. In the past, declared
                            the Under Secretary, we were overly reluctant to make this clear. In the
                            future we should say it, and say it uncategorically.</p>
                        <p>During the first half of this year, the Under Secretary pointed out,
                            there was a net outflow of private capital from Latin America. A
                            development of this sort tends to defeat the economic development
                            efforts being made with public funds.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scheel pointed out that the Federal Republic recently has
                            refused to grant guarantees for investments in Brazil and India because
                            these countries have refused to enter into agreements with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> for the protection of private capital.
                            The Federal Republic would like to see an international agreement
                            concluded on private property protection, but, said the Minister, the
                            U.S. has appeared very reserved to this idea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that the U.S.
                            aid legislation requires us to terminate assistance to countries that
                            expropriate private property without adequate compensation. The Under
                            Secretary concluded by saying that the United States has not taken a
                            doctrinaire position on the advisability of an international agreement
                            such as described by the Minister.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I should like to put in my 2# worth on the choice of a new Director of
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>.<note n="1" xml:id="d154fn1"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler Hamilton</persName> submitted
                                his resignation as <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Administrator
                                on November 10, and he left office on December 7.</note> I know that
                            Dave Bell is not eager to take the job, and his reluctance is a factor
                            that naturally must weigh heavily with you. I wish to argue for
                            appointing him despite it. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is the
                            major positive instrument of our foreign policy; it needs the best man
                            we can get.</p>
                        <p>I think I know enough about the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            program and its problems, and I know Dave Bell well enough to make my
                            observations of some value.</p>
                        <p>As I see it, there are three central tasks in the job: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>To comprehend the purpose of the whole spectrum of aid
                                    activities and relate them to the broader purposes of our
                                    foreign policy, and to articulate this relation in a meaningful
                                    way, both for the agency itself and for the rest of the
                                    government;</item>
                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>To take a firm grasp on the managerial and administrative
                                    problems of the agency;</item>
                                <label>c.</label>
                                <item>To provide Congress with an understandable rationale for aid
                                    expenditures, and to show immediately by argument and then by
                                    performance that there is some relation between spending money
                                    and achieving our objectives.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The three tasks are strongly interrelated. One reason for declining
                            Congressional confidence in foreign aid is the lack of understandable
                            purpose in the program. A succession of administrators has failed to
                            produce a comprehensible account of the national interests served by
                            foreign aid and how the programs they are defending will achieve them.
                            This, in turn, has reflected the difficulty of explaining what they
                            themselves do not understand. Our new emphasis in economic development
                            is important, but economic development as such is only part of what we
                            are doing in <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and the promotion of
                            economic development in every country of the world is not of equal
                            interest to the United States. Generalized blanket explanations of the
                            desirability of progress are poor justifications for particular
                            programs. If <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is organized, operated,
                            understood and explained only as a large collection of individual
                            projects spread over 80 countries, its vulnerability to criticism will
                            remain high.</p>
                        <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0362"/>
                        <p>Dave Bell combines better than anyone in sight the qualifications for
                            doing all three tasks. His previous training and experience have given
                            him both a deep understanding of what foreign aid can and cannot do, and
                            direct practical experience of how it does what it can do. His work
                            within the government has demonstrated his administrative and managerial
                            talents. The difficult double task of relating the conception and design
                            of our aid program to the rest of our foreign policy, and at the same
                            time meeting the radically different operating requirements of running
                            an aid program can be done better by someone who has seen both parts of
                            the task from the inside, as Dave has.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, of course, speak to the question of Dave's persuasive powers
                            with the Congress from first-hand knowledge. He is not a novice: he now
                            has had two years of experience in dealing with appropriations
                            committees. My second-hand understanding is that he has won their
                            respect, as he has won the respect and confidence of everybody in the
                            Executive Branch with whom he deals.</p>
                        <p>The combination of experience and training that Dave brings to the job is
                            such that there would be almost no start-up time involved in his taking
                            over the management of the enterprise. He knows most of the top people
                            and, what is more important, he knows and understands the problems. My
                            own observation of <persName corresp="#p_HF5">Fowler Hamilton</persName>
                            is that, for all his intellectual gifts, he never really did achieve a
                            clear understanding of what he was trying to do. Finally, Dave has the
                            physical and moral energy and drive needed for one of the most demanding
                            and difficult jobs in the government.<note n="2" xml:id="d154fn2"

                            for discouragement in the growing magnitude and complexity of the
                            population problem, and grounds for encouragement in the apparent growth
                            of responsible interest in achieving some kind of an understanding of
                            its nature, and willingness to explore possible solutions. He said that
                            he believed that private foundations and the government had much to gain
                            from exchanging views on this matter, and expressed his gratitude that
                            the Secretary had consented to participate in a meeting for that
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the relationship of population trends to
                            possibilities for improved economic and social welfare was, of course,
                            important. He would be influenced by several prejudices, he said, as he
                            proceeded to discuss the problem with the particular audience he was
                            facing.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, as a former member of the community of foundation
                                    executives,<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">Secretary <persName

                                    Rockefeller Foundation 1952-1960.</note> he would feel
                                particularly sensitive about the impropriety of anyone in government
                                intruding upon the trust which they bore as executives of private
                                foundations.</item>
                            <item>Second, problems posed by population trends were urgent, but other
                                problems were urgent too. He would make no effort to influence
                                foundations' decisions on priorities of urgency.</item>
                            <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0364"/>
                            <item>Third, he was skeptical about the need at this stage of
                                coordination of work in this field. The need was initiation and an
                                expansion of activity in which “everybody could pitch in”.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Secretary said that something like an “explosion” of interest in
                            population problems seemed to be taking place. He believed that the
                            government had had something to do with this. For example, over the last
                            three or four years, there had been a shift from short to longer term
                            planning of programs to meet the needs of aid-receiving countries. This
                            change in approach brought to the fore, for many countries, the
                            importance of taking into account demographic trends.</p>
                        <p>It had been said that five countries in the world now have population
                            policies. It was likely that other countries will be wanting to follow
                            suit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary considered the obvious increase in United Nations interest
                            in the population problem to be a reflection of its members' growing
                            concern with the matter; the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seemed to
                            be moving now from activities of a purely informational character to
                            “action” programs, i.e. technical assistance.</p>
                        <p>United States internal political considerations, the Secretary said, are
                            not really central to the US Government's formulation of ways to act
                            effectively on the population problem. This was not to say, he observed,
                            that population policy was not a sensitive issue. It was. However, it
                            was a sensitive issue in other countries as well, and sensitivities were
                            involved in countries' dealings with each other. The heart of the matter
                            lay in the fact that for quite a few countries rates of population
                            growth seemed to cancel prospects for improvement of economic and social
                            welfare, despite intensive efforts to promote economic development by
                            savings and foreign aid. Economic development is, the Secretary said, a
                            terrifying challenge for native leaders of these countries. Many of them
                            had argued that the growth of strength and prosperity in their countries
                            was frustrated by colonial administrators. With this authority now
                            removed, native leaders must make headway in proving their capacity to
                            show economic and social progress, or be swept aside in favor of others
                            who are promising that they have the capacity to do so by other means.
                            The Secretary declared his continued conviction that less-developed
                            countries can achieve success with free institutions but he recognized
                            that failures could cause resort to alternatives.</p>
                        <p>Addressing himself specifically to what government and foundations can do
                            in this situation, the Secretary dwelt first upon the role of
                            government. Government can help to create and keep alive continuing
                            interest in the relation of population changes to economic and social
                            development. If asked for information, advice, or assistance on
                            population problems, the government can respond to requests. The
                            government can keep in contact with private organizations. It can do
                            more research of its <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0365"/>own. The
                            Secretary's own guess was that the National Institutes of Health would
                            be doing more research. Government needs, however, he said, the stimulus
                            of ideas, and it needs the research which private organizations produce.
                            Government cannot and should not crusade.</p>
                        <p>If and when a foundation develops an interest in the population problem,
                            it should decide for itself which of its phases it is best equipped to
                            take hold of. Foundation experience over the past thirty years or so can
                            cast some light on possible fields of practical activity. There remains
                            much room for expansion of old activity and exploration of new. The
                            Government is not “overwhelmed” by the difficulties which are sometimes
                            associated with the political sensitivities about this problem; there
                            are needed things to be done by both government and private
                            organizations. We need not fear doing them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then threw the meeting open for general discussion. In
                            response to questions from the audience:</p>
                        <p>He replied to Mr. Rockefeller's inquiry about how “communication” might
                            be improved among all those interested in population problems by saying
                            that he hoped that there could emerge a number of centers of information
                            where a pooling of knowledge and of reports about general activities
                            could have some influence on decisions. Dr. Baumgartner (<gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Assistant Administrator for Human
                            Resources and Social Development) expressed the hope that her office in
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> could, over time, serve as
                            another point of contact.</p>
                        <p>Responding to a question by Mr. Kenneth Thompson (Rockefeller Foundation)
                            about the possibility of “Luke” Battle calling a regional conference for
                            Africa, Mr. Barnett (<gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>/ES) summarized the
                            present activities of the economic commissions for Asia and the Far
                            East, Latin America and, specifically, Africa. He observed that it was
                            the Department's view that often effective results were produced when
                            population problems were talked about multilaterally amongst countries
                            with common political, economic, cultural and religious problems. It was
                            desirable, whenever possible, to eliminate the national imprint from
                            information and advice about population problems, and particularly so in
                            Latin America.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stressed the importance for Americans to respond to
                            requests of other countries where population problems were concerned.
                            The US should not advocate specific solutions, and the US Government
                            officially must make clear that any programs which other countries may,
                            by their own decisions, consider to be desirable are, in fact, their
                            own. He mentioned risks of misunderstanding and possible future
                            recrimination which could flow from deviation from these rules.
                            Population, he said, is not a general problem. It is a problem in
                            specific countries and within those countries in specific localities.
                            Factual information should be assembled and scrutinized case by case.
                            The Secretary deplored the use of slogans to cover blanket solutions of
                            problems. He deplored, by way of <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0366"
                            />illustration, the uncritical advocates of undifferentiated “land
                            reform” and said that population problems did not lend themselves to
                            uniform solutions any more than land problems.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary warned his audience particularly of the risk of promising
                            too much to countries which may have asked for help. The awakening of
                            excessive expectations and then their disappointment could set back
                            progress in this field for 20-30 years, he said. Dr. Baumgartner
                            strongly reaffirmed the Secretary's warning not to promise too much.</p>
                        <p>President Heald, of the Ford Foundation, expressed satisfaction at the
                            good relationship which had been established between his foundation and
                            the Department. Mr. Lamont duPont Copeland spoke about the desirability
                            of American efforts to bring the population problem to the attention of
                            “thought” leaders of foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kenneth Thompson, of the Rockefeller Foundation, expressed some doubt
                            that the US political problem was not a greater impediment to activity
                            in the field of population problems than the Secretary had suggested. At
                            the Secretary's request, Mr. Barnett referred to the interest of the
                            National Catholic Welfare Conference in expansion of research on human
                            fertility; Mr. Barnett referred to Pope Pius XII's approval of the
                            “rhythm method” as a technique of family regulation and the Pope's
                            declared hope that science could make that method more secure. There was
                            Roman Catholic interest in other aspects of the demographic problem.
                            There might be wider areas of agreement than was commonly supposed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Baumgartner, speaking personally, said that during a trip last year
                            through the Far East she had observed the difference between frank
                            discussion of medical information on all other subjects and reluctance
                            to talk about techniques of family regulation. She wanted to see this
                            ended, and held out hope that it soon would be.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told his audience that he was certain that there would be a
                            continuing and increasing interest in the population problem.</p>
                        <p>At six p.m. the meeting was adjourned in order to listen to the
                            President's televised press conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d155fn3">For

                        <p>The major <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> objective of furthering the growth of developing
                            countries requires recognition of the long-term need of most of these
                            countries for net capital inflows over a period of years. Apart from a
                            few developing countries with exceptional foreign exchange earning
                            capacity and prospects, the present and prospective debt-servicing
                            capacity for some years to come of these countries is not adequate to
                            permit the whole or major part of capital inflows commensurate with
                            their development needs and self-help efforts to be provided on
                            commercial credit terms. If development needs are financed mainly or
                            largely on commercial or other insufficiently liberal terms, therefore,
                            many developing countries will assume debt burdens that are excessive
                            and others will add further to debt burdens that are already too
                            great.</p>
                        <p>The consequences of excessive debt burden are: creditors are periodically
                            required to roll over or consolidate debt as emergency meas-ures;
                            reasonable and desirable development objectives may have to be
                            abandoned; developing countries are encouraged to adopt lax attitudes
                            towards debt repayment obligations; business confidence may be impaired
                            with a possible resultant decline in private foreign investment; where
                            creditors do not supplement debt rollovers with adequate aid on liberal
                            terms, other donors of grant aid or loans on terms comparable to <gloss
                                target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> terms are placed in the politically
                            awkward and economically unjustifiable position of servicing, in effect,
                            the credits on short term, with high interest or insufficient grace
                            periods of the original lenders.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, in recognition of these problems, several principles and
                            specific actions are proposed below for <gloss target="#t_DAC1"

                            <item>Terms of governmental aid (including grants and loans) should take
                                account of the limited debt-servicing capacity of the developing
                                country, including its present and expected future capacity for
                                effectively using domestic and external capital and the importance
                                of its having available an adequate share of its current and
                                prospective foreign exchange earnings for critical imports.</item>

                            <item>In the case of loans to borrowing enterprises, members should
                                recognize the proper role of interest rates in the allocation of
                                resources within the developing country and provide for interest
                                rates (as well as repayment periods) to the ultimate domestic
                                borrowing enterprise appropriate for the nature of that enterprise.
                                Where the appropriate repayment terms to the lending country, as
                                indicated by recipient country's debt-servicing capacity, differ
                                from the appropriate terms for the enterprise, the donor should make
                                an arrangement to provide for meeting both criteria. (A two-step
                                loan procedure is one way; another which has been suggested by some
                                governments would be to accompany loans on terms appropriate to the
                                project with grant aid to permit debt-service by the government
                                without excessive burden.)</item>

                            <item>Terms of aid should be sufficiently liberal as to allow the needed
                                margin of debt-servicing capacity of the developing country for
                                accepting financing from foreign private sources and international

                                ensure normally a continuing net positive flow of capital from all
                                external sources combined into individual developing

                                recipient countries. In particular, in order to diminish the
                                likelihood of payments crises in receiving countries, donors
                                extending official or guarantied private short term exporter credits
                                should not reduce the level of such credits outstanding without
                                replacement by at least a balancing amount of aid on liberal terms;
                                and in recognition of the need for capital on liberal terms within
                                limited availabilities of external financing, any increases in
                                amounts of such export credits which a donor may provide above
                                present levels outstanding should normally be accompanied by at

                        <p>I think this is basically an incorrect view. I don't quarrel with the
                            proposition that the bulk of our aid ought so to be used. However, the
                            needs of maintaining our position as a world power, and continuing to
                            offer an effective alternative to communism all over the world, require
                            that we maintain some active presence in a great many countries. Aid
                            activity, military or economic or both, is usually the most effective
                            way to do this. I recognize that in many of these countries the
                            activities will produce little visible return, and in some of them it
                            will be continuously difficult to justify because of the political
                            behavior of the recipient governments, e.g., Cambodia or Algeria.
                            Nonetheless, our continued presence is worthwhile. It gives us the only
                            effective channel of influence to these governments. A judicious mixture
                            of military and economic aid is a way of carrying on a continuing
                            relation with two groups that are powerful and important in nearly every
                            underdeveloped country: the would-be economic planners and the military.
                            In every case it is much more difficult and costly to move in on a
                            crisis if we have had no previous contacts than to expand our activity
                            to meet a crisis, when in our judgment this is desirable or
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion of this line of argument is that if we are both to
                            concentrate on successful and well-performing clients and maintain some
                            continuing aid relation with as many countries in the underdeveloped
                            world as we can, especially the countries who are not our allies and who
                            are tempted to swing strongly against us, we may need a somewhat bigger
                            rather than a smaller total aid budget. This might mean $600 million
                            rather than $250 million in the contingency fund. This may appear to
                            vitiate the argument, since it is asking for the moon. On the contrary,
                            I think it states the facts to which the Congress, however reluctantly,
                            must ultimately be persuaded.</p>
                        <p>There is an alternative policy more consistent with the Clay Committee's
                            outlook, but politically much less palatable. This is the policy which
                            accepts the proposition that many countries will, in fact, get strong
                            military and economic assistance from the Soviets, or even some from the
                            Chinese, that they will be loudly leftist and even more loudly
                            anti-Western and that we can safely accept the situation. I think this
                            alternative position is, in any long-term context, even less realistic
                            politically, although perhaps fundamentally sounder.</p>

                            concern with the diffusion of our aid potential and asked that I study
                            possibilities of further concentrating available resources on key
                            countries or regions in concert with other <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> donor countries.</p>
                        <p>The regional bureaus, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> have participated with me in this
                            study. Because of difficulties in obtaining statistics, the inquiry was
                            restricted to economic aid (normally defined as excluding 1-5 year
                            commercial credits) and broken into two parts: 1) Motivations of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> countries (excluding US) in
                            extending aid, together with patterns thereof and possibilities of
                            augmentation and greater concentration; and 2) attitudes of the
                            recipient countries toward bilateral and multilateral aid, together with
                            possibilities of developing a greater accent on “spheres of primary aid
                            responsibility”.</p>
                        <p>The attached memorandum (Tab A) summarizes the available data and the
                            responses of the bureaus and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and
                            draws conclusions and certain operational implications.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">summary of conclusions</hi> reached are that the
                            present pattern of diffusion and bilateralism generally serves US
                                (<gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>) interests, although strict US
                            interests might in some countries (particularly the emergent African
                            states) be served adequately by smaller US aid programs and decreased
                            administrative costs; that although there is a tendency toward diffusion
                            on the part of the new aid donor countries with the most rapid rate of
                            aid expansion (Germany and Japan), possibilities of increasing and
                            concentrating aid outlays by these and other <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> countries (excluding US) exist within available
                            mechanisms and can be exploited where a strong case of advancing
                            national interests is established; that the coordinating group and
                            consortia approaches of the <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>-<gloss

                            are the preferred ones to critical key countries; and that there are no
                            new or promising “spheres of dominant aid responsibility” other than
                            those which now exist (e.g., the dominant roles of the present and
                            former metropoles in Africa and the remaining colonial areas, and of the

                                        efforts are increasing and now constitute almost half of

                                    <p>We should continue to encourage further increases and reduce
                                        our aid correspondingly where this is possible. We must
                                        exert what influence we can on the distribution of aid
                                        extended by others so as to relieve or complement ours and
                                        assure maximum returns. We will be limited, however, in our

                                <item>Except in Africa, the trend of aid in recipient countries is
                                    away from predominance by one donor country or metropole. Even
                                    if we wished to, we are doubtless powerless to reverse this
                                    trend. The remaining dominant “spheres of foreign aid
                                    responsibilities” among the donor nations appear to be
                                    relatively fixed for the foreseeable future. No donor nation is
                                    seeking or would appear willing to accept new “spheres of
                                    responsibility” or to relieve others of dominant aid
                                    responsibilities. It is therefore difficult to foresee how major
                                    aid responsibilities which the US now carries can be shifted to
                                    other donor countries or groupings in any significant magnitude,
                                    although this conclusion may be subject to reexamination as the

                            (say March 28th), and for testimony to begin the following week (say
                            April 2nd).</p>
                        <p>The present report of the Committee is a substantially improved document
                            from last week's version. It contains most of the same critical and
                            restrictive comments, but they are far better balanced by positive
                            support for properly conceived and administration foreign aid
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>With respect to appropriations, the report is not very clear. It says
                            essentially that under the Committee's recommendations, they believe <pb
                                n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0377"/>that “ongoing programs” could
                            be carried on for $500 million less than is now the case. Recognizing
                            present commitments, the Committee does not consider that this much
                            could be cut at once from present fund levels. Furthermore, they
                            recognize that sound programs now under consideration and future program
                            needs will add to the cost of the program.</p>
                        <p>However, the statement is ambiguous enough to give rise to the danger
                            that, either from an oversimplification in press reports or from further
                            comments by Committee members, the $500 million figure in the report
                            will be related to this year's appropriation of $3.9 billion. In that
                            event, the figure of $3.4 billion may assume an unwarranted currency,
                            with the danger of this indicating what next year's appropriation should
                            be.</p>
                        <p>The Committee report in fact expresses no specific views on the <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 appropriation request. The Committee
                            has in effect authorized General Clay to testify on its behalf, applying
                            its general views to the specific conditions of the coming year. General
                            Clay has not thus far given any firm indication of his views on the
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 appropriation level. It is my
                            impression that he may consider that an appropriation in the
                            neighborhood of $4 billion might be a proper level—compared to $4.9
                            billion dollars in the Budget.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The problem before us</hi> now is what specific figure
                            the President should recommend to the Congress in his foreign aid
                            message. There is general agreement that the recommendation should be
                            reduced from the budget figure to reflect some expected carryover of
                            unused lending authority. Together with some recent program changes,
                            this would indicate a figure of $4,756 million (compared with $4,945
                            million in the Budget).</p>
                        <p>The question in my opinion is not whether, but when, to propose a further
                            reduction in response to the Clay Committee's views. There are two
                            principal alternatives.</p>

                                    into effect the recommendations in the report so far as the
                                    President considers it feasible and desirable to do so at
                                    present. I recommend that this be done, and that the President
                                    propose a figure of $4,514 million—$75 million off <gloss

                                    aid, compared to the present (reduced) budget figure. (Attached

                                    clear your expectation that he will support a strong foreign aid
                                    program—and an appropriation as close to your figure as
                                    possible.</p></item>

                                and will communicate with Congress on the subject later. Then, when
                                the Administration witnesses begin to testify, the President could

                        <p>The advantage of this course would be to permit more time to consider the
                            significance of the Clay recommendations. Furthermore it would start the
                            Congressional legislative process with a higher figure, and let the
                            President's reduction in response to the Clay Committee appear to be
                            part of the Congressional process. Since the process would start with a
                            higher figure, Congress could take credit for a larger reduction.</p>
                        <p>The disadvantages of this course would be that it might appear rather
                            artificial and hesitant, and that the President's reduction in response
                            to the Clay report, when it came, might seem rather small ($240
                            million).</p>

                            Bureau of the Budget join in recommending the first alternative.</p>
                        <p>We need to decide between these two courses quickly since our
                            “presentation books” must go to print within the next few days in order
                            to be ready for the beginning of testimony the first week in April.</p>

                        <p>Few subjects have been more frequently considered, reviewed, and
                            evaluated than that of local currencies generated as a result of the
                            sales of agricultural commodities under Title I of Public Law 480.<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d162fn1">Title I of P.L. 480 permitted foreign
                                countries to use their own currencies to purchase U.S. agricultural
                                products.</note> Because these sales run from $1 billion to $1-1/2
                            billion equivalent per year, and account for better than two-thirds of
                            the Food For Peace volume, this subject of the use of local currencies
                            is of major significance in terms of the value of the Food For Peace
                            program.</p>
                        <p>I am firmly convinced that we are using and can use food in place of
                            dollars advantageously in enough instances to make this an item of
                            importance in the solution of our balance of payments problem.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, a negative attitude stemming from the “disposal of surplus”
                            psychology still persists and, it seems to me, restricts our view as to
                            the value of these currencies. It was discouraging to me to see for the
                            first time this morning the section on PL 480 in the preliminary draft
                            of the current study on balance of payments.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2"
                                >Reference presumably is to the study by the Cabinet Committee on
                                Balance of Payments. See <ref target="#d10">Document
                                10</ref>.</note> I believe the approach here again reflects a
                            basically negative attitude. The implication is that PL 480 hurts normal
                            commercial sales and hence adversely affects our dollar position. From
                            our experience over the last eight years, I do not think this is a
                            justified position.</p>
                        <p>The savings indicated in the current study would be something over $50
                            million. With a more imaginative approach to the balance of payments
                            issue, I believe we can significantly increase this saving.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, we are using food in place of dollars to generate local
                            currency for U.S. needs. Last year we “saved” more than $150 million by
                            using these currencies in place of appropriated dollars. By deliberately
                            “selling” food in countries where we have currency needs we should be
                            able to double this figure within a year.</p>

                        <p>In addition there are indirect savings. “Cooley” loans<note n="3"

                            outflow by the private sector without stopping our overseas expansion.
                            Economic development loans and military support items, to some degree,
                            are also factors that can and do minimize dollar use while maintaining
                            approved programs. There are distinct limitations but we have not yet
                            reached these limitations.</p>
                        <p>Actually, the overall use of food in place of the dollars that would

                                Supplement.</note> We are talking of potentially big figures and
                            this, it seems to us, justifies further study.</p>
                        <p>Since the establishment of P.L. 480, we have generated almost $6 billion
                            equivalent in some 44 different currencies, and have disbursed, through
                            last June 30, somewhat over $3 billion equivalent. A quick review of
                            current reports indicates that at the present time, we have in the U.S.
                            Treasury the equivalent of more than $2 billion in unexpended local
                            currencies. A new approach we are presently studying may have a
                            short-run dollar saving of some significance. While those Treasury local
                            currency holdings are allocated, many of the funds (i.e., Reserves for
                            program adjustments, market development funds, etc.) may not be
                            dispersed for one or more years. We might consider “borrowing” these
                            local currencies where U.S.-use amounts are not adequate for present
                            U.S. needs. Paraguay, Greece and Chile are three countries that
                            immediately come to mind where such action would save dollars
                            immediately. Careful programming could replace many of these allocations
                            with newly-generated local currencies which would then mean a permanent
                            saving of the dollars.</p>

                            economic penetration into Bolivia as an example—about Communist bloc
                            economic offensives in less developed countries. The Department has
                            carefully examined the proposal that the United States take measures to
                            forestall the communist countries from providing, on an aid basis,
                            consumer goods to less developed countries. The dangers of penetration
                            through such offensives, which you very correctly point out, are not,
                            unfortunately, presently recognized by some of the less developed
                            countries. Until that recognition exists we will not be able to
                            forestall the acceptance of aid from the Communist bloc and if the
                            attempt were made as suggested, we would be put in the position of
                            reacting to every communist initiative.</p>
                        <p>We have consistently pointed out to the developing countries the “hidden
                            strings” which are invariably attached to bloc offers. Unless the
                            governments of the less developed countries can be convinced of the
                            dangers of subversion resulting from an acceptance of bloc aid, any
                            increases in United States aid which are aimed at precluding bloc
                            economic penetration would instead act merely as supplements to bloc aid
                            and would not eliminate the problems.</p>
                        <p>We believe that our approach, together with the unfortunate experience
                            that some developing nations have had with bloc trade and assist-ance,
                            is paying dividends. In Africa, for example, the launching of our aid
                            program has helped to convince the Sekou Toure Government of Guinea that
                            there is a successful alternative to dependence upon Soviet bloc aid. In
                            Latin America, there is increasing evidence that the goals of the
                            Alliance for Progress are gaining acceptance and genuine understanding
                            is growing of the fact that the United States is sincerely interested in
                            the problems of her neighbors to the South. Despite Bolivia's past
                            acceptance of Czech aid, there is resistance to the acceptance of future
                            offers.</p>
                        <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>Under our present foreign aid legislation American suppliers can sell
                            their products to importers in aid-receiving countries with the United
                            States Government paying the American exporter in dollars and, in the
                            case of grant assistance, the foreign government depositing local
                            currencies received from importers to a counterpart account. The
                            commodities made available through our various programs include surplus
                            agricultural commodities, a wide range of industrial goods, and at times
                            a limited amount of consumer-type goods. We are, in this sense, already
                            doing part of what you suggest.<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">For text of

                        <p>Present legislation, however, does not permit the United States
                            Government to use aid funds solely to meet or out-bid the Soviet bloc in
                            a commercial trade offensive by matching or bettering bloc trade offers.
                            There are obvious dangers to engaging in such a policy, both from an aid
                            point of view as well as for commercial policy reasons. It would permit
                            the bloc to blackmail the United States into increased aid and probably
                            involve the United States in programs for which there would be little or
                            no sound economic rationale. Some less developed countries might seek to
                            increase United States aid offers by threatening to accept bloc offers.
                            Additionally, to permit the commercial sale of United States goods at a
                            fraction of their domestic price would subject the United States to
                            accusation of dumping, or subsidizing exports—practices which we deplore
                            when done by others.</p>
                        <p>In view of the complexities of this subject, I would suggest, providing

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Appropriation Request</hi>. The President reduced his
                            budget projection for the aid program from $4.945 billion as set forth
                            in the January budget to $4.525 billion. The reduction reflects the
                            recommendations of the Clay Committee and <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                                >Bell</persName>'s own recommendations after sitting with the Clay
                            Committee and reviewing the country programs, as well as the President's
                            estimate of the likely progress of legislation in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>When asked by the Committee what his views were on the amount of funds
                            that should be appropriated, General Clay refused to comment <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0385"/>in open session. He will be recalled to
                            closed session, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName>
                            thought that the General would say $4 billion or thereabouts, or
                            possibly might say a range of $4 billion to $4.2 or $4.3. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> thinks we can assume that the
                            House Foreign Affairs Committee will report out a bill authorizing about
                            what the General recommends and that for the remainder of this session
                            of Congress we will be trying to get an appropriation of about that
                            level.</p>
                        <p>The Clay Committee's recommendations are essentially to the effect that
                            the foreign aid program should be continued on somewhat sharper lines,
                            that the interests of the US in various countries should be kept more in
                            mind, and that somewhat stronger emphasis be placed on self-help
                            measures. With these objectives, the President, the Secretary, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> have expressed
                            agreement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> is not aware
                            of any substantial differences between the Administration and the Clay
                            Committee although the language of the report may give this impression.
                            In many cases, the report is worded more negatively than conversations
                            of the Committee indicated, especially with respect to India, Indonesia,
                            Africa, and Latin America. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> finds no
                            basic difficulty with the essential thrust of the Clay proposals. The
                            Committee was unhappy over the existence of some of the commitments,
                            such as a costly road in Burma, but it recognized that we must fulfill
                            commitments. The Committee would like to see military aid reduced
                            somewhat more rapidly than Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1"
                                >McNamara</persName> thinks it can be. This, however, is a
                            difference in timing rather than a difference of attitude.</p>

                        <p>There are about 30 countries in which there are good prospects for
                            achieving self-sustaining growth. A half dozen of those have reached the
                            point of not needing economic assistance of soft terms. Others—India,
                            Pakistan, Colombia, and Nigeria—have not yet achieved that status but
                            are moving in that direction and are making substantial progress. There
                            are another 12 or 15 countries (Chile and Brazil are examples) which
                            have the potential for moving forward but there is a question whether
                            governmental leadership is strong enough and clearly enough committed to
                            economic programs to anticipate very rapid forward movement. In <pb
                                n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0386"/>those cases the programs that
                            go to Congress are essentially on a contingent basis. If these countries
                            move forward, we would be prepared to help; if they do not, we would
                            leave such funds uncommitted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said that we do not
                            expect to argue that there is a particular figure for the aid
                            appropriation below which our national interests would be threatened. In
                            Latin America, for example, we are asking for lending authority of $600
                            million. We will state to the Committee that we are not at all sure we
                            will make loans up to that amount. If the Latin Americans conduct
                            themselves as we would like to see them, there will be very effective
                            uses for the $600 million and that is why we would like to have the
                            authority. We are talking about the power to make loans, not about a
                            specific program of accomplishment on which United States security would
                            stand or fall. That is why Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                                >Bell</persName> hopes that General Clay will express the need for a
                            range of figures within which we can work.</p>
                        <p>There is another group of countries which are essentially dominated by
                            short-run external or internal security problems. Korea, Viet Nam, Laos,
                            and Jordan fall into this classification. <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> does not claim that these countries are in a position
                            to make steady progress toward economic growth but it hopes they will
                            move into that position in not too long a period. This is not
                            impossible, as we can see in the case of Greece and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is a third group of countries in which US participation is
                            limited and secondary. Many African countries fall into this class, and
                            a number of Asian countries. We are not in the process of establishing
                            permanent economic programs in these countries. By and large, our aid
                            simply augments that of other major donor countries and in most cases is
                            confined to technical assistance. Sometimes we merely want to establish
                            a US presence. Sometimes our efforts may forestall Bloc enterprises. In
                            other cases, we may be able to acquire strategic facilities.</p>
                        <p>In our legislative presentation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1"
                                >Bell</persName> said that stress was being given to self-help, the
                            use of private resources (business, unions, cooperatives, farm
                            organizations, etc.), and to increased participation by Western Europe
                            and Japan in aid programs to the less-developed countries.</p>

                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s</p>
                        <p>Most of the discussion at the meeting centered around the first item
                            posed in the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> paper—more effective
                            promotion of US private investment in the less-developed countries. It
                            was recalled that when this Committee discussed foreign aid two years
                                ago,<note n="5" xml:id="d164fn5">See <ref target="#d126">Document
                                    126</ref>.</note> three points had been made about the private
                            sector: a) this phase of the aid program should <pb n="361"
                                xml:id="pg_361" facs="0387"/>have high priority; b) targets for US
                            investment should be identified in country programs; and c) the need for
                            centralization of this function in the US Government. How much progress
                            had been made on these points?</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Importance of the Private Sector</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said there had been a good deal of
                            change in the last two years. There is a substantially increased sense
                            of the importance of using the private sector, although this may not be
                            applied evenly by everyone in the aid business—State, Commerce, <gloss

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Organizational Arrangements</hi>. Also, there is much

                                >AID</gloss>, these functions are decentralized to the four regional
                            offices on the theory that the Director for the aid program in a region
                            should also be responsible for the private sector operations in that
                            region. Moscoso has a deputy for private enterprise in Latin America.
                            Also, centralized thinking and policy in this field is provided through

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Private Enterprise Targets in Country Plans</hi>. As to
                            identifying targets for private enterprise in country programs,
                            essentially this relates to the attitudes of the various countries and
                            doesn't yield readily to American initiatives. Where the attitude is
                            skeptical of the good will of American investment, it doesn't change
                            over night, and we have to keep plugging away. <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                >AID</gloss> would like to see a tailored program for each country
                            and a series of approach actions set up with consideration of
                            priorities. It may be, for example, that we could have spent our time
                            and effort more fruitfully in some countries than in pressing so hard
                            for investment guarantee bilaterals.</p>
                        <p>The secret to promotion of the private sector is to get it linked to a
                            part of the country plan in which the government has a great interest;
                            unless this is done, the countries don't regard private investment as a
                            contribution to the plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> thought the point of
                            bringing the private sector into development planning was very
                            important, and said that he would check on this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Development Banks</hi>. One mechanism that gets around
                            some of the difficulties in programming for the private sector is the
                            Development Bank, and it was suggested that this be looked into
                            carefully. Use of Development Banks removes from our people the onus and
                            responsibility <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0388"/>for direct
                            judgment on particular investments. The difficulty is that Development
                            Banks have a tendency to move only on the cream of the investments and
                            are negative as far as small businesses or risk investments are
                            concerned. There is no realization that a sure-thing approach to lending
                            is not necessarily a good way to move into economic growth.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce Activities</hi>. Commerce's efforts to promote
                            closer working relations between American business communities in the
                            developing countries and the Governments were outlined. These include
                            establishment of investment promotion centers, production centers, and
                            other mechanisms. Commerce has been talking to businessmen and to COMAP
                            and is in hopes that a series of standing committees can be established
                            to work up recommendations on specific problems, such as the use of
                            local currencies, guarantees, aid to exports. The Commerce Department is
                            also in a position to give more technical assistance in helping these
                            countries devise ways to expand their exports.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Multilateral Guarantee</hi>. We now have proposed to

                            investments. A question was asked as whether it wouldn't be well to have
                            authority for a multilateral guarantee for foreign investments which
                            would show concern for private investors other than Americans. A
                            Treasury official present at the meeting thought the waters might be
                            muddied if this were put forward now as a legislative proposal and that
                            it would be better to try to make progress on movements that are already

                            coming out of the talks he had in India.<note n="8" xml:id="d164fn8"

                        <p>The whole basis of our aid program is government-to-government, but when
                            that gets the economy moving, the private sector should come alive. We
                            should encourage and help the private sector to expand rapidly <pb
                                n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0389"/>as only when a country has its
                            own private sector does it feel able to have private investment from
                            abroad.</p>
                        <p>India is now trying to increase the investment rate and this means
                            radical expansion of capacity. In some sectors—steel and chemical
                            fertilizers—the Indians have some organizational talent for such
                            expansion. In other fields they don't have the kind of know-how that it
                            takes for radical expansion of plant—the training of men and programming
                            ahead of materials, orders, etc. These fields are in the private sector,
                            and the Indians are looking for ways to organize technical assistance in
                            the whole process of expanding plant. This probably means bringing in
                            American management know-how on a contract basis. And this relates to
                            getting to know the country's ambitions or plans for expansion. As other
                            countries progress, we will run into this problem more and more.</p>
                        <p>Where there are stabilization programs in order to get inflation under
                            control through <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> procedures, we
                            sometimes produce a general deflation in the private sector. This
                            produces some very curious developments which we haven't thought
                            through. Before a sensible policy is devised, we must have a notion of
                            which private sectors need expansion and we must give more attention to
                            the problem of “marrying” stabilization and development programs.</p>
                        <p>The most fundamental thing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1"
                                >Rostow</persName> said, is to get movement in the private sector.
                            The second most fundamental thing is to improve the climate for private

                            there was an understanding that Latin American countries would go to the

                            General agreement was achieved that terms of aid should be adapted more
                            to the balance-of-payments prospects of the countries being assisted,
                            that donors should make their aid available on somewhat more comparable
                            terms, and that the harder lenders should soften their loan terms. While
                            we cannot look for very rapid changes growing out of this, the US will
                            use the agreement as leverage in consortium meetings in the future to
                            try to get the European countries to soften their aid terms.</p>
                        <p>A real problem about terms of aid will center about the question of
                            supplier credits. The European countries and the US are all becoming
                            more sophisticated and enthusiastic about trying to guarantee or finance
                            their exports. The French are an example. Their foreign aid is very
                            soft—much of it in grants. But then they press ahead on terms like the
                            loan just completed with Mexico, which is really a supplier credit.
                            Mexico is in good shape and can stand it, but lots of other countries
                            can't. If they sign up for more than they can handle, we may be called
                            upon to bail them out.</p>
                        <p>As to the quantities of aid from other countries, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> said we don't have so much of a
                            case, especially with the French and not much with the British. We do
                            argue with the Germans that their contribution should be more. Canada
                            and Italy are the worst offenders, and we may get them to do a little
                            more, but not much.</p>

                            have high priority. It was left that probably the first ten minutes of

                        <p>Specifically, the resolution recommended to the members of the
                            Development Assistance Committee the following:</p>
                        <p>That they relate the terms of aid on a case-by-case basis to the
                            circumstances of each underdeveloped country or group of countries.</p>
                        <p>Where aid is on a project basis and where the terms appropriate to the
                            project differ from the terms appropriate to the country, that they
                            should consider whether they can apply one of the following methods: to
                            provide an appropriate “mix” of hard loans and soft loans or grants; to
                            lend under a “two-step procedure” providing for soft loans to
                            governments and lending on hard terms to projects; to lend projects on
                            hard terms and provide separate financial aid for balance-of-payments
                            relief.</p>
                        <p>That they make it their objective in principle to secure a significant
                            degree of comparability in the terms and conditions of their aid, and so
                            far as possible to eliminate or reduce discrepancies between them. While
                            this would not necessarily entail standard terms and conditions from all
                            donors, it would involve a liberalization of the terms adopted by some
                            members, whether in their individual aid programs or in concerted aid
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>For the purpose of implementing the above recommendations, the <gloss

                            present customary 25 years and described several possibilities which the

                            burden of interest charges, where such relief is needed. The Germans,

                        <p>Prior to the meeting, the US had opposed introduction of new tied aid
                            proposals at this meeting for two reasons. We felt there was a danger
                            that the important and carefully worked out agreement on terms of aid
                            which seemed virtually assured might be upset by introduction of new and
                            separate issues on the subject of tied aid which the working party had
                            not had adequate time to discuss thoroughly. We also felt that proposals
                            on tied aid should have the same kind of careful analysis and
                            consideration by the working party as did the terms of aid proposals. We
                            agreed, however, to a preliminary discussion of the tied aid

                        <p>This memorandum seeks Presidential guidance on further handling of the
                            Clay committee report in relation to the successful presentation to
                            Congress of the President's <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 aid
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Thus far, following the President's lead, I have minimized our
                            differences with the Clay report and stressed the area of agreement
                            between the Administration and the Clay committee. I have indicated
                            agreement on the “main points” or general thrust of the report and have
                            pointed out that the reduction of the President's request from $4.9
                            billion to $4.5 billion was in large part a response to the Clay
                            committee's recommendations. General Clay has expressed publicly the
                            gratification of his committee for the President's action in reducing
                            the budget request and implementing the committee's suggestions. Members
                            of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and press comment across the
                            country have expressed pleasure with the Administration's response to
                            the report and the apparent general agreement between the Administration
                            and the report on the future nature of U.S. aid.</p>
                        <p>We do, of course, have certain differences with the report and will face
                            still other problems arising from it. They are principally the
                            following:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>There are differences on specific areas and countries, some of
                                which are primarily matters of wording in the Clay committee report,
                                with no practical adverse implications (e.g., comments on Africa),
                                and some of which are real and worth disagreeing on. I believe the
                                number of differences in this latter category are few, such as
                                cutting our dollar aid to Nepal, military and economic aid to Iran,
                                and military assistance to Burma.</item>

                            <item>While we are not clear on the precise application of the report's
                                statement that U.S. aid should not go to state-owned enterprises
                                which <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0397"/>compete with private
                                endeavors, we have stated our general agreement on this point. The
                                Indian steel mill is the main object of the Committee's
                                recommendation, and this issue will have to be faced soon; thus far,
                                we are replying to questions by saying that the survey report has
                                just come in and is being studied.</item>

                            <item>We would oppose any attempt to make the signing of an investment
                                guarantee agreement a legislative requirement for U.S. aid to any
                                country. This problem has been raised by the Clay report, but the
                                committee is on our side of this argument.</item>

                            <item>We would wish to oppose any strict limitation on, or prohibition
                                of, voluntary U.S. contributions to United Nations aid
                                organizations. The Clay report's comment on this subject can be
                                accepted as a general guideline, and we will get some support from
                                the committee for our position.</item>

                                    indicate next week a figure of at least $4.0 to $4.1 billion as
                                    the minimum need for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964
                                    appropriations, we attempt thereafter to focus Congressional and
                                    public consideration on the range between his figure and the
                                    $4.5 billion requested. The difference in figures should be
                                    explained on the grounds that the $4.5 billion figure is our
                                    interpretation of what is needed for U.S. and free world
                                    security, that we should have funds on hand for increased
                                    lending if Latin American nations perform properly and for
                                    demonstrating the continuation of serious U.S. commitment to the
                                    Alliance, that we can and should be trusted with the Contingency
                                    Fund requested, and that there may be a few countries where we
                                    propose to do more than the Clay committee might think minimally
                                    necessary. We should argue that any cut in the budget request
                                    would entail corresponding costs in the total contribution of
                                    the program to free world security.</item>

                                <item>that we seek ultimate authorization figures of approximately
                                    $4.3 billion from the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign
                                    Relations Committees—roughly mid-way between the
                                    Administration's and General Clay's figure and possibly at the
                                    high end of his figures if he cites <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372"
                                        facs="0398"/>a range of $4.1-$4.3 billion—which allows both
                                    Committees to make some cuts. While the course of action beyond
                                    that point is now unclear, our intention should be to seek
                                    Congressional approval of an appropriation at Clay's bottom
                                    figure of $4.0 or $4.1 billion.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If the President agrees with this course of action, I suggest he convey
                            it to the leadership of the House and Senate, perhaps at its April 23
                            meeting, and to Chairman Morgan and possibly Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> at the same time, either
                            personally or through Mr. O'Brien. This personal assurance to the
                            chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations
                            Committees is considered necessary to assure them of the President's
                            strong backing of a $4.3 billion figure from their respective
                            committees. It may well be that the Senate figure will have to be
                            slightly higher than that of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to
                            reach an authorizing figure at this level. Also, there are strong
                            indications that these committees will require assurances that the
                            Administration will fight for a figure no lower than $4.0-$4.1 billion
                            at the appropriations stage. They regard themselves, rightly or wrongly,
                            as having been somewhat let down by the Administration in the final
                            stages of the appropriations process last year and the year before.</p>
                        <p>Whether this strategy will obtain the optimum appropriation remains to be
                            seen. No one has proposed a real alternative, though some believe it
                            will result in larger cuts than necessary. They point out that liberal
                            legislators and humanitarian groups are disturbed with the Clay report
                            and want the Administration to fight it. I agree that non-Administration
                            officials and private organizations should not be discouraged from
                            opposing the report if they so desire, since it is useful to have their
                            criticism to balance the comments of others of opposite persuasion.
                            While I agree also that the course of action proposed here would at
                            least temporarily inhibit their support for the program, I believe our
                            relations with these persons and groups will not suffer in the long
                            run.</p>
                        <p>Finally and concerning General Clay's testimony in executive session on
                            April 25 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he has indicated
                            quite clearly that he will abide by his promise to the President of
                            supporting a figure of $4.0 to $4.1 billion. I had planned to speak with
                            him once more before his testimony to urge him to support a range from
                            his rock bottom figure ($4.0-$4.1 billion) to a higher one ($4.2 or $4.3
                            billion) which would allow more funds to be on hand for additional
                            Alliance for Progress lending if Latin American nations perform
                            properly, and for the Contingency Fund.</p>
                        <p>Some argue, however, that the House committee will view Clay as “an
                            Administration witness” and cut under any figure he cites, and therefore
                            Clay should specify no figure and simply state his belief in an
                            appropriation “something under $4.5 billion.” While the Committee
                            extracted a promise from Clay at his last appearance to name a figure
                            this <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0399"/>time, an attempt could be
                            made to have him avoid a definite figure if the President thought this
                            desirable. The risk obviously is that if this were done, the House
                            Committee might cut more rather than less from the President's request
                            than if Clay named a figure.</p>
                        <p>If the President believes that Clay's citing a specific figure now is
                            desirable, or unavoidable in the light of his promise to the House
                            committee, I recommend that I talk with him as planned, and that the
                            President not meet with him until after his April 25 testimony. I think
                            General Clay might feel that he was being pressed rather closely if the
                            President reviewed the subject with him before his testimony.</p>
                        <p>We would appreciate the President's guidance on the matters reviewed in
                            this memorandum.</p>

                        <p>As directed in <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 159, I am forwarding
                            a second report on the coordination of economic and military aid
                                programs.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">Apparently the first report,
                                dated May 25, 1962 (<ref target="#d140">Document 140</ref>),

                        <p>The first step in improving coordination has been to establish a
                            programming framework and procedure that will facilitate the making of
                            overall judgments about our military and economic aid programs.
                            Substantial progress has been made in this direction; however,
                            coordination <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0400"/>is not just the
                            initiation of improved techniques, although these are important. More
                            basically, it is a different way of thinking—a fuller recognition that
                            various elements of the total U.S. foreign assistance program are
                            inter-related means to common long-run ends and that there can be a
                            fungibility of resources to achieve these ends.</p>
                        <p>The so-called “mix studies”, discussed more fully below, contributed at
                            least as much toward fuller understanding of this inter-relatedness as
                            toward more specific results.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">I. General Improvements in the
                                Planning Process</hi></p>
                        <p>The greatest improvements in coordination of the economic and military
                            assistance programs should come from the new format that has been
                            established for progressively integrating the planning of military and
                            economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>The A.I.D. program guidance issued to the field missions last summer
                            emphasized three key aspects of over-all planning: the importance of
                            developing an explicit assistance “strategy” which defines realistic
                            goals and relates proposed actions to these goals; the need to plan for
                            several years ahead; and the importance of basing the assistance
                            strategy on a comprehensive analysis of all aspects of a country's
                            situation—social, political and military as well as economic.</p>
                        <p>The military assistance guidance provides for continued <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> planning on a five-year basis,
                            identifies more expressly situations where the primary purposes of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> are in political areas rather
                            than military security, and singles out certain economic considerations
                            to be incorporated in development of military plans. The Country Team
                            submissions of both economic and military programs take the State
                            Department Country Guidelines as the statement of basic U.S.
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>The revised program guidance has already had a considerable effect. The
                            Country Assistance Programs submitted to A.I.D. by the field missions
                            have, among other things, provided the basis for developing in
                            Washington concise Country Assistance Strategy Statements. I believe
                            that these provide a sharper focus than we had before in relating means
                            to objectives, including both security and developmental objectives.</p>
                        <p>Further improvements in planning economic aid are expected both through
                            refinements of subsequent annual Country Assistance Program submissions
                            and through the use of a more penetrating analytical programming
                            document, the Long-Range Assistance Strategy (<gloss target="#t_LAS1"
                                >LAS</gloss>) for selected key countries. It is expected that these
                            more comprehensive studies will be carried out, with Washington
                            assistance, in Turkey, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Free China this
                            year, as well as in some other countries where the “mix” question is
                            less important.</p>
                        <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0401"/>
                        <p>The broader, longer term emphasis of A.I.D. programming provides a better
                            framework for considering military and economic programs together.
                            Longer-term A.I.D. planning will facilitate the meshing of economic
                            assistance programs with the Five-Year <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss> Plans. More specifically, the total resources approach
                            facilitates consideration of consumable maintenance requirements of
                            commercial-type items, commonly financed under <gloss target="#t_MAP1"
                                >MAP</gloss>, as a part of total requirements of the economy;
                            examination of the budget as a totality will be encouraged rather than
                            consideration of the military budget as an independent item. Also, the
                            development of overall aid strategies provides a clearer basis for
                            assessing the inter-relationships among different kinds of aid.</p>
                        <p>Not only the approach but also the timing of A.I.D. programming is being
                            revised to facilitate joint consideration of economic and military
                            assistance programs. The annual updating of the Five-Year Plans has
                            normally been accomplished in the spring while the annual A.I.D.
                            submission has been prepared in late summer or fall. This year I am
                            instructing the A.I.D. Missions, and the Country Teams in major “mix”
                            countries to prepare the general portion of the annual A.I.D. submission
                            for transmittal in June. Next year, we hope to further consolidate the
                            economic and military programming process. This will permit consistency
                            in emphasis and establishment of priorities among assistance activities
                            appropriate to each country situation.</p>
                        <p>More specific steps to improve the coordination of military and economic
                            and assistance are still needed. Several of the “mix” studies have not
                            yet been completed. Some of these can be combined with the <gloss

                                    toward an ultimate 25% reduction in Korean forces has been
                                    recommended and has been endorsed by the Ambassador and by the
                                    Department of State. The recommended plan is to reduce forces by
                                    about 35,000 a year for two years, and to consider similar force
                                    reductions for two more years at a later date in light of
                                    ensuing developments. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have so far
                                    adhered to their position opposing such reductions. Various

                                    views of the Department of Defense. Meanwhile, political
                                    developments in Korea have made it inopportune to propose this

                                <p>The Korean force reductions would not of themselves free
                                    significant Korean resources for economic development, but they
                                    would be a step toward putting a ceiling on Korean defense
                                    expenditures and perhaps open the door to further action in this
                                    direction. In addition, we propose to reinstate the program of

                                and Turkey have been long in reaching a conclusion. They have
                                demonstrated the highly complex problem of evaluating needs for U.S.
                                bilateral aid to countries which are receiving economic support
                                through <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> consortia and in which
                                the requirement for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and local
                                defense budg-ets depend in part on <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> force goals. Practical results have been steps to
                                transfer to the Turkish economy the production of certain items
                                heretofore supplied by the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and
                                to reduce support for the military budg-et in Greece. The intensive
                                work within the Executive Branch on these studies has, I believe,
                                resulted in a heightened consciousness of the inter-relationship of
                                military and economic programs. This factor, coupled with the
                                limited availability of military assistance funds, has in effect
                                produced a fairly good balance in our efforts.</item>

                        <p>Mix problems can be pursued further through two alternative approaches. A
                            high-level inter-departmental working group could be established to
                            review our politico-military strategy on a worldwide basis in light of
                            anticipated developments in the political and weapons fields. The group
                            would need to be at a high level because it would inevitably have to
                            consider the specifics of defense arrangements and war plans,
                            intelligence evaluations, and the most sensitive politico-military
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>The alternative approach would be intensified consultation between the
                            Department of State and the Secretary of Defense, relying on the latter
                            to provide his judgment as to worldwide defense requirements in relation
                            to U.S. defense plans.</p>
                        <p>The latter course seems to me to be preferable, and I am proposing a
                            series of discussions between the Secretary of Defense, the Under
                            Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and myself to review these
                            matters insofar as they affect <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and
                            economic assistance programs. We will then determine the need for
                            further staff studies.</p>

                                fragile since it is not based on a solidly-shared appreciation of
                                the basic policy considerations. Thus we do not have any agreed-on

                        <p>The outstanding characteristic of the Greek and Turkish studies is that
                            they have not adequately addressed the basic policy conflicts which

                            suggests that “a heightened consciousness of the interrelationship of

                            for the wrong reasons or just because we have pressed hard in the

                                will these be subjected to constant challenge as they were in the

                            to our allies.<note n="1" xml:id="d171fn1"><ref target="#d170">Document

                                >NSAM</gloss> 242 of May 9 and it was circulated to our officers
                            concerned, who have well in mind the President's interest in U.S.
                            military sales programs to allies such as Australia.</p>
                        <p>Even apart from the President's memorandum, we have of course strongly
                            supported military sales programs which are not inconsistent with other
                            foreign policy considerations. In this connection, I have in mind such
                            questions as the degree to which military sales to any specific country
                            could divert resources from higher priority economic development
                            objectives, particularly where we are extending economic aid to that
                            country, and the degree to which the arms which a country proposes to
                            purchase are compatible with the objective of focusing its military
                            resources on its internal defense as opposed to “arming against its
                            neighbors”.</p>
                        <p>I had not interpreted the President's memorandum as an injunction to
                            disregard all such foreign policy considerations in pursuing these sales
                            and I presume that it was not your intent that we should do so. Thus, in
                            instances in which military sales would be made either for cash or on
                            credit from sources such as the Export-Import Bank, I would expect that
                            we would be given the opportunity to provide political guidance in
                            relating these sales to other foreign policy objectives, while also
                            taking into account <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 242.</p>
                        <p>In other cases, where there is a potential competition for <gloss
                                target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds between military sales and grant
                            military assistance, I would hope that our two Departments could
                            collaborate fully, taking into account my responsibilities under Section
                            622(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. As you know, I have

                            seems called for. I would thus expect that Dave Bell would have the
                            primary role in the coordinated consideration of the issues involved in

                                comparability in the terms and conditions of their aid, and so far
                                as possible to eliminate or reduce disparities among them. It was
                                clear that in practice, though this would not necessarily entail
                                standard terms and conditions from all donors, it would involve a
                                liberalization of the terms adopted by some members, whether in

                        <p>The net flow of official financial resources from <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> countries in 1962 was maintained at but did not exceed
                            the level of $6 billion which had been reached in 1961 as the result of
                            an increase of over 20% compared with 1960. Official statements during
                            the aid review suggested that the total this year is likely to be larger
                            than in 1962.</p>
                        <p>The countries which were most forthcoming to the US plea for a greater
                            effort were the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Japan which
                            indicated that the 1963 flow will be substantially higher than 1962. The
                            Canadians also indicated greatly increased disbursements in 1963,
                            estimated at $125 million, although there has been no basic policy
                            review yet. The most pessimistic response came from the Italians who
                            thought little expansion could be expected from them in view of the
                            serious deterioration in their balance-of-payments situation the first
                            half of 1963. Most delegates suggested that figures for any one year may
                            be seriously affected by unusual special circumstances and that trends
                            can be measured only in terms of longer than the annual period.</p>
                        <p>In a discussion of the pipeline problem, the French called attention to
                            slow drawdowns and lack of projects and suggested focussing attention on
                            assistance in project preparation and planning. The <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> observer made an effective statement
                            on the Bank's experience with pipelines. He suggested that these are
                            incident to an expanding aid program and imply no reason to diminish
                            aid, and emphasized the Bank's technical assistance efforts in this
                            connection.</p>

                        <p>Terms of aid were discussed in the light of the April resolution which
                            had recommended, in light of the increasing problem of the debt service
                            burden of the less-developed countries, that <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> members moved toward liberalization of their aid terms
                            and seek a greater degree of comparability of such terms. (See page 14,
                            April 16 issue.)<note n="6" xml:id="d172fn6"><ref target="#d165"
                                    >Document 165</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> vigorously restated
                            the US position. While noting that the US is hardening its terms
                            wherever appropriate, such as Greece and Taiwan, he emphasized our
                            continuing concern about the debt service problem and the need for
                            better comparability of terms.</p>
                        <p>The British effectively presented their recent liberalization action. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has in some cases (notably for
                            Pakistan and India) waived interest payments on new commitments over a
                            seven-year period, cutting effective interest rates nearly in half. The
                            French indicated progress this last year in extending Government loans
                            to non-franc areas for the first time, in combination with exporter
                            credits. Others pointed out improvements, described their limitations,
                            and left the impression that considerable improvement had been made and
                            that there was continued but slower progress toward the goals. The
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> again made an effective
                            presentation both on the debt service capacity problem and on the
                            proposal now before the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> Board to
                            lengthen maximum loan terms and thereby take up previously excluded
                            projects.</p>
                        <p>Several delegations pointed to possible abuses in the use of exporter
                            credits. The French delegate, supported by others, stressed the
                            responsibility of governments for such credits in view of the guaranties
                            they typically offer, and thus broke ground for major work by the <gloss

                        <p>The meeting had before it a draft resolution on tied aid which contained
                            substantive proposals unacceptable to the US. We felt that the limited
                            progress thus far in the working party<note n="7" xml:id="d172fn7"

                                >OECD</gloss>.</note> reflected the current attitudes of the major
                            countries and that it would be inadvisable to reach agreement on any
                            tied aid resolution containing proposals which the US and other major
                            members avowedly are unprepared to implement in the foreseeable
                            future.</p>
                        <p>A pre-meeting canvass by our delegation revealed little enthusiasm for
                            the draft resolution but reluctance to take the lead in opposing it. We
                            indicated that if others wished to go forward with a resolution we would
                                <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0413"/>concur in it only on
                            condition it was clearly understood that the resolution was not binding
                            on the US in any way in view of our balance-of-payments problems. Bonn
                            had reacted negatively to the draft resolution which appeared pointed
                            principally at the Federal Republic. Thus, in a pre-<gloss
                                target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> meeting, the Six apparently agreed that
                            the resolution should not be adopted. At the <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> meeting, the Japanese stated at the outset their
                            inability to accept the full resolution and suggested elimination of
                            some of the specific recommendations aimed at reducing the scope of
                            tying. Citing the inability of the US to untie, the Germans then
                            suggested postponing the resolution, and were joined by Italy, Japan,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> countered the impact
                            of remarks tending to put the onus of rejection of the resolution on the
                            US by frankly stating that the US believed in the desirability of untied
                            aid, had furnished untied aid in the past, is tying only in the light of
                            its well-known balance-of-payments constraint, and is effectively
                            limiting the adverse effects of tying in the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s.</p>
                        <p>At the suggestion of the Dutch, the resolution was recommitted to the
                            working party for future consideration in light of results of studies
                            the working party is to make of measures aimed at reducing the scope and
                            harmful effect of tied aid.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Coordination</hi></p>
                        <p>Chairman Thorp raised a number of problems on aid coordination. The
                            French delegate thought that, by and large, coordination needs are being
                            met on a pragmatic basis by consortia, consultative groups, and the
                            Paris Club. He ended by suggesting that there be further consideration
                            of: a) countries with no looming problems, and b) countries with looming
                            difficulties. As examples of what he meant, he referred to the Far East
                            regional meeting and the meeting on Latin America at which Assistant
                            Secretary <persName>Martin</persName> made a presentation. The French
                            suggested, in the category of countries with no looming problems, that
                                <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> might discuss tropical Africa
                            next winter. The British suggested a review of experience with past

                            organizations.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> emphasized that
                            although the US has departed from a strict matching formula in
                            consortia, a rising US share of consortia contributions could not be
                            justified and a declining share would often be appropriate. He also
                            endorsed the idea of a review of past and current coordination
                            activities. The Germans, Japanese and Belgians supported a more regular
                            schedule of regional reviews. The consensus was in favor of such
                            meetings, with the Belgians emphasizing “systematic reviews”, and the
                            Chairman stressing the necessity of preparatory work to ensure <pb
                                n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0414"/>substantive comment. The
                            discussion indicated that reviews would be of value in identifying
                            country problems.</p>

                        <p>There was a general agreement with Chairman Thorp's statement on the
                            importance of technical cooperation in the development process and the
                            need for more attention to the essentiality of relating technical
                            cooperation more closely to capital assistance. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> called for increased attention to
                            potential technical cooperation with specific emphasis on assisting
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s to improve their development
                            planning and assess long-run manpower needs. Statements of several
                            delegates reflected concurrence on the importance of coordination at the
                            field level, and the significance of the role of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resident.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting of the technical cooperation working group earlier in the
                            month, the US had announced a decision to cease the Third Country
                            Training program. It was generally acknowledged that this was
                            appropriate and that the bilateral programs of other <gloss
                                target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> members could absorb the trainees.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Role of Private Capital</hi></p>
                        <p>Discussion produced general endorsement of statements in the Chairman's
                            report as to the important role of private capital in the development of
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s and concern about the decline
                            of direct and indirect private investment. Our delegation mentioned the
                            International Bank's work on an arbitration convention and the Bank
                            observer gave some details. The <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss> also
                            gave an effective statement of its activities along this line and
                            prospects and discussed parallel financing with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and others.</p>
                        <p>The Germans reported that a draft law is now before the Federal Republic
                            Parliament designed to encourage private flows. The Dutch urged
                            increased pressure in <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> to push
                            through a convention on protection of private property. They noted that
                            the findings of the report on a multilateral investment guarantee
                            produced no unsurmountable technical or legal difficulties and suggested
                            that the November meeting might be an appropriate time to get a positive
                            reaction thereon. The <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> proposed the
                            IFC as a possible solution to the institutional arrangement. The French
                            endorsed continuation of study of investment guarantees but made clear
                            that the time of decision would find France reluctant, as it is fearful
                            this might involve payment of compensation on old investments in former
                            colonies. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> expressed
                            general concurrence in the desirability of a continuing study of a
                            multilateral investment guarantee as one measure of stimulating private
                            flow, but cited other possibilities. The observer from the <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> said the Bank would be pleased to
                            collaborate with the Secretariat on the study but confessed doubt as to
                            the extent to which discussion of the institutional arrangements could
                            go. The <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0415"/>Chairman summed up the
                            discussion by accepting the instruction to continue to search for ways
                            of encouraging private flows.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Effectiveness of Aid</hi></p>
                        <p>There was a general consensus that in considering effectiveness of aid
                            more attention would be needed to standards of evaluation, and it was
                            agreed that more should be done by <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>
                            on this topic. The German representative suggested a two-pronged
                            approach to evaluation: a) exchange of donor impressions in consortia,
                            and b) establishment of a working group to study ways of setting
                            standards for measuring effectiveness. The Chairman indicated that
                            consideration would be given to the desirability of a working party on
                            evaluation, and cited also the resources of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"

                            billion by $850 million, but he was somewhat heartened that the bill
                            appeared to have bipartisan support for a $4.1 billion authorization.

                            however, the House of Representatives approved only $2.8 billion in
                            foreign assistance, or $1.7 billion below President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s earlier request, and the
                            Senate version called for about $3.3 billion. After Congress authorized
                            only $3.0 billion in new funding, President Johnson issued a statement
                            on December 14 urging Congress to increase the funding levels. For text

                        <p>On December 16, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                                Johnson</persName> signed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1963 (P.L.
                            88-205; 77 Stat. 379). He claimed in a signing statement that the $3
                            billion authorized in the legislation “reflects a dangerous reduction in
                            funds and a consequent dangerous reduction in our security.” He also
                            indicated that he had asked <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            Administrator <persName corresp="#p_BDE1">Bell</persName> “to put our
                            foreign operations on a sounder basis—to insist on maximum effort by aid
                            recipients—and to intensify our efforts to eliminate excess or
                            ineffective personnel. We will resist reorganization for
                            reorganization's sake—but we do intend to present to the Congress next
                            year a more effective, efficient aid program.” For text of the
                            statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                        <p>On the same day, President Johnson called for the creation of an
                            Executive branch committee under the chairmanship of Acting Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to examine the foreign
                            assistance program. Formally known as the President's Committee To
                            Examine the Foreign Assistance Program, this group was asked to develop
                            recommendations for the President by January 15, 1964. Documentation on

                        <p>The President will wish to review the program changes proposed in the

                            result of Congressional action this year,<note n="1" xml:id="d176fn1"
                                >See <ref target="#d175">Document 175</ref>.</note> since the way in
                            which these cuts are distributed may involve important foreign policy
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and the Department of
                            Defense should outline briefly the major changes proposed from the $4.5
                            billion <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964 presentation figure, with
                            a brief recapitulation of the reasons for each. Any forced reductions in
                            commitments or implied commitments should also be appropriately
                            mentioned. I suggest that individual mention need be made only of
                            changes over $10 million, e.g. a cut in a country program, lumping the
                            remainder together in appropriate categories. The Department of State
                            might submit any alternative recommendations with respect to these
                            program changes which it feels required from the foreign policy point of
                            view.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear George</hi>: I am writing this private letter
                            to amplify my thinking about State Department policy control of the
                            foreign aid program.</p>
                        <p>You know the history of this. The coordination resided in Doug Dillon
                            when he was Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and moved up with him
                            when he took your present job. Thereafter, <persName>Jack
                                Bell</persName> and his people handled the matter under you (the
                            so-called BFAC) and it was rather petering out by the fall of 1962 and
                            tending to move somewhat into Jeff Kitchen's hands. Then, when Dave Bell
                            took over from <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>, the
                            Executive Order specifically lodged the coordination authority in
                                him<note n="1" xml:id="d177fn1">Reference is to Executive Order
                                10973, November 3, 1961.</note> and it has been exercised by a group
                            under the leadership of <persName corresp="#p_CHB1">Hollis
                                Chenery</persName>, with Joe Wolf acting on the military side.</p>
                        <p>What I would say about this arrangement does not in any way reflect on
                            the tremendous competence and national-mindedness of Dave Bell. But the
                            plain fact is that there have been what seemed to be two substantial
                            difficulties: <list>
                                <label>a.</label>
                                <item>Putting the military under a whole group of economic-minded
                                    people has meant that we have not had nearly as strong a
                                    political input as used to be the case when the coordination was
                                    in the State Department itself. A specific example, now out of
                                    date, would be the continuing pressures on us to sanction
                                    transfers from the military account to economic aid. More
                                    recently, and still true, we have found it very difficult to get
                                    proper clearance of credit sales activities even after these had
                                    the policy approval of the relevant Assistant Secretaries in the
                                    State Department, with Dave's people taking the position that
                                    they had a veto right down to the last million dollars of where
                                    money should be applied. Moreover, despite what Dave says about
                                    any failure in State Department influence being due to the
                                    Assistant Secretaries not doing their job, the fact is that any
                                    system that forces them to work through <gloss target="#t_AID1"
                                        >AID</gloss> in order to reach our program inevitably tends
                                    to inhibit their influence and indeed their degree of knowledge
                                    and participation in the Military Assistance Program. I do not
                                    mean to suggest that one should lightly yield to the constant
                                    fears of an Ambassador or an Assistant Secretary, but there have
                                    been political <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0420"/>factors
                                    that might well have affected the size and composition of
                                    specific programs more than has in fact been the case. I think
                                    we in ISA fairly well represent the State Department's position,
                                    but this is really no substitute for hearing it strongly
                                    expressed from the Department itself. I would even go so far as
                                    to say that the budget requests in the last two years might have
                                    been slightly higher had the Department's voice been heard
                                    loudly, although I say this believing that Bob McNamara would
                                    probably not agree.</item>

                                <item>While I am not a full judge of what has gone on before the
                                    Committees on the Hill, my people who follow them closely
                                    confirm my impression that the economic program particularly has
                                    suffered through not having the hard-headed political interest
                                    and policy of the US constantly expressed. After Dean's opening
                                    blast, usually restricted by its being an open hearing, the
                                    matter devolves solely to the Assistant Secretaries and on
                                    occasion lower still. The kind of constant shepherding and
                                    personal intervention that I believe Doug Dillon used to provide
                                    in 1958-61 has simply not been present, and all the last-minute
                                    cannonades in the world cannot make up for that lack. Although
                                    Dave himself has always been thoroughly familiar with the
                                    Department's policy and positions, he is necessarily identified
                                    as predominantly economic in approach, and this has tended to
                                    obscure the often completely persuasive Realpolitik of
                                    particular programs.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Thus, both conceptually and because of the practical difficulties stated
                            above, I myself would be highly sympathetic to the creation of what
                            might be called an “Under Secretary for Programs” within the Department.
                            I prefer this title to Henry Owen's “Under Secretary for Economic
                            Affairs” because the responsibility of the position should extend deeply
                            into the military field and might well embrace a few other odds and ends
                            of a non-economic character as well (science?).</p>
                        <p>But the question is also one of personalities. When Dave got his present
                            coordination authority in 1962, Alex Johnson was swamped and <persName
                                corresp="#p_MGGC2">George McGhee</persName> would have been badly
                            miscast in the coordination role. Now that you have Averell carrying a
                            real share of the top load, I would myself think that Alex Johnson, with
                            a lot of support from Jeff Kitchen and his people, could do this job
                            admirably. It would, of course, mean that as a practical matter Dave
                            Bell would move to No. 5 instead of No. 4 in the Department's pecking
                            order, but this I would regard as virtually inevitable in the
                            circumstances. The point is that Alex has the necessary force and
                            knowledge to bring home the specific national interest of the country
                            and the vital effect on foreign policy of cuts to the important swing
                            Congressmen. I need hardly say that we would have utmost confidence in
                            him from the standpoint of wise and effective policy guidance on the
                            military assistance side, and this part would fit particularly naturally
                            into the hitherto somewhat uneasy charter that Jeff Kitchen has had.</p>

                        <p>This letter is obviously what we used to call in the War a “burn before
                            reading” note. It really is not for me to suggest ways of reorganizing
                            the Department, and I don't want to sound at all critical of Dave—who I
                            think would actually benefit from having his hands freed to run the
                            economic show alone and not have to worry his head constantly about the
                            miscellaneous coordination problems.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the discussion there seemed to be general agreement that
                            it would be desirable for Southard to prepare a US position paper for
                            consideration by various agencies which would provide authority for the
                            US to offer a standing line of credit to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> of about $2 billion to be matched by similar lines of
                            credit from 8 to 10 of the other principal financial countries in the
                            amount of about $4 billion. This credit could be drawn upon only when
                            the country providing it was in surplus to make advances to countries in
                            deficit. In return it could be demanded back from the Fund as the
                            country whose funds had been advanced became in its turn a deficit
                            country and needed to add to its resources. It was thought that while
                            legislation would be required it might be easier if the Federal Reserve
                            Board should be the source of funds. It was agreed that means should be
                            sought for the Fund to give in return for monies it had drawn a note
                            which could be counted as a reserve of the Central Bank.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> thought no such proposal
                            would succeed unless the US lobbied for it. The Europeans were
                            exceedingly lukewarm. The Germans had come out with a rather favorable
                            statement but immediately had been slapped at meeting of the Six for
                            doing so without consultation. The French looked upon it as merely a
                            device for strengthening sterling and <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397"
                                facs="0423"/>would be very reluctant to participate, he feared. Even
                            with our leadership, he was doubtful of success.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether such a move would be expected to be accompanied by any
                            significant change in criteria for <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>
                            advances. He thought not and that the Europeans would strongly oppose it
                            for the same reason that the less developeds would support it. The
                            Europeans fear the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> will go bankrupt
                            in backing up deficits of less developed countries. In this connection
                            he also answered this by saying that the general view was that present
                            Fund resources were adequate to take care of the needs of the less
                            developed countries and this move is essentially to support reserve
                            currencies, particularly sterling.</p>
                        <p>This does not preclude some modest changes in the willingness of <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> to make funds available automatically
                            but they would be very modest.</p>
                        <p>It will be necessary for the US to have a position of action by early
                            April.</p>

                        <p>I read to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Press Release and stated that it
                            specifically pointed out that no project for Cuba has been approved by
                            the Governing Council of the Special Fund. In this connection I
                            explained that the agreement which had been signed is what is known as a
                            basic agreement which sets forth the conditions which would apply should
                            the Governing Council approve projects for a given signatory country. It
                            did not refer to a specific project but was a prerequisite for
                            assistance through the Special Fund and the framework within which
                            projects subsequently approved by the Governing Council would
                            operate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> commented that it is to
                            be assumed that Cuba would not have signed the agreement unless it
                            intended to seek Special Fund assist-ance. I agreed that this was a
                            logical interpretation. However, the Special Fund receives many requests
                            and all are not recommended for approval, because certain ones do not
                            qualify or for other reasons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1"
                                >Smith</persName> asked if the U.S. could withhold its approval and
                            funds in the event the Special Fund submitted and recommended a Cuban
                            project for approval by the Governing Council. I replied that the U.S.
                            was only one of 18 members sitting on the Governing Council. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> stated that he assumed
                            that there was no veto provision in the Special Fund. I replied that
                            this was my understanding.</p>
                        <p>I then explained in some detail the processing procedures to which
                            requests for Special Fund assistance were subjected before they might be
                            finally recommended to the Governing Council. (This explanation was
                            similar to that given Mr. Socas—please see memorandum of conversation of
                            March 16.)<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">Not printed. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, 398.051/3-1661)</note> I explained that we had
                            no knowledge of the requests made of the Special Fund by Governments. We
                            would normally have knowledge only of those projects which the Managing
                            Director recommended to the Governing Council in advance of the meetings
                            of the Council which were generally held in May and December.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on the number of requests which the Special Fund has
                            received and the number of projects which had been approved, I quoted
                            from the “Programme recommended by the Managing Director” to the
                            December meeting of the Governing Council (Doc. SF/R.2 of November 4,
                            1960), which indicates that up to September 30, 1960, the Special Fund
                            had received 254 requests. The number of projects <pb n="399"
                                xml:id="pg_399" facs="0425"/>approved as of December 31, 1960
                            totaled 115, to which the Special Fund had made allocations of
                            $95,894,000.</p>
                        <p>In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName>'s question
                            on the Special Fund budget referred to in the news report, I replied by
                            explaining that the Special Fund is financed by voluntary contributions
                            as is the case with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Expanded
                            Program of Technical Assistance. I described the pledging procedure to
                            him and confirmed that the amount given in the press item was the same
                            amount ($46.9 million) so far voluntarily pledged by governments to the
                            Special Fund for the year 1961. I also described the U.S. 40% formula in
                            matching contributions up to $100,000,000 for the Special Fund and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Technical Assistance Program
                            combined.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SBK1">Smith</persName> seemed pleased to have
                            the information which had been given him and requested that I send to
                            him a copy of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Press Release only.
                            He felt that with the background given him and the Press Release he
                            would have sufficient information to explain the situation to the
                            Congressman.</p>

                        <p>(I received a message late Friday, March 17, from Mr. Willis of Treas-ury
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> would have a
                            meeting on Monday to consider new international financial arrangements.
                            On Monday morning I received a message from Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> that the meeting had been called
                            because of concern by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> that a working group set up by <gloss
                                target="#t_CEA1">CEA</gloss> under Mr. Triffin to prepare for <gloss
                                target="#t_EPC1">EPC</gloss> meeting might get involved in
                            international financial planning of the sort which was properly the
                            responsibility of the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> opened the meeting by
                            saying that he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> were concerned with two points. The first was
                            that in any international discussions, formal or informal, it was
                            imperative that the US representatives speak with a single voice derived
                            from coordinated positions. If there were to be any actual negotiations,
                            they would presumably be handled by representatives of State and
                            Treasury.</p>
                        <p>The second point was that, insofar as the United States took a
                            substantive position on international financial questions in the course
                            of the <gloss target="#t_EPC1">EPC</gloss> meeting, it was important
                            that these substantive positions be coordinated through the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>, which was the established mechanism
                            for this purpose. I inquired if it weren't possible that some of the
                            issues involved were similar to those on which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> was seeking guidance for use
                            in <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> discussions of expansion of its
                            resources. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> agreed that
                            this was the case. It was, therefore, important not only to have
                            instructions for <gloss target="#t_EPC1">EPC</gloss> meeting but also
                            for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> on this
                            particular subject.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWW1">Heller</persName> indicated that the
                            Triffin group, to which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName>
                            had made reference, would be meeting, starting Tuesday morning, March
                            22, <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0428"/>to deal with the question
                            of the coordination of internal financial policies of member
                            governments. Its mandate was confined to this subject.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that there were two other subjects on which policy guidance
                            was needed. One was the international financial mechanisms which were
                            needed to deal with problems with particular reference to the role of
                            the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> and to the possibility of the US
                            becoming a member of the <gloss target="#t_EMA1">EMA</gloss>. This was
                            clearly a <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> problem. It was left that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SFAJ1">Southard</persName> would be asked to
                            prepare a paper on <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> aspects and State
                            and Treas-ury on <gloss target="#t_EMA1">EMA</gloss> aspects.</p>
                        <p>It was also felt that there would need to be a consideration of how
                            better exchanges of views could be organized, particularly among a more
                            limited group of countries than <gloss target="#t_EPC1">EPC</gloss>
                            within <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> framework. It was felt that
                            this paper should be drawn on the assumption that the US would not be
                            able to join the <gloss target="#t_EMA1">EMA</gloss> as it now exists.
                            It was agreed that State and Treasury would collaborate on this paper. I
                            proposed that the first step might be to send some ideas to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TJW2">Tuthill</persName> for comment. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> agreed and asked that
                            Mr. Abrams or Mr. Renner<note n="1" xml:id="d181fn1"> Manuel Abrams,
                                Officer in Charge, Economic Organization Affairs, and John C.

                            respect to such a telegram as well as preparation of the paper.</p>
                        <p>It was generally felt that the first problem would be the most likely
                            subject for discussion in <gloss target="#t_EPC1">EPC</gloss> and the
                            other two might be more useful for informal conversation outside the
                            meetings. It was agreed, however, that no formal decision could be taken
                            on this point until the papers had all been seen.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the three papers have relationships with each other
                            and that it will be necessary to examine them together to ensure that
                            they are properly related.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that this informal group, representing the <gloss
                                target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> agencies at a higher level than the
                            staff committee, but not an <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> body,
                            would deal with paper #2 and with the coordination problem. It was
                            agreed on my suggestion that we should wait until after the coordination
                            had been achieved before deciding which parts of the package needed
                                <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> approval.</p>
                        <p>It was felt that the three papers should be ready for examination within
                            two weeks.</p>
                        <p>Neither Exim nor Commerce representatives played any part in the
                            discussion. The Federal Reserve representative spoke strongly in favor
                            of an active <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> role in the whole
                            matter. The conversations were entirely friendly, though Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> was firm on the need for clear US
                            positions, even for exploratory conversations.</p>
                        <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0429"/>
                        <p>(Immediately after the meeting I informed Mr. Renner of what had
                            transpired and asked him to get in touch with Mr. <persName

                        <p>As I explained in our conversation on Wednesday afternoon,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d182fn1">May 17.</note> we have recommended that the least
                            unsatisfactory course for the United States to follow is to work for
                            deferral of the project on technical economic grounds. If a majority of
                            the Governing Council cannot be secured for deferral, the fall back
                            position of the United States should be a quiet negative vote on the
                            grounds that our questions about the economic soundness of the project

                            likely foreign reaction to a U.S. effort to defeat the project. These

                            references made by both Senators Bridges and Capehart on the Cuban
                                project<note n="1" xml:id="d183fn1">Not further identified.</note> I
                            felt it was desirable to have a better understanding among some of our
                            friends in Washington on why this project was included in our programme
                            and <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0431"/>also of its relationship to

                            Aitken, on Representatives Walter Judd and John Rooney and also on Al

                        <p>I continue to believe that the United States missed a great opportunity
                            in not supporting this project actively because it is clearly designed
                            to help the Cuban people and not Dr. Castro, just as our projects in
                            Formosa are designed, not to help Chiang Kai-Shek but the people of the
                            Republic of China and those in Korea, not for the help of the military
                            junta presently running Korea, but the Korean people. However, that is
                            all water over the dam. I do believe in the future an opportunity will
                            be missed unless we do emphasize the distinction between projects
                            designed to help people and those designed to help governments, many of
                            which are archaic.</p>

                            viewpoints which you expressed in it and indeed which you and I have

                        <p>Although it does not show on the surface, the State Department policies
                            are rapidly moving in the direction that you would feel is right, <pb

                            much more apparent in the next six months. So many wrong habits are
                            deeply ingrained here, but I am encouraged to think that we are moving
                            ahead, perhaps with greater speed than we have a right to hope for.</p>
                        <p>If you are coming to Washington in the next few weeks, do let me know, as
                            I would like to see you and talk with you about several
                            questions—nothing immediate, but important for the longer haul. I expect
                            to be away in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia from the 25th of

                        <p>Although Congress has not yet passed the necessary legislation and the
                            new Agency for International Development remains to be established, we
                            have already, for all intents and purposes, embarked on the President's

                            through provides an opportunity for all concerned to contribute to the
                            transition to the new program.</p>
                        <p>I wish first of all to commend the staff for the many constructive
                            activities which have recently been taken to facilitate the transition.
                            We are offering to assist in the efforts soon to begin to evaluate the
                            responses to the outgoing cable No. <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>

                            on the aid approach to be taken in each country under the new
                                program.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">See <ref target="#d114fn2"
                                    >footnote 2, Document 114</ref>.</note> We are also identifying
                            and preparing an inventory of policy and procedure decisions that will
                            be required. We are cooperating in developing development lending
                            procedures which will prevail in the period prior to the time when there
                            is a final decision made by the new agency. We are also evaluating the
                            backlog of loan applications we now hold.</p>
                        <p>The actions which the <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> takes between
                            now and when <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is established can have
                            an important bearing on the shape of the new program. We can contribute
                            to the solution of the many important policy and procedural questions
                            that are involved in the transition to the new program. Conversely, we
                            can also conduct ourselves in such a way to avoid prejudicing future
                            policies and procedures. Finally, the development lending function
                            continues to form a most important part of the economic assistance
                            program of the U.S. Government—an importance which does not permit us to
                            stand still.</p>
                        <p>More specifically, <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> can contribute to
                            the transition in the following three ways: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The <gloss target="#t_DLF1">DLF</gloss> staff, which has
                                    developed an expertise in lending for economic development,
                                    should take the opportunity to distill from four years of
                                    lending experience considerations which should bear on the
                                    procedures and policies of the new Agency for International
                                    Development.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>In responding to inquiries and new applications, it can couch
                                    its replies so as to indicate the new context and the new
                                    considerations which will be brought to bear in evaluating
                                    specific loans.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>In evaluating proposals already on hand and in communicating
                                    with applicants, it can indicate the changed concepts and bases
                                    for evaluation that are now taking effect.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In making our contributions it will be necessary to bear in mind the
                            central features of the new <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program.
                            Perhaps the most important of the new concepts is that each activity,
                            whether of a loan or grant nature, will be undertaken as a part of a
                            total country approach or program. In following the approach or program
                            for each country, it will be necessary to relate each activity to a
                            priority goal, program or national development plan. In selecting
                            countries for assistance as well as activities to be <pb n="408"
                                xml:id="pg_408" facs="0434"/>supported, priority consideration will
                            be given to those making a reasonable self-help effort in terms of
                            mobilizing all available resources by means of sensible planning,
                            budgeting and other measures; undertaking measures to reduce dependence
                            on external resources; tapping the energies and spreading benefits of
                            development to the entire population; and exhibiting honesty in the
                            administration of public affairs. Moreover, we will be seeking ways to
                            use particular financing as leverage for obtaining improvement along the
                            following lines. In the case of loans, which will now be on a largely
                            dollar repayable basis, we will need to consider the capacity of each
                            economy to service debt rather than the character of each activity to be
                            financed.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of ways immediately available to us which can give us
                            a basis for proceeding consistent with the criteria of the new program.
                            The staff should keep in close touch with the materials developed in the
                            course of Congressional consideration of the foreign aid program and
                            specifically the funds programmed for the Fiscal Year 1962. Each staff
                            member should familiarize himself with the red-covered presentation to
                            Congress entitled “The Act for International Development—A Program for
                            the Decade of Development; Objectives, Concepts and Proposed
                                Program.”<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">Not found.</note> In addition,
                            as they become available, I suggest that the staff also obtain and read
                            this year's testimony on the International Development and Security Act
                            before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign
                            Affairs Committee, and in particular my statement on June 22, 1961
                            before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.<note n="4"

                        <p>Additionally, the staff should take into account existing country
                            commitments, which, of course, are tentative as to amount pending final
                            action by the Congress (e.g., India). We must also have the views of the
                            Department of State, <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, the Program
                            Development Task Force, and the field from the standpoint of the
                            criteria enumerated above.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above guidelines, I am confident that the ingenuity of
                            the staff, with which I have been impressed, will make it possible for
                            us to make the turnaround and effectuate a rapid integration of our

                        <p>Despite the elimination of any specific commitment of United States funds
                            from the proposal for a United Nations Development Authority, I continue
                            to have serious reservations about the desirability of a US initiative
                            along these lines. Before proceeding to crystallize our thinking on this
                            proposal, I believe we must have satisfactory answers to the following
                            questions:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Would the <gloss target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> actually represent
                                a significant addition to existing facilities in the field of
                                development planning? At present, in addition to our bilateral
                                arrangements and those of other countries, there are various
                                multilateral devices available, including the <gloss
                                    target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> Special Fund. Assistance in development planning can
                                also be provided by certain regional organizations and by private
                                foundations. Since there are obviously a limited number of personnel
                                who possess real talent in this field, I think we have no assurance
                                that a <gloss target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss>, even if created under
                                favorable conditions, would possess the means to offer substantial
                                assistance to the lesser-developed countries.</item>

                                lesser-developed members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?
                                There is also a strong possibility that the lesser-developed
                                countries would make a strong drive to amend—and succeed in the
                                effort—the proposal in order to create something in the nature of

                            <item>Is it not probable that a <gloss target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss>,
                                because of its broader function and the larger sums of money
                                involved, would be subjected to much stronger and less responsible
                                political influences than has been true of the <gloss

                                possibility that its operation would prove to be a political
                                liability to the US rather than an asset? We would face a <pb

                                bilaterally. For example, we might arouse considerable political
                                resentment in Country A if we should fail to offer to finance a
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss>-approved project in that
                                country at the same time that we are engaged in financing projects
                                in Countries B, C and D which have never received a <gloss

                                would be a “pig-in-the-poke” policy. On the other hand, the failure
                                of the donor countries to give priority to <gloss target="#t_UNDA1"
                                    >UNDA</gloss>-approved projects might backfire politically

                            <item>Would other major donor nations support the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> proposal, and would they be
                                willing actually to use it as a basis for a significant portion of
                                their economic assistance? I suspect that the fact that <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> has approved a particular project
                                would be meaningless in the case of France. Germany, of course, is
                                not a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I suspect the
                                United States would in the end be the only country channeling
                                significant amounts of aid into plans approved by <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss>.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The foregoing questions seem to me to cast considerable doubt on
                                the desirability of making the <gloss target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss>
                                proposal a major Presidential initiative. But in addition there is
                                an objection which I think may be even more important. In entrusting
                                the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program to a single agency
                                we have sought to achieve both coherent administration and the
                                effective utilization of foreign assistance in support of foreign
                                policy objectives. It can be argued that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> proposal itself represents the
                                fulfillment of a foreign policy objective since it might serve to
                                strengthen the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But at the same
                                time there is no assurance that the plans proposed by <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> would be consistent with the more
                                precise requirements of our foreign policy, and certainly the
                                existence of <gloss target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> would tend in the
                                direction of diffusing rather than concentrating the direction of
                                our foreign assist-ance effort. It seems to me quite necessary that
                                in the next few years we should think not merely in terms of the
                                development of individual countries but of such matters as the
                                effect of total development planning on world markets or even on the
                                commercial interests of areas for which we have special
                                responsibility. The proliferation of agencies to guide country
                                planning by the creation of new instrumentalities such as <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNDA1">UNDA</gloss> would seem to make these
                                objectives more difficult to achieve.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: I have been following
                            closely the plans which are being made for a multilateral borrowing
                            arrangement in the International Monetary Fund, because I attach very
                            great importance to this project. Reports which have reached me of the
                            discussions which the financial officials of the European Economic
                            Community had in Ostend on July 17 have been of great interest,<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d187fn1">This meeting has not been further
                                identified.</note> and I understand there will be further
                            discussions early in September. I am writing this letter to let you know
                            of my concern regarding certain aspects of the negotiations in the
                            Fund.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to learn that substantial agreement was reached at the Ostend
                            meeting that the resources of the Fund should be strengthened so as to
                            improve its capacity to deal with major pressures in the foreign
                            exchange field, and that the best way to do this is by means of some
                            sort of borrowing arrangement. I fully share these conclusions, which
                            should pave the way for active negotiation in the Executive Board of the
                            Fund following the Annual Meeting in Vienna. There are of course many
                            details to be worked out, including matters such as the duration of
                            loans, the rate of interest, repayment arrangements, the additional
                            drawing rights to be acquired by lending countries, and the very
                            important question of the amount which each country would agree to lend.
                            I am most hopeful that the agreed plan will be completed by the end of
                            the year so that legislative action can be taken early in 1962 in those
                            countries such as the United States, where it is necessary.</p>
                        <p>I understand that some officials who met at Ostend feel that the
                            participating country should retain full discretion to decide whether it
                            would loan to the Fund at a given time, and that no firm commitment
                            should be given to the Fund by the countries participating in the
                            borrowing arrangement.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0438"/>
                        <p>I feel strongly that our objective must be to create confidence that the
                            Fund is equipped to meet major demands at a time of emergency, as it was
                            able to do in the recent case of the United Kingdom. Frankly, I doubt
                            that an arrangement which would leave it quite uncertain whether in fact
                            participants would lend to the Fund would provide that much-needed
                            confidence. The Fund is not now equipped to meet large demands.
                            Following the drawings by the United Kingdom and India, the Fund's
                            holdings of the eight currencies used in those drawings amounted to only
                            $1.6 billion, plus $2.2 billion in U.S. currency and $2 billion in gold
                            (excluding gold invested in U.S. bills). Also by the end of this year
                            additional demands of at least $300 million probably will have to be met
                            by the Fund. Yet firm assurance that the Fund will have adequate
                            resources at its disposal is the best insurance that those resources
                            will not have to be used. If the speculators and others who are keeping
                            close watch of the balance of payments positions of the industrial
                            countries conclude that the Fund does not have the resources to meet
                            major demands, they will be much more likely to probe for weak
                            spots.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons I believe that any effective borrowing arrangement
                            should provide for firm commitments by each participating country to
                            lend to the Fund up to a stated amount of its own currency. At the same
                            time operating safeguards should be included in the arrangement to
                            protect participating countries against unreasonable demands for loans.
                            There should be criteria to determine the selection of the currencies to
                            be borrowed at a given time and their actual use thereafter, and there
                            should be full consultation with the lending member.</p>
                        <p>These questions probably cannot be worked out prior to the Annual
                            Meeting. However, I hope that you and your colleagues in the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will continue to consider them with an
                            open mind so that the Executive Directors after the Annual Meeting can
                            undertake a full and unhampered negotiation.</p>
                        <p>So far as concerns the Annual Meeting, I understand that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JP5">Jacobsson</persName>'s speech will probably include
                            a careful statement of the progress being made in working out the
                            borrowing arrangement. In my speech I intend to encourage the Executive
                            Directors to proceed promptly with negotiations, and I hope that you and
                            other Governors will find it possible to give similar encouragement.</p>
                        <p>Since we agree on the objective of a borrowing arrangement, even though
                            the details remain to be worked out, I believe it would be useful for
                            the Governors at Vienna to approve a brief resolution. You are familiar
                            with the draft prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JP5"
                                >Jacobsson</persName> which reads as follows: <quote

                        <p>Adoption of a resolution of this kind would have the great advantage of
                            indicating to the world in simple language that the Governors have

                            hearing your reactions to it. Of course, its adoption would be without
                            prejudice to differences of view which still exist on various points of

                            this decade of the 1960's as the United Nations Decade of Development.”
                            Within that framework, he suggested, the U.N. development efforts could
                            be expanded and coordinated.</p>

                        <p>Representatives of the US and major European countries have reached basic
                            agreement on a program to expand the resources of the International
                            Monetary Fund. The proposal was set forth by <persName corresp="#p_JP5"
                                >Per Jacobsson</persName>, Managing Director of the <gloss

                        <p>Basically the plan calls for the US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg,
                            Canada, and Japan to establish stand-by credits in their own currencies
                            to the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>. While the amount each
                            country will provide is not yet fixed, the total is expected to <pb

                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> would then have available sufficient
                            amounts of francs, lira, deutsche marks, guilder, etc. as the case may
                            be to meet any foreseeable demands on the Fund's resources, including
                            hot money flows or balance-of-payments crises of the type the US faced
                            last fall and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> faced this spring
                            and summer. At the moment, the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>,
                            after various transactions including a $1.5 billion drawing by the

                                (Ibid.)</note> is short of the European currencies, particularly
                            deutsche marks and liras.</p>
                        <p>Details of the plan including the amounts to be contributed remain to be
                            negotiated by the Executive Directors of the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> in Washington. Among the important questions yet to be
                            resolved is the autonomy to be granted the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss> to dispose of the stand-by credits. Some countries,
                            notably France and the Netherlands, have taken the position that the
                                <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> should draw upon such loans only
                            after consultations. The effect of this would be to give the lending
                            country or countries a voice in the conditions that the <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> might establish before the recipient
                            country would be granted assistance.</p>
                        <p>The major aim of the plan is to ward off speculation by demonstrating
                            that the defenses behind all the main currencies, including the dollar,
                            are adequate.</p>

                            resources; b) the additional resources must be promptly available in
                            case of need; c) safeguards will be required to ensure effective
                            consultation between the Fund and the lenders; and d) there must be no
                            weakening of the policies that have guided the Fund in the use of its
                            resources.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> devoted the bulk of his
                            speech to an exposition of US economic policies. He said that the US was
                            already on the road to recovery from the 1960 recession; the <gloss

                            Unused capacity and an ample supply of labor should avert any
                            inflationary pressures that might otherwise develop.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> reiterated the
                            Administration's determination to present a balanced budget in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> '63. We are resolute, he said, in our
                            determination to maintain both a sound and an expanding economy so that
                            the US may play its full part in the defense and the development of the
                            free world and, at the same time, meet the requirements of an increasing
                            population at home.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the US balance of payments, <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> noted that our merchandise trade surplus in 1960
                            amounted to $4.7 billion, whereas in 1959 it had been less than $1
                            billion. In the first half of 1961 our trade surplus was running at a
                            seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6 billion. But the improvement in
                            our trade surplus so far this year cannot be expected to continue in the
                            months ahead, since it was accomplished more through a decrease in
                            imports than through an increase in exports. The US is devoting
                            considerable effort to bringing marketing opportunities abroad to the
                            attention of the business community. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"
                                >Dillon</persName> also noted that the elimination of current
                            payments imbalances can be greatly facilitated by the cooperation of
                            surplus countries in pursuing liberal trade policies, in increasing
                            long-term development assistance, and in sharing expenditures for the
                            common defense in accordance with their capabilities.</p>

                            meeting, emphasized that economic development will have to be
                            accompanied by other political, social, cultural and economic
                                processes.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">For text of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s statement, September 19, see
                                ibid., pp. 579-584.</note> Economic development cannot serve its
                            real purpose if its benefits are enjoyed exclusively by a wealthy elite,
                            while the great masses remain in poverty. Nor can there be any assurance
                            of lasting benefits from economic development in any nation where the
                            government is the master of society and not its servant.</p>
                        <p>Another major problem stems from the fact that the successful achievement
                            of our humanitarian objectives depends to a considerable extent upon the
                            ability of economic growth to keep pace with demographic developments.
                            The prevailing rate of population growth affects not only the net rate
                            of economic advancement, but also the volume of resources and the nature
                            of the national programs required to achieve rapid development. Even
                            under the best of circumstances, the less-developed nations will fight a
                            losing battle, unless they can obtain, and use with maximum efficiency,
                            a huge volume of capital and technical skills. In this context, the
                            population explosion, if continued, will place an ever-increasing burden
                            on the more advanced countries and international <pb n="418"
                                xml:id="pg_418" facs="0444"/>lending institutions. It will place a
                            burden as well on the developing countries to achieve greater
                            effectiveness in mobilizing internal resources for development.</p>
                        <p>A further problem, too often neglected, is the total economic impact of
                            the development revolution on the world as a whole. Any program for
                            economic development may become an absurdity unless it reasonably takes
                            account of world trading patterns and prospects. We are only at the
                            beginning of a process in which the governments of the industrialized
                            nations must take the lead in providing an orderly opportunity for the
                            expansion of markets for the production of the under-developed
                            nations.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName>'s basic theme was that,
                            increasingly, underdeveloped countries with sound development programs
                            and well-prepared projects needing finance had reached or were reaching

                                corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> noted that during the period
                            1956-1959 more than nine-tenths of the aid extended on other than “hard”
                            terms came from the US and France. Other countries, during this period
                            and since, have become substantial lenders to the underdeveloped world,
                            but they have not yet brought themselves, to the extent that
                            circumstances require, to extend their aid on other than conventional
                            terms. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> expressed the hope
                            that lending countries will step up the flow of official capital at very
                            long term, with only a token interest burden, to avoid the kind of
                            disruption that kills peoples' hope for orderly economic progress.</p>

                            $800 million. <persName corresp="#p_BER2">Black</persName> said that
                            India and Pakistan alone could easily absorb the whole of this sum.</p>
                        <p>The US, and somewhat more cautiously Britain and Italy, gave support to
                            the idea of enlarging <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss>'s resources,
                            although the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> stressed that it could do
                            nothing more until its own finances were in better shape. The matter in
                            all probability will be brought up for action during the course of the
                            coming year.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> in its fiscal year ending June 30,
                            1961 extended credits of just over $100 million for development projects
                            in four member countries. The credits were extended on the following
                            terms—50 years, without interest, and with a ten-year grace period. A
                            service charge of 3/4 of one percent is levied. Loans signed thus far
                            include a $60 million credit to India for highways; $19 million to Chile
                            for highways; $13 million to Sudan for agriculture; and $9 million to
                            Honduras for highways.</p>

                        <p>During the past fiscal year the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>
                            extended loans totaling almost $610 million. There were 27 loans
                            bringing the total number of the Bank's loans to 292 in 57 member
                            countries. More than two-thirds of the Bank's lending is for basic
                            investment in transportation and electric power. In the past few years
                            loans for transportation have been slowly drawing ahead; this was
                            markedly in evidence in the past year with transportation loans
                            accounting for $311 million. Railway improvements made up the bulk of
                            this total, including two large loans—$70 million to India and $80
                            million to Japan for the improvement and expansion of their rail
                            services.</p>
                        <p>Electric power loans for the year totaled $125 million and were widely
                            spread throughout the world. In all, eight loans were made for this
                            purpose; one in Africa (Uganda), two in Asia (Ceylon and Japan), three
                            in Latin America (Colombia, Costa Rica, and El Salvador) and two in
                            Europe (Norway and Yugoslavia). These loans will help to add an
                            estimated one million kilowatts of capacity in the countries
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>Loans for agriculture amounted to $126 million. This total was mainly
                            accounted for by the loan of $90 million made to Pakistan as the Bank's
                            contribution to the financing of the large irrigation works required to
                            implement the settlement reached in the Indus Waters Treaty. The other
                            loans for agriculture assisted agricultural credit in British Guiana and
                            irrigation projects in Mexico and the Sudan.</p>
                        <p>Industrial lending in the past year totaled $48 million, made up of loans
                            for steel in Japan and for industrial development banks in India and
                            Pakistan.</p>
                        <p>The new loans for the year brought the cumulative total of <gloss
                                target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> loans to $5,669 million of which
                            $4,320 million had been disbursed at June 30, 1961. Of the latter
                            amount, $1,452 million had been repaid to the Bank or sold to other
                            investors.</p>
                        <p>The past year saw the highest level of activity yet reached by the Bank
                            in providing assistance to its member countries through general economic
                            surveys, which examine the development potential of the country
                            concerned and recommend the main directions which planning and
                            investment should take. The report of the general survey of Libya was
                            published in October, the Tanganyika mission report in March, and the
                            Venezuela mission report in May. A general survey of Uganda, begun last
                            September, will be published in early 1962. A large general economic
                            survey mission was sent to Spain, and recruitment began for a general
                            economic survey mission which the Bank is sending to Kenya.</p>
                        <p>To expand its technical assistance programs, <persName corresp="#p_BER2"
                                >Black</persName> announced in Vienna that the Bank is forming a
                            group of highly qualified development advisers who will be available to
                            member countries on request for extended periods of time. They will
                            perform such duties as chief or <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0446"
                            />senior economist of a general survey mission; resident economic or
                            financial adviser to a government; member of, or adviser to, a planning
                            office; administrator, or adviser to, the administrator of a development
                            program; or simply an adviser on current economic and financial
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>The task of the development adviser is not to try to impose solutions but
                            rather to illuminate the choices which governments must make if they are
                            to proceed along the road to economic growth. The choices may be among
                            the various economic sectors covered in a national program or among the
                            various projects within a sector. In any case, the development adviser's
                            job will be to present choices in orderly way, gathering cost data and
                            identifying the benefits of projects so that the government can decide
                            more confidently how fast to proceed and in what direction, given all
                            the competing claims on its financial resources.</p>

                        <p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC), another affiliate of the
                                <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, was originally established to
                            extend loans to private businesses principally in the less-developed
                            countries. The IFC has recently amended its charter so that it is now
                            able to make equity investments in new enterprises. During the fiscal
                            year ending June 30 the IFC made investments of $6.2 million, which
                            brought the cumulative total of its investments to $44.4 million. The
                            IFC has recently made commitments to provide equity-type capital to two
                            private financial institutions in Colombia. This will enable these
                            institutions to expand their investment activities over a broadening
                            range of local enterprises—chiefly smaller and medium-size concerns,
                            which it is impractical for the IFC to finance directly.</p>

                        <p>Industrialization as a means to achieve more rapid economic development
                            and the creation of a more favorable climate for the export trade of the
                            underdeveloped countries were the principle themes underlying the
                            economic resolutions adopted during the recent session of the United
                            Nations General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>It became clear early in the session that the changed voting pattern
                            under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might lead to the adoption
                            of resolutions completely unacceptable to the US. The decision was made,
                            therefore, that in order to exercise a moderating influence the US
                            would, without sacrifice of principle, view with sympathy the expressed
                            wish of the majority. To a large extent this tactic was successful. We
                            were not forced into any new major compromise to US interests during the
                            session.</p>

                        <p>A number of resolutions were approved calling on the Secretary General
                            and the subsidiary bodies of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                            take specific action looking to the early achievement of
                            industrialization in the underdeveloped countries and for the expansion
                            of their export trade. Guiding principles to achieve these two major
                            themes are contained in the resolution initiated by the US for a United
                            Nations Development Decade (<gloss target="#t_UNDD1">UNDD</gloss>) and
                            adopted unanimously by the General Assembly.<note n="1" xml:id="d193fn1"

                            other multilateral programs; a request to member governments to pursue
                            policies designed to enable the less-developed countries to sell primary
                            commodities at more stable and remunerative prices; measures to assist
                            countries in the development of their country programs; support for
                            diversification and industrialization; measures to increase the flow of
                            development capital, both public and private, to the under-developed
                            nations; establishment of aggregate growth targets for the
                            under-developed countries and other similar policies.</p>
                        <p>The US was unable to avoid the inclusion of two items in the resolution
                            which may cause concern in the future. The most hotly debated issue was
                            the proposal by the representative of Iraq that an increasing share of
                            the profit from the exploitation and marketing of natural resources by
                            foreign capital be made available to the host country. After several
                            days of intense negotiations, agreement was reached on wording calling
                            on member countries “to pursue policies designed to ensure to the
                            developing countries an equitable share of earnings from the extraction
                            and marketing of their natural resources by foreign capital in
                            accordance with the generally accepted reasonable earnings on invested
                            capital.”</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UNDD1">UNDD</gloss> resolution also contains a
                            provision inviting the Economic and Social Council to accelerate its
                            examination of and decision on principles of international economic
                            cooperation. <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> has the matter on
                            its agenda for the spring session, and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> has circulated a draft for consideration. The decision
                            which now must be made by the US and its allies is whether to oppose the
                            adoption of principles on international economic cooperation as being
                            unnecessary in view of individual resolutions already approved by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or whether a set of principles
                            containing Western views should be submitted for <gloss
                                target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> consideration. At the moment the
                            US inclines toward the latter approach since it is clear that the
                            consensus of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> membership is
                            favorable to the adoption of a set of principles in one document. It is
                            unlikely, however, that meaningful East-West agreement can be
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>As a corollary to the <gloss target="#t_UNDD1">UNDD</gloss> resolution
                            (I) the Assembly also adopted a <gloss target="#t_UNDD1">UNDD</gloss>

                            the objective of reaching $150 million for 1962 and for the Special Fund
                            to consider the advisability of establishing an information service on
                            existing and future sources of development capital and assistance.<note

                        <p>The other major initiative of the US was the proposed establishment of a
                            $100 million program for the provision of food surpluses to
                            food-deficient peoples through the United Nations system. The subject
                            was first discussed and approved by the Food and Agriculture
                            Organization in November. The US together with Canada submitted a
                            proposal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which, in addition to
                            supporting the program as approved by the <gloss target="#t_FAO1"
                                >FAO</gloss>, looked to the future when the program could be
                            expanded in size and increasing emphasis placed on the use of food for
                            economic and social development. Major opposition was encountered from
                            the food exporting countries which wished to keep the program primarily
                            one for meeting emergencies and limited to a three-year period. Many of
                            the underdeveloped food importing countries were also fearful that an
                            attempt was being made to substitute food for dollar aid. The
                            resolution, as finally adopted, was more limited in purpose than the
                            original US-Canadian proposal and reiterates throughout the necessity
                            for maintaining safeguards for the protection of food exporting
                            countries and for the development of agriculture in the developing
                                countries.<note n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">Reference is to Resolution

                            MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE FORMULATION AND EXECUTION OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC
                            POLICY</p>
                        <p rend="center">Presentation</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CH4">Harlan Cleveland</persName>, Assistant
                            Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, made the
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>We can start with the proposition that, whether pursued bilaterally or in
                            one or another of the international economic organizations in which we
                            participate (there are 49 to which we make regular contributions), our
                            purpose is to put the resources that go beyond our borders in the
                            service of our national aims, if we can figure out what the resources
                            are and what our aims are.</p>
                        <p>A standard canard used to be that we had to choose between bilateral and
                            multilateral ways of acting. This sterile argument ran out of gas after
                            about ten years. Now the canard is that we have to choose between one or
                            another of the international organizations, for example, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> versus the Latin American regional
                            arrangements. This is a sterile assumption also, because we use such
                            instruments as there are and as we use them for such particular purposes
                            as seem to give the greatest advantage.</p>
                        <p>There are a good many cases in which the multilateral arrangements served
                            where bilateral arrangements wouldn't have served as well, although most
                            of our relations will continue to be on a country-to-country basis.</p>
                        <p>In the trade field the old idea was that the way to negotiate was
                            bilaterally and apply the results to the rest of the world under
                            most-favored nation treatment. This really didn't turn out to be a very
                            good way of handling trade negotiations because it didn't take into
                            account the advantage which could be obtained through reciprocal
                            concessions from third countries. The result was that we devised <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, with a kind of round-table procedure
                            rather than an across-the-table procedure. Similarly in the payments
                            field, both the EPU and in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> were
                            considered <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0453"/>a better way to
                            provide short-term credit and monitor exchange restrictions than could
                            be done on a country-by-country basis.</p>
                        <p>In the aid field we found that the deep involvement inherent in an aid
                            program—necessary aid if to be effectively used—the interference of
                            outside people in public administration and budget processes (the very
                            stuff of sovereignty)—was a problem that could be handled if we had
                            adequate relations with a country but were difficult to work out with
                            some countries—particularly sensitive newly independent ones. The
                            working out of some functions with some countries directly through
                            international agencies has become increasingly important. It also became
                            possible to develop long-range financing in the multilateral field
                            through the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> faster than it was possible to present
                            the proposal to the American people and Congress under a bilateral
                            program.</p>
                        <p>The problem for all of us is partly to prevent ourselves and our
                            colleagues from getting so enthusiastic about one particular instrument
                            that it becomes a substitute for all the other instruments that are
                            available when we need all we have and probably others that are not
                            invented yet.</p>
                        <p>Our difficulty is that in the developmental field we have a staggering
                            number of organizations involved in the affairs of a typical
                            less-developed country. This proliferation has become a problem in
                            itself. The number of organizations which are routinely found involved
                            with the Ministry of Finance in country “X” is about 16, and in Latin
                            America it gets up to 30, counting the American agencies, the
                            international agencies and the regional agencies. You get a kind of
                            competition between these organizations in the less developed countries.
                            This puts on the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> the burden of
                            coordinating the developed countries—the very kind of burden the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> can't support.</p>
                        <p>Our problem in <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> and also in the regional
                            bureaus is first to develop some doctrine and agreement about what these
                            organizations are supposed to be doing, what we want them to do, and
                            what serves our interests for them to do.</p>
                        <p>The problem in the development field is getting the receiving countries
                            to get set up so they can coordinate the external input they require.
                            What is the best way of doing that? One way is to have fewer competitive
                            agencies trying to sell technical assistance. Part of that solution is
                            coordination on our side of the dotted line. Part of it is developing in
                            the receiving countries the capability of managing their own
                            destinies—their economic planning and financial and personnel support
                            for their plans.</p>
                        <p>These two things need to be done: a) pulling together the external
                            agencies so there are only two or three groups in each country instead
                            of 16-30, and b) getting the receiving country itself able to make
                            rational sense out of all of the input. (There should not be
                            over-emphasis on <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0454"/>health
                            projects, for example, just because the <gloss target="#t_WHO1"
                                >WHO</gloss> may be a better salesman than the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss>.)</p>
                        <p>We are beginning to make a certain amount of progress on the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> side. The Committee of Eight has now been
                            established, and the <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss> has
                            addressed itself to this problem of coordination. The establishment of
                            the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> may do the same thing with
                            respect to bilateral programs in these less-developed countries. If we
                            can get both of these enterprises further along, we may end up with two
                            groups operating in related fields—one in technical assistance and
                            preinvestment, and the other in the bigger money operations that will
                            have to be bilateral. The World Bank gets into it by consortia on the
                            money side and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special
                            representative can perform on the multilateral technical assistance
                            side. There has to be an idea as to whether the best channel of
                            influence on countries in the development of their planning machinery is
                            bilateral or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies or some other
                            form of multilateral arrangements such as the Pan American Union of the
                                <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>'s concern is
                            with multilateral organizations, he concentrated on them. Each
                            specialized agency has a budget and we are represented on all of the
                            Executive Committees of the specialized agencies. The budgets come up at
                            a moment when it is too late to do anything very much about them. Not
                            only that, but the growth of the budgets for each specialized agency is
                            really a matter of faith for most of the people going as delegates to
                            these meetings. At Agricultural meetings, for example, the Ministers of
                            Agriculture are present and of course they come to the conclusion that
                            agriculture is more important than anything else. The “budget bureau
                            nastiness” is not present at these meetings. The same thing is true in
                            the health field and, in fact, of every specialized field. We are not
                            tackling the over-all budget problem for these agencies as early as we
                                could—<hi rend="italic">i.e., when budgets are being developed
                                instead of when it becomes a problem of confidence in the agency if
                                any questions are raised</hi>.</p>
                        <p>We don't really have in our hands the raw material with which to affect
                            the budgets of these organizations. The reason is that the ambassadors
                            and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>'s have regarded themselves as
                            responsible for the bilateral relations with the country and regarded
                            these multilateral operations as the responsibility of someone else,
                            despite the fact that the US is a 40% stockholder. They regard the
                            specialized agency operations as a foreign concern—as something even
                            competing with their own programs—instead of thinking of themselves as
                            responsible for the effective operation of <gloss target="#t_FAO1"
                                >FAO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>, etc., as they
                            should be. Consequently, we don't get in Washington a flow of the
                            meaningful information at the country level with which our
                            representatives to these organizations could be intervening in the
                            budget processes early enough to make any difference.</p>
                        <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0455"/>
                        <p>We had a long discussion with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            officials about this. Their Treasury is allergic to these increased
                            budgets and said it couldn't afford more for this purpose next year. We
                            asked if they had any ideas how to carry out the Chancellor's idea not
                            to spend any more money but we didn't get the impression that they had
                            thought through the implications on the financial side. Their budget
                            people said that these increasing budgets are terrible and had to have a
                            ceiling, but there seemed no practical way to effect this and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> officials going to these meetings are
                            going along with the budgets because there is nothing else to do.</p>
                        <p>We need the assistance and cooperation both of the entire field
                            establishment of the American Government and also of the American
                            functional agencies—Agriculture, Public Health, etc. It is not going to
                            be easy or very rapid, but it is extremely important that we get a
                            better coordinated collection of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            agencies and a system for exercising our influence on their financial
                            budget processes and their programming processes that is more effective
                            than the present system. I believe these agencies as a group can be a
                            very important facility for us in getting things done inside some of the
                            less developed countries, particularly in Africa.</p>
                        <p>Another thing that it is important to focus on is the development of a
                            doctrine on the relationship between these <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> agencies and some other things we are doing in the
                            field. There is little or no documentation in this Government about the
                            place of multilateral agencies (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or
                            other) in the Alliance for Progress. The Budget Bureau very properly has
                            raised the question of whether what we put through the international
                            organizations should be counted toward the $500 million target. There
                            are the questions of what we do through the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Agencies and what we prefer to do through the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> on development planning, on technical
                            assist-ance and on coordinating capital investment programs of various
                            kinds. The fact that the capital investment program is coordinated and
                            carefully planned does not necessarily mean that we have it under
                            control. The Indus Valley is an example—this was really the first
                            consortium. It was beautifully planned; the only trouble is that the
                            cost estimates have gone up 60% and will go up 100%. We didn't really
                            have this under control. The World Bank makes determinations about bids
                            that are in excess of the planned estimates that we had agreed to
                            without clearing back with the US Government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen said we have been having a dialogue along this line. He was
                            glad Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>, after having
                            called the budget problems to our attention, put the emphasis on
                            programming. The budget is strictly a place to convey decisions, it is a
                            discipline of your operations. He has been completely frustrated in the
                            sense that they were asked to approve <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430"
                                facs="0456"/>budget requests and they found that even if they had
                            questions to raise, the time that they should have been raised was a
                            year or two ago. And when they asked what was really happening, except
                            in a few cases, they were led to believe these things were normally
                            growing and salaries were getting higher, etc. all bringing about a
                            proportional increase. When they related it back to programming, they
                            found no place where there was an evaluation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen said he found in Iran that the only answer was to establish an
                            Iranian Government office to coordinate the assistance going into Iran.
                            This was the only way to get hold of the problem. There is another
                            aspect which should be looked into at the same time—the question of
                            evaluating the particular competence of various organizations. There are
                            some elements of strategy we should think about. This came up in
                            connection with the Alliance for Progress, with respect to housing and
                            how to deal with it in the program. We could have a number of
                            organizations go in and offer assistance in housing. This could get out
                            of hand. It might be best for the US to say to these countries—if you
                            want housing assist-ance, go to the <gloss target="#t_IDB1">IDB</gloss>
                            but not to <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and other sources. This
                            could apply to other areas where we could nominate certain types of
                            funds for certain things. This is appealing in the first instance, but
                            when you turn it around and look at the capability of organizations to
                            serve the need for this, you find if they don't have competition it
                            gives rise sometimes to the worst elements of bureaucracy and is subject
                            to influence and has disabilities. Another aspect of the question is
                            where you are trying a large range of these activities you will find
                            that some things are not susceptible to being handled by a multilateral
                            organization because of problems of political interest or some other
                            reason. One area of work where <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Specialized Agencies excel is in the pre-investment study. Mr. Hansen
                            added that he hoped <persName corresp="#p_HPG1">Paul Hoffman</persName>
                            will emphasize that, e.g., geological surveys, things that do not get
                            too deeply into national planning—as that is a political area. A <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agency in the administration of finance
                            gives him the creeps, but there are other areas in which they have done
                            a tremendous job. They can do resource studies and technicians can put
                            together the standards of judgment that can be applied. But when the
                            multilateral agencies get involved in the political procedures of a
                            country, you get diminishing returns. We should analyze these things and
                            decide where it is best to put the emphasis and there is no better time
                            to do it than now, when we are trying to turn around a lot of
                            attitudes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said it is not only a
                            question of deciding whether the <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> or
                            some other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agency is a good one to do
                            the kind of thing that needs to be done, it is also a question of the
                            country. It doesn't make sense in some countries, but in other countries
                            you couldn't get inside except through a multilateral agency.</p>
                        <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0457"/>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen said we need a strategy at different levels, different things.
                            It is disheartening to see a US bilateral agency in basic competition
                            with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> or some other
                            multilateral agency when we are in effect paying 40% of that agency's
                            bill.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Coppock asked if we aren't complicating things by getting European
                            countries into the Latin American program? Why not let the Europeans be
                            predominant in some other area?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> replied that there is
                            a broader question there. The primary thrust of discussion in the <gloss
                                target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss> is to discuss among themselves what
                            they are going to do bilaterally. He wondered if <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> should not also consider what they are doing about the
                            Special Fund as they are the major contributors to the Special Fund. Of
                            course, there is a limit beyond which you can't go—setting up a kind of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> caucus in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Also, people talking in Paris may not be
                            the kind that know the tactical situation, so maybe some discussions of
                            this sort should be in New York. The caucus of the main contributors
                            isn't broad enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Coppock asked about the private groups that are providing technical
                            assistance. If our Embassies or missions are to do a better job,
                            shouldn't they take them into account too?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> replied, yes, like
                            the Ford Foundation and others.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Coppock then added that if the technical assistance were put on a
                            cash or loan basis rather than a grant basis, might not the recipient
                            country take more responsibility, so that we could drop out of the
                            picture to some extent?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said the essential
                            problem is developing an administrative fiber in the other countries to
                            do the thing that is too difficult for us. That is a difficult job.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen said there is the matter of sorting out where to ask for
                            support and from whom. The relationship very soon breaks down when you
                            have a lot of agencies in a country. You have, in effect, the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> dealing with the Ministry of
                            Agriculture, and you have other agencies dealing with other ministries.
                            It is a question of the proper utilization of these people. The resident
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or specialized agency
                            representative can't do much about it. It is hard to pull a man out if
                            this kicks back and the Foreign Minister steps in. In Iran we tried an
                            experiment that worked because we had a Central Planning Organization.
                            The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> detailed people to the Central
                            Organization and the Central Organization took the responsibility for
                            detailing them to the other ministries and when they weren't needed, it
                            pulled them back and reassigned them elsewhere—something an outside
                            agency couldn't do. In talking with many resident representatives, Mr.
                            Hansen found it was not just the problem of disengagement but also the
                            quid pro quos required—space, secretaries, etc. They (the resident
                            representatives) are inhibited unless there is a central place in the
                            government to exert discipline.</p>
                        <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0458"/>
                        <p>Mr. Coppock asked if there is any real effort to get from the missions
                            abroad a real size-up of the programs going on there?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kaplan replied that a message was sent out early this year for the
                            first time trying to get them to do something more than estimating what
                            the various <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies would contribute
                            to the country. We asked this year for an evaluation. We received very
                            few answers before we had to get ready for the budget.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said that even in the
                            Congo, the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> country study says that
                            it (the country team) knows nothing about the technical assist-ance
                            programs coming from the various specialized agencies. He doesn't know
                            why not. Every country study as a matter of course should look at these
                            technical assistance programs and regard them as ours as we are 40%
                            stockholders.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kaplan said there is a problem of coordination between technical
                            assistance and capital assistance as a whole. Much of the problem of
                            coordination of technical assistance takes care of itself—the
                            agricultural group works with the Ministry of Agriculture, the health
                            group with the health organization. That coordination is less
                            significant than coordination of all the assistance that is going in,
                            what bilateral arrangements there are, whether technical assistance is
                            outstripping the availability of capital. In some areas there is a
                            serious shortage of technical assistance while large amounts of capital
                            are going into a country. This is true of management services. Lots of
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s have received much less
                            technical assistance in training of managers and much more for training
                            of people in agriculture, public health, etc. This is partly because of
                            the availability of technicians and specialists in the agricultural and
                            public health fields and partly because no specialized agency has
                            managers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ioanes asked what we should do that we are not doing now?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> replied that the one
                            most important ingredient is to use the field establishment of the US
                            Government to work on this problem rather than just the Washington
                            agencies. Use of this information in a logical fashion by delegates to
                            all sorts of conferences and by resident representatives of the US with
                            the various specialized agencies will mean that we can help manage these
                            budgets rather than being in our present ineffectual position. There
                            will be resistance to this—the reaction will be, “We are doing too much
                            and shouldn't take this on.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ioanes then asked how we can help in this area when you talk about
                            planning and coordination in the field?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName>'s reply was that
                            Agriculture's case is most direct when we come to the <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> budget—it went up 40% and there was
                            nothing the US could do about it. That budget had started two years
                            ago.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Coppock asked if anyone knew whether it is practical to get these
                            reports in.</p>
                        <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0459"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said he was not sure
                            that doing it once a year is the right thing. It should be rounded up
                            when the country book is done, but it may be more complex than that. He
                            thinks there is an opportunity here and spoke about it in a session with
                            regional assistant secretaries a couple of days ago. He said he is
                            trying to build a basis of consent for a strong instruction to go
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hansen remarked there might first be an across-the-board approach on
                            a minimum level. It might be that we should pinpoint particular areas to
                            be worked on intensively, including having a group to look into the
                            programs—go to these key countries and make evaluations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH4">Cleveland</persName> said this is right.
                            We might get some kind of a private organization—such as Rand—to
                            investigate this problem in some of the key countries and perhaps take a
                            whole new look at some of the specialized agencies. The specialized
                            agencies go on from year to year without any one saying whether or not
                            they should be doing this at all. For example, the Atomic Energy Agency
                            was set up on two basic assumptions—one that uranium would be in short
                            supply and the other that there would be commercial use of atomic power
                            before long. Both assumptions were wrong, but we still have the
                                agency.<gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> has a study going on
                            that.</p>

                                >Telegram 2906 from USUN, February 27, argued that the Cuban project
                                could not be delayed beyond early May. It also urged the Department
                                to try to accelerate the hearings on the bond issue and get them out
                                of the way as soon as possible, and asked it to consider utilization
                                of an Italian firm for execution of the Cuban project, including
                                Italian lira for payment. (Ibid., 398.051/2-2762)</note> In its
                            numerous discussions with Special Fund officials on the Cuban project,
                            USUN has included the four points cited in refairgram. The Department
                            will recall that in his statement to the Governing Council in May 1961,
                            in which the four points cited in refairgram were made, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KPM3">Klutznick</persName> concluded by
                            saying: “We are confident that the project will not proceed until the
                            staff has satisfied itself (emphasis supplied) about the questions we
                            have raised and is certain that the project can be completed
                            successfully to the ultimate benefit of the Cuban people.”</p>
                        <p>Following this statement, the Governing Council approved the project,
                            despite reservations by the US and several other members on the
                            technical matters cited by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KPM3"
                                >Klutznick</persName>. Subsequently, the staffs of the Special Fund
                            and <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> made a thorough examination of
                            the questions we raised and concluded that there are no technical,
                            administrative or economic obstacles to successful implementation of
                            this project. The Special Fund has assured USUN, however, that the
                            project would be discontinued if new circumstances arise which would
                            make its successful implementation appear doubtful. The carefully
                            drafted operations agreement includes safeguards to give the Special
                            Fund the authority to do this.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the four specific points raised by the Department, USUN
                            has the following comments: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Special Fund is convinced that the Cuban Government will
                                    cooperate in implementation of this project (despite their
                                    attitudes toward <gloss target="#t_IAIAS1">IAIAS</gloss>)
                                    because they have cooperated fully to date and appear anxious to
                                    see this project proceed expeditiously. As noted in USUN <gloss

                                <item>The Special Fund feels that the aftermath of a revolution
                                    invariably brings about important personnel changes in any
                                    government. Both the Special Fund and <gloss target="#t_FAO1"
                                        >FAO</gloss> are convinced, however, that the Cuban
                                    Government will assign the qualified personnel needed by this
                                    project.</item>

                                <item>With respect to the question of livestock slaughter and other
                                    misuse of resources, the Special Fund reviews each project
                                    request on its merits and in relation to other requests
                                    received. Whatever the completely accurate facts were it is the
                                    judgment of Fund and <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> they do
                                    not justify failing to go ahead with long run project calculated
                                    to benefit Cuban people.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Special Fund and <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> are
                                    convinced that this project will not overlap or otherwise be
                                    inconsistent with any other activities underway in Cuba. As
                                    noted above, the question of whether there is a real need for
                                    this project and whether this need is more urgent than the needs
                                    of other countries interested in Special Fund assistance was
                                    assessed by the <gloss target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> and the
                                    Special Fund on the basis of a careful on-the-spot study of the
                                    project request and a solid review on the one hand, and an
                                    examination of other project requests received, on the other.
                                    The existence of needs generally not pertinent this matter.
                                    Special Fund can only act upon requests of governments.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>USUN is fully aware of the issues raised by this project and shares the
                            Department's view that in terms of our present policy toward Cuba, it
                            would be desirable to eliminate it. However, this project was properly
                            processed in accordance with the regulations of the Special Fund, to
                            which the US is committed, and there is no legitimate way of stopping
                            it. If we go much further in attempting to eliminate this project, the
                            standing of the Special Fund as a truly international institution will
                            be compromised. Moreover, we would destroy <persName corresp="#p_HPG1"
                                >Paul Hoffman</persName> as an international figure who enjoys the
                            full confidence of the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and of the
                            underdeveloped countries. It must be remembered that <gloss
                                target="#t_FAO1">FAO</gloss> has complete record of completing all
                            preliminary work necessary this project. It must also be remembered
                            other countries have interest and are not uninformed. Any unaccountable
                            delay or failure to act reasonable time before Governing Council meeting
                            May can set stage for developments that could be tragically
                            counterproductive US objectives.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_HPG1">Hoffman</persName> is now
                            responsible for working out the program for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Development Decade, a proposal originating with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, which may have
                            a profound effect on the future economic and social work of the <gloss

                            damage <persName corresp="#p_HPG1">Hoffman</persName>'s standing, we
                            destroy one of the greatest assets we have in the United Nations and in

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>, Since President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, in his eloquent address at the
                            United Nations, proclaimed the decade of the 1960s as “The United
                            Nations Development Decade”, an effort has been underway at the United
                            Nations to intensify substantially and speedily its activities in the
                            economic and social fields. Acting Secretary-General <persName
                                corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> has assumed personal leadership.
                            He has strengthened the Economic Policy Board to assure effective
                            coordination of development activities within the Secretariat. He has
                            sought and obtained assurances of full cooperation from the Specialized
                            Agencies.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary-General has placed on me primary responsibility for
                            obtaining the necessary financial support for an expanded pre-investment
                            programme. The needs for 1963 can be stated very simply. For 1962 we
                            have contributions and pledges for the Special Fund and the Expanded
                            Programme of Technical Assistance of approximately $100 million. For
                            1963 we must have $150 million. The minimum requirement of the Expanded
                            Programme is $50 million; of the Special Fund $100 million. This I am
                            prepared to document if desired.</p>
                        <p>I am reasonably confident that the target figure of $150 million can be
                            reached provided the United States contributes the $60 million it has
                            conditionally pledged. The condition is, of course, that $90 million be
                            obtained from other sources. There is no question in my mind that $90
                            million can be obtained from other sources—that is not the problem. The
                                <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0463"/>problem is securing from
                            the United States Government a sensible administrative decision as to
                            which contributions from other sources, particularly recipient
                            Governments, can be counted for matching purposes.</p>
                        <p>Five types of contributions are made by the recipient Governments. Each
                            of these is a crucial contribution to development, representing the
                            mobilization of scarce material resources by the low-income countries
                            themselves for the success of vital projects. Here are the five types of
                            contributions:</p>
                        <p>a) Voluntary contributions to Special Fund gross resources, centrally
                            collected and audited.</p>
                        <p rend="right">(matched by the US Government)</p>
                        <p>b) Local operating costs, amounting to 15% of expert costs—centrally
                            collected and audited and merged with gross resources to form an
                            unidentified part of Governing Council allocations, which are
                            administered by the Executing Agency.</p>
                        <p rend="right">(matched by the US Government)</p>
                        <p>c) Cash counterpart contributions, centrally collected and audited and
                            merged with gross resources to form an unidentified part of Governing
                            Council allocations, which are administered by the Executing Agency.</p>
                        <p rend="right">(not matched by the US Government)</p>
                        <p>d) Cash counterpart contributions which are administered by the
                            Government or jointly with the Executing Agency but are not processed
                            through the Special Fund accounts and are not merged with gross Special
                            Fund resources.</p>
                        <p rend="right">(not matched by the US Government)</p>
                        <p>e) Counterpart contributions in kind, consisting of services, facilities
                            and plant provided by the recipient Government as an integral part of
                            the project, appraised and evaluated by the Special Fund.</p>
                        <p rend="right">(not matched by the US Government)</p>
                        <p>The question as to which of the three forms—((c) through (e) above)—the
                            counterpart financial contribution will take is decided by the Special
                            Fund entirely on the basis of operational considerations. So far as the
                            Governments are concerned the costs are the same, whether the
                            contribution is in cash paid over to the Fund, in cash controlled by the
                            Government, or in the form of services or physical facilities, and the
                            cost is in all cases determined and specified in the contract (plan of
                            operations) with the Government.</p>
                        <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0464"/>
                        <p>The distinction presently made by the US Government in determining which
                            type of contribution it will consider in making its matching voluntary
                            payments to the Special Fund, based on the form in which the
                            contribution is made, is arbitrary and appears to be illogical. The
                            legislation authorizes matching of local costs payments, and all
                            counterpart provisions are of course made in respect of local currency
                            costs. A question might arise concerning the evaluation or appraisal of
                            counterpart turned over <hi rend="italic">in kind</hi> to the project,
                            though, if desired a detailed and impartial appraisal of the value of
                            such contributions could easily be arranged. There can be no question
                            concerning the amounts of cash which have been made available by the
                            Government, as these are a matter of accounting record.</p>
                        <p>It is especially difficult to follow the distinction made by the United
                            States Government between local operating costs (15% of experts' costs)
                            paid by the recipient Government, which are matched, and other
                            counterpart cash paid over to and administered by the Special Fund. Both
                            are paid in respect of local costs; both are centrally collected and
                            audited, and thus meet the requirement in the fine print of the
                            legislation; both are taken into the gross resources of the Fund, form
                            part of the earmarking from the Governing Council and their disbursement
                            is completely controlled by the Fund. There is, in short, no distinction
                            between the way in which these two forms of counterpart cash are handled
                            by the Fund.</p>
                        <p>Acceptance by the United States Government of one form of counterpart
                            cash payment for matching at the exclusion of other forms gives rise to
                            a number of anomalies, some of which are listed below: <list>
                                <item>—Governments are required to make two cash counterpart
                                    payments instead of one: the first amounting to 15% of expert
                                    programme costs (in order to obtain US matching); the second to
                                    cover the balance of counterpart obligation as determined by the
                                    Fund. This requirement is not understood by the Government, and
                                    makes for double bookkeeping locally and at headquarters. Cash
                                    payments, when received, have to be identified as to category,
                                    which further complicates the matter.</item>
                                <item>—Certain projects do not have an expert component per se, or
                                    the expert component is in the form of consulting contractors,
                                    so that the expert component can only with difficulty be
                                    identified. Nevertheless, in order to obtain US matching, the
                                    Fund has attempted to make these determinations.</item>
                                <item>—Projects executed by the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1"
                                        >IBRD</gloss> normally and for good reason involve contracts
                                    between the Government and the consulting firm direct, under
                                    which the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> uses Special
                                    Fund financing to reimburse the Government (as a maximum) for
                                    that portion of the total contract cost which was in foreign
                                    exchange. All local currency costs are paid to the firm by the
                                    Government from its own resources. In order to obtain the US <pb
                                        n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0465"/>matching payments the
                                    Special Fund was for a time attempting to identify expert
                                    programme costs, assess the government 15% for local costs,
                                    receive the money from the Government, pay it to the <gloss
                                        target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, which would then use it to
                                    reimburse the Government for a portion of the local costs it was
                                    paying the firm. This is the reductio ad absurdum of the whole
                                    arrangement, and the Fund has given it up, and foregone the US
                                    matching payments in such cases.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Governments cannot understand why their counterpart payments must be
                            subdivided; there is no difference in treatment of the two payments by
                            the Fund; there is no difference in their value either to the Government
                            or to the Fund, except that the United States Government had decided to
                            match one and not the other.</p>
                        <p>In your consideration of how these contributions by recipient Governments
                            should be classified for matching purposes may I suggest that there are
                            two additional and very important issues involved in your
                            decision—first, obtaining the maximum amount of development possible
                            from the dollars invested by the United States and second, strengthening
                            the United Nations. Proof that more development can be obtained per
                            dollar by channelling, as far as possible, aid through the United
                            Nations rests in a very simple set of figures. The Governing Council of
                            the United Nations Special Fund to date has approved 205 projects
                            calling for total expenditures of $415 million. The United States
                            contribution to these projects is approximately $70 million, or less
                            than 17 per cent. The fact that the United Nations will be strengthened
                            by increasing its capacity to assist the less-developed countries in
                            speeding their development is obvious. It has shown up in votes in the
                            United Nations time and again when efforts have been made either to
                            weaken or destroy the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>In closing may I say that we at the United Nations are eager to make a
                            reality of the United Nations Development Decade, further that we want
                            to get started now, and finally, that we are very much in need of your
                            help.</p>

                                    <p>Our conversation then turned to the top jobs in the <gloss

                                        the US could not have the number 1 and number 2 man in the

                                    <p>Concerning the top job in the <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                            >IMF</gloss>, I suggested that <persName
                                            corresp="#p_JP5">Jacobsson</persName>'s successor should
                                        be someone a good deal more flexible and sympathetic to new
                                        devices to deal with the free world liquidity problem. I
                                        suggested that this problem was not yet acute but that it
                                        could become difficult later on in this decade if gold
                                        production continued to lag substantially behind the growth
                                        in world trade. I pointed out further that Britain's entry
                                        into the Common Market would aggravate the liquidity problem
                                        by weakening and perhaps eventually destroying the sterling
                                        area, so that the overseas members of the area would
                                        gradually transfer their sterling balances into other
                                        currencies. In short, we face a prospect of an aggravation
                                        of the British payments problem as well as the prospect of a
                                        long term US payments problem and some means might have to
                                        be found to take pressure off the dollar and sterling as the
                                        two reserve currencies of the free world by some
                                        institutional innovation beyond the recent Vienna agreement
                                        which would provide real “collective security” in free world
                                        financing. <persName corresp="#p_LJM2">Leddy</persName> said
                                        that the Treasury did not think there was a liquidity
                                        problem now but agreed there might well be one as the decade
                                        proceeds. I suggested that someone like Sir Oliver Franks,
                                        who appears to be impressed with the liquidity problem,
                                        might be the sort of person who should succeed <persName

                            who could work closely with us in implementing the Development Decade.
                            At this point I have the feeling that no one in his shop is really
                            interested, which is unfortunate, since Treasury will have a lot to say
                            when US position papers are drafted which have financial implications.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Paul</hi>: The Secretary has asked me to reply
                            to your letter of March 1, 1962,<note n="1" xml:id="d199fn1"><ref
                                    target="#d196">Document 196</ref>.</note> wherein you discuss
                            the future course of the Special Fund <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444"
                                facs="0470"/>and especially your desires for additional matching by
                            the United States Government of contributions made by other recipient
                            governments. As you know, we indicated that Departmental staff would
                            examine carefully your proposals in the light of the new initiatives
                            connected with the Decade of Development and previous Congressional
                            guidelines expressed in legislation governing our contributions to the
                            Special Fund.</p>
                        <p>Our preliminary examination leads us to the conclusion that we should
                            explore the possibility of matching the cash counter-part contributions
                            which are centrally collected and audited, and administered by the
                            Special Fund. These contributions—although project costs—appear to be
                            somewhat similar to the local operating costs which are also centrally
                            collected and audited and merged with the gross resources. However, I
                            have asked that more data be secured on the types of costs covered by
                            such contributions and the extent to which countries receiving Special
                            Fund assistance provide this type of contribution.</p>
                        <p>It is our belief that cash counter-part contributions which are not
                            processed through the Special Fund accounts and counter-part
                            contributions in kind should not be matched. This belief is predicated
                            on intent of Congress which has been rather clearly expressed. One of
                            the ways in which the Congress intends to retain control of the matching
                            contribution is that of matching funds deposited into the central
                            accounts of the Special Fund. The stipulation in the <gloss
                                target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> legislation that we may only match
                            “assessed and audited local costs” is another measure of control which
                            cannot very well be exercised on contributions administered by
                            governments or counter-part contributions in kind.</p>
                        <p>Further, I believe the Department must present a well justified case to
                            the Congress so as not to cause a recurrence of the moves made several
                            years ago to reduce the matching proviso to a lesser percentage.</p>
                        <p>As we move ahead on this proposition I must indicate the concern felt by
                            a number of us about the large cash balances now existing in the Special
                            Fund. I realize that many of the Special Fund projects require
                            considerable time in terms of negotiating operations agreements and
                            getting projects going, which in some cases may require three or four
                            years to complete. However, given the close scrutiny now being made of
                            the programs and budgets of all international organizations, I would
                            hope that you might find ways to speed up the initial phases of the
                            implementation process. I recall during your recent visit that one of
                            the suggestions we discussed was the possibility of utilizing private
                            contractors who might move ahead on projects which cannot now be handled
                            by executive agencies within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                family.<note n="2" xml:id="d199fn2">An apparent reference to

                            decrease in the amounts made available but might influence the timing of
                            our payments.</p>

                        <p>On the economic side, the Council's discussions were dominated by two
                            main themes—the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Development Decade and
                            the holding of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> conference on trade
                            and development. Within the context of the discussions on these
                            subjects, the traditional preoccupation of the Council—commodity
                            problems, rate of growth, need for industrialization, inadequacy of
                            capital—were given the usual attention. Underlying much of the debate
                            was evident concern as to the effect on other countries of the European
                            Common Market.</p>

                        <p>The idea of a Development Decade has taken hold, particularly among the
                            less-developed countries. They resisted Soviet bloc attempts to play it
                            down.</p>
                        <p>The item was introduced by the Secretary General in a well balanced talk.
                            He was followed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAEII1"
                                >Stevenson</persName> who placed considerable emphasis on the
                            importance of the human factor in economic development. Two competing
                            resolutions were put forward: one by Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Senegal
                            and Yugoslavia, the other by Denmark, El Salvador, and the US. Our
                            delegation took the lead in combining the two. The resulting resolution
                            was subject to protracted negotiation, first with the sponsors of the
                            other resolution, then with many Western powers and finally with Poland
                            and the Soviet Union. (When the Soviet delegation found it could not
                            sabotage or avoid a resolution, it tried, unsuccessfully, to include in
                            the resolution a mechanism for a ten-year world-wide plan modeled after
                            bloc kind of planning.)</p>
                        <p>The final resolution was of an umbrella character with fourteen points

                            things, the resolution calls on member governments to give particular
                            attention in the first years of the Decade to industrial development;
                            improved access to world markets for the developing countries;

                            on September 14, 1962, in which he urged support for a U.S. proposal to
                            increase the capital of the International Development Association from
                            $1 to $4 billion over the next several years. The International Monetary

                            signed the plan of operations that allowed the agricultural project in
                            Cuba to proceed. <persName corresp="#p_HPG1">Hoffman</persName> approved
                            the project after receiving confirmation from the Food and Agriculture
                            Organization about technical points he had raised. The plan of operation
                            included provision for three phases, the first of which would determine
                            whether suitable working arrangements would permit the implementation of
                            the second and third phases.</p>

                            made two statements that reiterated U.S. objections to the U.N. project.

                                (Ibid.) The Part I countries were Australia, Austria, Canada,
                                Denmark, Finland, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan,
                                Kuwait, the Netherlands, Norway, Union of South Africa, Sweden, the

                            over-all target for Part I countries of $250 million per annum for 3
                            years, payment commencing 1965. Informed group of U.S. willingness make
                            final offer of $100 million as its share, conditional on $250 million
                            package actually being reached. Also indicated willingness four other
                            large countries make following contributions: <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> $30.7 million; Germany $24.4 million; France $19.4

                            $65.7 million to be found among remaining 13 Part I countries. Stated
                            belief that certain members of group would feel improvement their
                            financial and economic position since 1959 when <gloss target="#t_IDA1"
                                >IDA</gloss> shares first negotiated would warrant increase in their
                            relative share. Reiterated importance U.S. attached to reaching rapidly
                            $250 million total and emphasized need for early action in view
                            decreasing availability <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> resources
                            for new commitments and tightness of legislative schedules in several
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Group agreed to have a follow-up meeting May 27 to review responses by
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>In discussion, Bullitt avoided tying individual country subscriptions to
                            precise formula but noted that increase from present level <gloss
                                target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> subscriptions roughly $150 million per
                            year to proposed level of $250 million per year would require minimum
                            increase by factor of 1.66 in other's contributions and urged those in
                            an improved position to consider greater increase.</p>

                            agricultural credit and new industries, long-term financing for the

                                salutation was handwritten by Wilson.</note> Once or twice lately
                            you have emphasised to <persName corresp="#p_WGD1">George
                                Woods</persName> and to me how important it is in your view that all
                            the capital exporting countries should be fully aware of the
                            indebtedness and debtservicing problems of the borrowing countries. You
                            may be interested to know what the Bank is at present doing in this
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>In the first place, our staff, as a matter of routine, produces reports
                            on the economic situation and prospects for each of the countries to
                            which we make Bank loans or <gloss target="#t_IDA1">IDA</gloss> credits.
                            These reports contain all the available debt information about that
                            country and they also contain an analysis of the debt burden. Secondly,
                            four or five times a year we prepare reports on the external public debt
                            of a selected group of countries—each debtor country appears once a
                            year. I enclose copies of our last two reports of this kind. They
                            contain statistical information only, without any analysis and, like the
                            country reports referred to above, they show scheduled amortization and
                            interest payments for the next fifteen years.</p>
                        <p>Both these reports are circulated to the Executive Directors of the Bank
                            among whom, of course, all the <gloss target="#t_DAC1">DAC</gloss>
                            countries are represented. In addition, a copy of the external public
                            debt statistical report is sent to the <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> Secretariat in Paris.</p>
                        <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>All the above material is collected from the borrowing countries. We also
                            receive information from the creditor countries about their claims.
                            Under a special “exchange of information” arrangement, the Bank receives
                            six-monthly statements from each of the fourteen major creditor
                            countries on their scheduled receipts of amortization and interest,
                            during the next ten years, from the public and private sectors in each
                            debtor country. We process this information here and circulate, to the
                            creditor countries only (and also to the <gloss target="#t_DAC1"
                                >DAC</gloss> Secretariat), figures showing the total debt position
                            of each borrowing country. I enclose our latest version of this report
                            for your information.<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Finally, the Bank staff occasionally undertakes comprehensive analyses of
                            the debt servicing burden and debt servicing ability of all or most of
                            the borrowing countries. One such analysis was published in 1958 and
                            another in 1960.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">Neither found.</note> We
                            are now up-dating the earlier publications and the new study should be
                            completed in a few months' time and will be available to the <gloss

                        <p>All this may sound quite impressive, so I should add that we are not
                            satisfied with the scope or form of our information and we are actively
                            considering how it might be improved.<note n="5" xml:id="d207fn5">In

                        <p>In your special message of February 6 to the Congress,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d208fn1">See <ref target="#d2">Document 2</ref>.</note> you
                            stated that in negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
                            Trade (<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>), the United States would
                            seek the fullest possible measure of tariff reduction by foreign
                            countries as a means of helping to correct the balance-of-payments
                            deficit.</p>
                        <p>In these negotiations, the United States will have to offer tariff
                            concessions to other countries in order to obtain from them tariff
                            concessions which will provide improved market opportunities for United
                            States exporters. Unfortunately, the authority available to our
                            negotiators to offer reductions in United States tariffs is not
                            sufficient to assure achievement of the results we need to obtain in
                            these important negotiations. If necessary, I will submit
                            recommendations to you in the course of the negotiations for augmenting
                            this authority. At this time, I want to explain the background and bring
                            to your attention the potential seriousness of the situation.</p>
                        <p>On May 27, 1960, the interagency trade agreements organization issued

                                interdepartmental Trade Agreements Committee (<gloss
                                    target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss>).</note> Because of the careful
                            selectivity exercised in its preparation, the list represented only 26.3
                            percent of our total imports in 1959 from the countries with which we
                            contemplate negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The trade agreements legislation provides that the Tariff Commission
                            shall conduct an investigation of the products on the public list and
                                <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0482"/>with respect to each item,
                            report to the President, for his information, the level below which
                            individual duties could not be reduced without causing or threatening
                            serious injury to domestic industry. Although there is nothing in the
                            legislation to prevent the President from reducing duties below the
                            level (peril point) found by the Tariff Commission, if he does so, he is
                            required to report his reasons to the Congress. The Tariff Commission
                            found, in its peril point investigation, that the duties on products
                            accounting for nearly one-third of the trade coverage of the list could
                            not be decreased without causing or threatening such serious injury.</p>
                        <p>In light of the known views of the <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> administration against breaching peril points
                            in trade agreement negotiations, the interdepartmental Trade Agreements
                            Committee (<gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss>) did not recommend any
                            reductions in rates of duty which would have breached peril points. The
                                <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> had been prepared, however,
                            prior to receipt of the peril points, to recommend reductions on many
                            products important to the negotiations on which the Tariff Commission
                            subsequently reported the peril point to be the existing tariff level.
                            The recommendations of the <gloss target="#t_TAC1">TAC</gloss> on offers
                            to be made in the negotiations were approved by the President on January
                            6, 1961.<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p>The limitations resulting from the Tariff Commission's adverse peril
                            point findings have reduced the trade coverage of the approved offers to
                            only 18 percent of our total imports from countries with which we expect
                            to negotiate. The statutory authority of the President in these
                            negotiations is not great, authorizing him to make reductions in duty of
                            no more than 20 percent of the existing duty, by stages, except in the
                            case of certain duties in excess of 50 percent ad valorem or below 10
                            percent ad valorem where the authority is somewhat greater. Since we
                            will seek from other countries tariff reductions of much greater depth
                            than we will be able to offer in return, we need to be able to make
                            reductions on as broad an amount of trade coverage as possible.</p>
                        <p>In the case of some countries we will be able to offer concessions on
                            less than one percent of our imports from them, with the result that the
                            negotiations would be either very meager or without any basis at all.
                            The reduced bargaining potential with the European Economic Community
                                (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>), where the attrition caused by
                            peril points is nearly 38 percent, is particularly serious. It is
                            possible that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will agree to
                            settle for less than full reciprocity on the offer it has already made
                            to reduce its future common external tariff by 20 percent provided
                            adequate reciprocity is offered by other countries in return. There is a
                            serious risk, however, that the negotiating power available to the
                            United States negotiators will not be sufficient to induce the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to implement its offer fully, and that
                            we will be unable to accomplish our objective of furthering the
                            interests of <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0483"/>the United States
                            by securing the lowest possible level in the new <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> common external tariff as well as substantial tariff
                            reductions by other countries.</p>
                        <p>If we find that increased authority is required in order to permit our
                            aims in these negotiations to be accomplished, the only feasible course
                            would be to breach some peril points on a selective basis. In such
                            event, recommendations would be submitted to you as to the particular
                            products on which the breaching of peril points in these negotiations
                            would be in the national interest.</p>
                        <p>You will receive, in due course, the recommendations of the interagency
                            Trade Agreements Committee on requests for authority to offer tariff
                            concessions on articles selected from the supplementary list, issued by
                            the Committee on November 23, 1960,<note n="4" xml:id="d208fn4">For text

                            supplementary list, it will be impossible, because of the limitations of

                            sufficiently to have a significant effect on the problem here

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to the
                            Commonwealth arrangements regarding tropical food stuffs which caused us
                            trouble because of Latin America. He hoped that we could approach this
                            matter together.</p>
                        <p>The President explained that we were going to have an extremely difficult
                            battle on reciprocal trade legislation. Last time the bill passed the
                            House by only one vote. Now there were depressed conditions. The textile
                            industry had moved to the South which had traditionally supported free
                            trade. 35-40 Congressmen were coming to see him next week. Reciprocal
                            trade would be the most important battle of the next two years. Some of
                            the arguments used by the opponents were soundly based. We must organize
                            those who benefit from free trade. Those who are hurt are already
                            organized. It would help us a great deal on this question if the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could do something about deciduous fruit.
                            This matter was of particular concern to six Senators from the Northwest
                            who supported us on reciprocal trade. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said that he would be glad to furnish the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> with a memorandum on the subject.</p>
                        <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0486"/>
                        <p>The President next referred to the difficulties occasioned by the growth
                            in imports of textiles from Hong Kong. These imports had gone up 400%
                            and are now equivalent to those from Japan. Something must be done or
                            there could be a disastrous effect on the reciprocal trade legislation.
                            Pakistan was also somewhat involved. The President said he would like us
                            jointly to see if something could be done voluntarily.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the problem of fruits the Prime Minister said the British
                            interest was to avoid ruining the Federation of the West Indies and
                            having it taken over by a Castro-type regime. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> observed that it would help if
                            something could be done about peaches and pears which he did not think
                            involved the Federation. The Prime Minister replied that he thought this
                            could be straightened out. He added the matter of textiles was terribly
                            difficult. Great Britain had voluntary quotas from Hong Kong and
                            Pakistan but these were about to run out. If the West gives aid to new
                            countries to set up industries, they are bound to manufacture. What do
                            we do with these products? For example, Lancaster had shifted from the
                            manufacture of textiles to high-grade machinery. The British Government
                            had spent much money to change the type of manufacture. The problem
                            arises when a new source comes so quickly into the market. This upsets
                            things politically and then one cannot get things done. He would like to
                            have the Hong Kong matter studied. The Prime Minister asked whether it
                            would be possible to obtain a voluntary quota. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DHSAF1">Lord Home</persName> said it had taken the
                            British three years. Mr. Ball reported that when in London last week he
                            had spoken with Mr. Gorrell Barnes of the Colonial Office and they had
                            reached an understanding that the British would send over a mission next
                            week to look at the total economic problem of Hong Kong not only the
                            commercial policy aspects. The broader problem the Prime Minister had
                            mentioned, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said, was
                            pre-occupying us very much. He hoped it might be handled through the
                                <gloss target="#t_DAG1">DAG</gloss>. There should be coordination
                            and planning regarding the type of development we would support and also
                            regarding the burden of absorbing imports.</p>

                            <item>Mr. Sato Kiichiro (introduced by Ambassador Asakai) and members of

                        </list>
                        <p>The President met the Delegation in the Cabinet Room at 3:20 and spoke
                            with them for ten or twelve minutes. He was assured by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_AK5">Asakai</persName> that all present spoke
                            English. The President was introduced to and shook hands with each
                            member of the Delegation and inquired regarding the individual's
                            business connections.</p>
                        <p>The President was fully briefed and effective in his conversation. He
                            said the Administration recognized that Japan lived by trade and that
                            the Administration proposed an expansive policy rather than a
                            restrictive one. He indicated, however, that domestic pressures were
                            often against imports and that beneficiaries of foreign trade were
                            seldom articulate; the cotton growers in North and South Carolina who
                            did good business with Japan remained mute, while his neighbors in the
                            textile industry were vociferous in their complaints.</p>
                        <p>The President said he had been studying the textile situation and had for
                            two weeks in his office a chart showing imports. This (which an aide
                            produced within a minute or two) showed that Japan by its own efforts
                            had kept the volume relatively level at some 180-odd million yards but
                            that others, notably Hong Kong, had been unrestrained in their exports
                            which moved steadily up on his chart to 187 million yards. Something
                            needed to be done to correct this inequity, according to the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he hoped for closer economic relationships
                            between the United States and Japan and between the United States/Japan
                            and Europe, adding that he hoped also that a basis for such
                            relationships could be maintained in the other American Republics.</p>
                        <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>When some of the visitors were identified as being in the
                            radio-television and heavy electrical industries, the President said
                            laughingly that in the United States these occupations were mostly the
                            bailiwick of Republicans, nevertheless, he got along pretty well with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The President did not mention anything about continued import
                            restrictions on Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sato's brief acknowledgment expressed great appreciation on the part
                            of the delegation for the President taking time out of what must be an
                            exceedingly harrowing schedule to greet the Japanese mission. The
                            President shook hands with each of the visitors, the Ambassador and a
                            representative of the Embassy when he took his leave.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> explained that our

                                was held in Geneva May 29, 1961-July 16, 1962.</note> on the
                            assumption that differences in the agricultural field would be worked
                            out while the Dillon Round was in progress. Mr. <persName

                            attitude in rejecting the US proposals without apparently giving them
                            serious consideration jeopardized the whole structure of the <gloss

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized the importance
                            of the Dillon Round to the United States and particularly to the
                            continuation of our liberal trade policies. He noted that should
                            difficulties in the agricultural area at this time lead to a failure to
                            use our negotiating powers in a new round of negotiations, protectionist
                            pressures in the United States will be strengthened and this would
                            endanger the continuance of our liberal trade policies and the extension
                            of the Reciprocal Trade Act, which comes up for renewal in Congress next
                            year. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he could
                            not emphasize too strongly the importance to us of an outcome in the

                            again that he hoped Mr. Spaak and the Council of Ministers would take
                            note at the May 2 meeting of the great importance the United States
                            attached to a change in the Commission's stand on our agricultural

                        <p>On May 2, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            announced a 7-point program to help the U.S. textile industry. He asked
                            the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Treasury, and State, the Small
                            Business Administration, and Congress to carry out specific tasks: to
                            promote an expended program of research, tax and investment incentives,
                            financial aid for plant modernization; to correct domestic cotton
                            pricing system to help U.S. textile producers; to pass legislation
                            providing assistance to industries hurt by increased imports; to explore
                            escape-clause provision for 12 textile products; and to convene a
                            multilateral conference of textile countries to expand trade. For text

                        <p>These proposals were discussed in circular telegram 1707, April 29, to
                            the Embassies in Paris and Brussels and to representatives in Geneva
                            attending the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations. This
                            lengthy telegram stated, among other things, that “in the past several
                            months considerable public attention has focused on the domestic textile
                            situation, which involves wide range of problems resulting from rapid
                            technological change, consumer preference shifts, and increasing
                            international competition.” It went on to explain that the
                            administration recognized the serious problems facing the U.S. textile
                            industry, but that to impose unilateral import quotas and other controls
                            on foreign companies, advocated by the U.S. textile industry, could lead
                            to “serious economic, political, and even security problems.” Therefore,
                            the preferred policy would promote “bilateral and multilateral
                            international cooperation.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                            protection in agriculture, and 3) lowering barriers to international

                        <p>The President said that he had informed the Prime Minister in his private
                            meeting of his Administration's intention to maintain a liberal trade
                            policy. However, he anticipates a very tough fight on this question,
                            particularly since the interests benefitting from exports are quiet,
                            while the protectionist elements are vocal and the textile industry
                            particularly well-organized. The President said he had pointed out to
                            the Prime Minister that the United States recognizes Japan buys more
                            from us than it sells to the United States, that he is conscious of
                            Japan's need for trade, and that he in particular realizes Japan has
                            suffered from the voluntary quota program on textiles instituted in
                            1957. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> mentioned that he
                            had informed the Prime Minister of our multilateral textile proposals,
                            and the Prime Minister had said that Japan was prepared to cooperate
                            fully with the United States in this endeavor.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister expressed fears that the importing countries would
                            gang up on the exporting countries in the multilateral talks. The
                            President commented that the best protection for the exporting countries
                            would be an effort to provide a mechanism for orderly expansion of their
                                <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0495"/>markets. Under these
                            circumstances, individual countries would not be hurt such as Japan had
                            been by its unilateral restrictions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> mentioned that he had spent that morning with
                            representatives of the importing nations in order to get the agreement
                            of these countries, which have not accepted any substantial amount of
                            textiles from Japan, to increase their imports immediately on a phased
                            basis. We hope to get their initial agreement, as a basis for the Geneva
                            discussion, to the accept-ance on a liberal basis of textile imports.
                            This would provide a larger, rather than smaller, market for Japan. The
                            Prime Minister said the Japanese considered such arrangements
                            favorable.</p>

                                xml:id="d219fn1">June 19.</note> Members of Congress met with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and received their first
                            information on the details of the Under Secretary of State's proposed
                            international negotiations on certain textile products. Our feeling is
                            unanimous that the Under Secretary is proceeding on the basis of an
                            erroneous understanding as to the nature of the industry, and of the
                            gravity of the textile and apparel import problem. It is the considered
                            opinion of all of us in the Senate and House alike that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s program will insure the
                            continued deterioration of the U.S. industry.</p>
                        <p>The State Department's plan has several basic defects which doom it to
                            failure. These are (a) it pertains solely to cotton textiles, and
                            excludes wool, silk, and man-made fiber textiles and apparel; and (b) it
                            is built on the 1960 level of imports, except for a possible 30%
                            rollback for Hong Kong; would increase Japan's exports to the United
                            States, and assure every country an automatic annual increase in export
                            potential of all textiles and apparel to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Your seven-point program for the textile industry, as we understood it
                            here in the Congress, was forthright and included all of the industry's
                                <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0496"/>products. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> has indicated that he considers it
                            impossible to negotiate an international understanding on that basis. In
                            effect, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> has come to the
                            conclusion that he cannot discharge the directive contained in Point 6
                            of your May 2 announcement. We in the Congress prefer your program to
                            the Under Secretary's.</p>
                        <p>Members of Congress in both Houses have followed carefully your public
                            statements concerning your intentions in behalf of the textile industry.
                            We understood you to mean that you were determined to achieve an
                            over-all solution of the industry's problems. In all candor, Mr.
                            President, we must respectfully advise you of our considered opinion
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> has devised a
                            piecemeal and entirely inadequate program which is not in accord with
                            your own pronouncements, and which can succeed only in embarrassing the
                            Administration in its programs relating to trade.</p>
                        <p>If you are convinced, Mr. President, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName>'s program is the only one that can be attempted, it
                            is our advice that it would be better to abandon the effort now. His
                            program leads to no real solution and will only compound the injury
                            which we in the Congress feel must be remedied. We know that this is
                            also your objective.</p>

                        <p>On July 7, 1961, a telegram was transmitted to Under Secretary <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s response to the
                            June 22 Congressional letter to him. The telegram stated that the
                            President's June 30 response was sent to Representative Vinson, Senator
                            Pastore, and all the petitioners, and then quoted the text as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>"Thank you for your letter on textile negotiations now being conducted by
                            State Department. I have noted your concern and that of your colleagues
                            over possibility that State Department's efforts arrange international
                            conference may not fully meet problems of industry.</p>
                        <p>"The import problem, I am sure you will agree, must be considered in
                            context our total interest, both foreign and domestic. It should be <pb
                                n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0497"/>borne in mind that contemplated
                            negotiations are designed as one of series efforts assist textile
                            industry. Our objective is to assist industry overcome all handicaps
                            which it faces.</p>
                        <p>"State Department is being instructed to get best possible relief, not
                            only for cotton but other fibers. I am also asking State Department

                                Senator MUSKIE, disappointed by recent U.S. negotiations to resolve
                                problems in the textile industry, urged <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                    >Ball</persName> to press for a significant roll-back in imports
                                of cotton textiles. MUSKIE believed that “there may not soon be
                                another opportunity comparable to this for securing substantial
                                relief for the domestic textile industry.” (Ibid.)</note> concerning
                            the State Department's efforts to organize a multilateral agreement on
                            textile trade. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> greatly
                            appreciates your understanding of the foreign policy implications of the
                            manner in which the United States decides to handle its problem of
                            low-cost textile imports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and those working with
                            him on the textile problem were much encouraged by the preparatory
                            meeting last week (June 21-23) with representatives of other major
                            textile importing countries. They found that the nations of the European
                            Economic Community recognized that the time has come for them to relax
                            their trade restrictions against imports from low-cost countries. This
                            recognition is a basic prerequisite to our efforts to induce the
                            low-cost countries to exercise some restraint so as to avoid disruption
                            in import markets. There was also a recognition that the advanced
                            nations have a common responsibility for providing growing opportunities
                            for trade by the developing countries in a reasonable and orderly
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the conference, the participants joined in proposing
                            an early meeting of textile importing and exporting countries <pb
                                n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0498"/>directed toward some form of
                            international action which would, in the agreed language of the meeting,
                            (a) “significantly increase access to markets which are at present
                            subject to import restrictions”, (b) “maintain orderly access to markets
                            where restrictions are not at present maintained”, and (c) “secure from
                            exporting countries a measure of restraint in their export policy so as
                            to avoid disruptive effects in import markets”. Although the exact dates
                            are not yet set, we expect the meeting to be convened in the last part
                            of July.</p>
                        <p>The staff which is engaged in preparations for the meeting is reviewing
                            various possible formulas for achieving the orderly development of trade
                            and will examine S. 1735 with interest in this connection.</p>
                        <p>The Department is cognizant of the hardship existing in textile
                            communities in Maine. The situation of such communities is a most
                            important element underlying its efforts to bring about more orderly
                            textile marketing conditions and a measure of restraint on the part of
                            low-cost exporting nations. Either Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> or Mr. Warren Christopher, who has been appointed

                        <p>In accordance with Point 6 of your Textile Program, announced May 2,
                            1961, the Department of State arranged for a conference of principal
                            textile exporting and importing countries to “seek an international
                            understanding which will provide a basis for trade that will avoid undue
                            disruption of established industries”. At a 16-nation meeting, which was
                            called in Geneva by the Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs
                            and Trade, an ad referendum agreement was reached July 21, 1961 on a <pb
                                n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0500"/>short-term multilateral
                            arrangement for the 12-month period beginning October 1, 1961, and on
                            procedures for developing a long-term multilateral arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Under the short-term arrangement, if the United States finds that imports
                            of cotton textiles are disrupting its markets, it may call upon the
                            exporting country or countries concerned to restrain exports of those
                            textiles at specified levels but not lower than those which prevailed
                            during fiscal year 1961. If the requested restraint is not exercised,
                            the United States may decline to accept imports at any higher level. The
                            short-term arrangement also authorized similar action respecting imports
                            of non-cotton textiles which frustrate the arrangement for cotton
                            textiles.</p>
                        <p>The multilateral arrangement specifically authorizes bilateral
                            arrangements on terms other than those in the multilateral
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>With respect to a long-term multilateral arrangement, a Provisional
                            Cotton Textile Committee, composed of representatives of all countries
                            which accept the Geneva Arrangements, is scheduled to meet in October,
                            1961, and, by April 30, 1962, to recommend provisions for a long-term
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>You have legal authority to accept the Geneva Arrangements.</p>

                        <p>1. When the Trade Agreements Act was extended in 1958<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d224fn1">P.L. 686, approved on August 20, 1958; 72 Stat.
                                673.</note> authority was sought to cut tariffs by an additional 20%
                            over a four-year period. This authority was requested primarily in order
                            to enable the United States Government to negotiate reciprocal
                            concessions with the Common Market. This was necessary in order to
                            minimize possible disadvantages to our trade as a result of the internal
                            tariff reductions of the <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0501"/>Common
                            Market which under the Rome Treaty would have amounted to 30% over the
                            same period.</p>
                        <p>2. Under the authority granted by the 1958 extension legislation, the
                            United States initiated a round of tariff negotiations in Geneva.
                            Unfortunately, in the bureaucratic process of developing bargaining
                            offers for these negotiations, the Eisenhower Administration threw away
                            most of its chips. First, it made the decision to restrict the
                            commodities for possible negotiation to a very limited list. This list
                            comprehended only 26.3% of our imports from the countries with which we
                            plan to negotiate. Second, the Tariff Commission further limited the
                            Administration's bargaining authority by setting highly debatable peril
                            points for a large number of commodities. The Tariff Commission's action
                            appears to have been taken without serious regard to economic data.</p>
                        <p>3. As a result of these two bureaucratic actions, the United States
                            Delegation at the Geneva Conference was authorized to offer tariff
                            concessions on only 18% of total US imports from the countries with
                            which we were negotiating. In the case of several countries, the limit
                            of our bargaining authority was reduced to around 1% or less of our
                            imports from these countries.</p>
                        <p>4. Meanwhile, both the Common Market and the United Kingdom had
                            approached the Geneva negotiations in an entirely different spirit. Both
                            the Common Market countries and the United Kingdom had indicated that
                            they were prepared to make 20% across-the-board reductions in their
                            tariffs on industrial items, subject to certain specified
                            exceptions.</p>
                        <p>5. They made it clear that they were prepared to go forward with these
                            reductions (on a most-favored-nation basis) even though the United
                            States did not make reciprocal concessions to the same extent. They
                            recognized that the United States had put up with quantitative
                            limitations on their part during the post-war years of the dollar
                            shortage. They recognized also that the United States was having balance
                            of payments difficulties. Finally, they wished to minimize
                            discrimination against the United States resulting from the
                            establishment of the Common Market and the European Free Trade
                            Association.</p>
                        <p>6. But while adopting this flexible and statesmanlike view, they were
                            reluctant to go forward with their 20% across-the-board offers if there
                            was too great a disparity between their offers and those of the United
                            States. In other words, while they did not insist that the United States
                            reciprocate fully, they did feel that they must obtain at least partial
                            reciprocity in order to withstand their own domestic political
                            pressures.</p>
                        <p>7. Our present dilemma is, therefore, that we have so hamstrung our own
                            negotiators that they do not have the authority to make the concessions
                            needed to satisfy even the modest requirements of reciprocity <pb
                                n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0502"/>which the European nations are
                            expecting. As a result, there is grave danger that both the Common
                            Market and the United Kingdom will withdraw from their initial, generous
                            positions and reduce their offers substantially below the original 20%
                            across-the-board proposals. If this occurs, we shall lose the chance to
                            minimize the discrimination against our producers which the external
                            tariffs of the Common Market will otherwise create.</p>
                        <p>8. I need not emphasize to you the difficulties that this will cause us
                            in working toward an adequate modus vivendi with the Common Market. Nor
                            need I emphasize the advantages that we would gain in the Trade
                            Agreements fight next year if we could show that, by using the authority
                            provided by the 1958 extension legislation, we had succeeded in
                            obtaining a 20% across-the-board reduction in both the Common Market and
                            the United Kingdom industrial tariffs.</p>
                        <p>9. The measure of our difficulty is shown by the fact that the Common
                            Market's offers to the United States in the industrial area alone cover
                            more than $347 million, or 60% of our requests in this area, while our
                            offers to the Common Market countries cover only $153 million, or less
                            than one-fourth of their requests. Much the same situation prevails with
                            the United Kingdom. Annex A provides further details.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d224fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>10. Faced with these disturbing facts, we requested our Delegation to the
                            Geneva Conference to cull the list of peril point items on which
                            concessions had been requested by the Common Market and the United
                            Kingdom and to extract those items that might be included in additional
                            offers at a minimum political risk. This operation has now been
                            completed and our Delegation has produced a list of items with a total
                            trade value of $130 million for the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, as indicated in the attached
                            List I.2</p>
                        <p>11. In view of the gross inadequacy of our present offers and the
                            critical importance of successfully concluding the Geneva negotiations,
                            I strongly recommend that we authorize our negotiators at Geneva to
                            increase the United States offers to cover the additional trade items
                            indicated in List I, even though this involves disregarding peril point
                            findings on these items. Our negotiators would use this authority only
                            to the extent they feel it necessary in order to obtain the kind of
                            concessions from our European friends that we require.</p>
                        <p>12. This action would be clearly within your authority. Under the terms
                            of the law you are not bound by the peril points. The law merely
                            requires that you notify Congress of the items with respect to which
                            peril points have been disregarded. This notification does not have to
                            be <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0503"/>given, moreover, until
                            thirty days after a trade agreement has been concluded. If we proceed
                            with this course your report to the Congress would probably not be
                            required until about the middle of December, since it is presently
                            planned to complete the Geneva negotiations by about the middle of
                            November.</p>
                        <p>13. I recommend one additional measure for increasing our offers to the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the United Kingdom. At my
                            request the United States Delegation had assembled a list of items on
                            which the Tariff Commission found peril points which coincide exactly
                            with existing tariff rates. On these items, as shown in the appended
                            List II,<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">Not printed.</note> the United
                            States would be able to offer tariff bindings at present rates, without
                            breaching peril points and without the necessity of reporting to the
                            Congress. Offers for bindings on these commodities were not originally
                            included in our offer lists, because they were thought to be of little
                            value in obtaining reciprocal concessions. But I now feel that they
                            should be included for whatever benefit they may bring, little as it may
                            be.</p>
                        <p>14. By increasing our offers through the inclusion of all or part of the
                            suggested list of peril point items we should, with good luck, be able
                            to insure not only the 20 percent across-the-board reductions by the
                            Common Market and the United Kingdom but also obtain reductions on
                            certain specific items of special interest to American producers. In
                            this way we could demonstrate to the Congress and the American people
                            that by the extensive use of trade agreement authority we are able to
                            minimize the discrimination resulting from the Common Market. We could
                            then pave the way for future trade agreement authority in new
                            legislation enabling us to bring about the further reductions in the
                            external tariff of the Common Market as the Common Market moves
                            progressively into effect. This is, of course, the fundamental basis
                            upon which next Spring's trade agreement fight must be founded.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi></p>
                        <p>15. I recommend, therefore, that we move promptly to enlarge the
                            bargaining authority of our negotiators. I suggest that you ask
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>, as Chairman of
                            the Trade Policy Committee, to convene a meeting of that Committee as
                            quickly as possible to review the list of items on which it is proposed
                            to make new offers. I suggest also that you make clear to the Trade
                            Policy Committee that they should resolve doubtful cases in favor of
                            granting our negotiators the necessary increased bargaining authority,
                            with the understanding that the negotiators will use that authority only
                            if they deem it necessary in order to achieve the results we need.</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0504"/>
                        <p>I recommend you also make clear that if any items are deleted,
                            substitutions should be made covering a comparable amount of trade.
                            Since there are compelling reasons for concluding the negotiations in
                            Geneva by October 31, I suggest that the Trade Policy Committee be asked
                            to report to you on this matter not later than September 22.</p>

                            between the two Departments with respect to certain modifications of the
                            list, as set forth in a letter which the Secretary of Commerce
                            transmitted to you today.<note n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">Not found.</note>

                            to a condition. On the other hand, three new items have been added to
                            offset the deletions. Trade coverage has been increased by $7.3 million

                        <p>The State Department is separately forwarding its departmental view
                            regarding the escape clause proceedings on carpet. I believe, however,
                            that there are reasons not emphasized in the official Department <pb

                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>As you well know, the two countries that would be affected by a general
                            affirmation of the Tariff Commission's recommendations are Belgium and
                            Japan. In deciding the issue, it is important that the President be
                            aware of the following considerations:</p>
                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p rend="center">CONSIDERATIONS WITH REGARD TO BELGIUM</p>
                        <p>The Belgian Government has made it clear that it would strongly resent
                            the application of the escape clause so as to increase duties on Belgian
                            carpets. The Belgian Ambassador in Washington has made strong
                            representations to this effect. The Belgian position has also been made
                            clear to us in Europe.</p>
                        <p>At the moment our relations with Belgium are already strained, and at a
                            time when we need solid European support for our Berlin policy. Even
                            before the Lumumba fiasco, the Belgians felt—rightly or wrongly—that we
                            had a heavy responsibility for pushing them prematurely out of the
                            Congo. Within the last week Belgian bitterness toward the United States
                            has been intensified by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military
                            action against Katanga, which had long been a rich feudal province of
                            the great Belgian banking and mining interests. While reluctantly
                            accepting Congo independence, the Belgians had hoped to maintain their
                            essential interests in Katanga.</p>
                        <p>Today they see the last vestige of those interests threatened by our
                            vigorous support of the Adoula Government and by our endeavors to bring
                            about a reintegration of Katanga into the Congo through an
                            Adoula-Tshombe settlement that would necessarily mean the elimination of
                            Tshombe's Belgian advisers and officers. When this event comes to
                            pass—and it is settled American policy to hasten the event—the Belgian
                            people will quite likely regard this as a final humiliation brought
                            about as a result of American influence.</p>
                        <p>These are only some of the elements that contribute to Belgian
                            unhappiness with our current activities. As is the case with other small
                            nations, Belgium is feeling left out of the Four-Power Berlin talks.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>, who has
                            been most helpful to us in the past, is very prickly as a result of the
                            Big Four treatment of his talk with Khrushchev.</p>
                        <p>Leaving aside its unhappy consequences for our foreign political
                            interests, a decision to increase tariffs on Belgian carpets would have
                            the following effects on other aspects of our commercial policy:</p>

                        <p>At the last meeting of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Ministers,
                            Belgium blocked a decision that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            should sign the Geneva textile agreement on the ground <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0507"/>that it wanted to await the outcome of
                            the carpet proceeding. We succeeded in having this action reversed, and
                            we understand the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> is to sign the
                            agreement today (Monday). But Ambassador MacArthur in Brussels had to
                            take a strong line at the top level to obtain this reversal.</p>
                        <p>Belgium's reluctant agreement to go along with the one-year textile
                            agreement is, of course, only the first stage of the battle. I had a
                            hard time persuading the Belgian representative to play ball with us
                            during the Geneva conference, and an intransigent Belgium can make it
                            difficult for us to work out a longer-range textile agreement that will
                            meet our interests. Belgium is a member of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> and none of the other members has any real interest in
                            a long-term agreement. If the escape clause proceeding is permitted to
                            operate against Belgian carpets, we can confidently count on Belgium's
                            being in an obstructionist mood.</p>

                        <p>The carpet action may have an effect of even greater importance on the
                            current round of tariff negotiations in Geneva. As you know, we are
                            strenuously working to obtain concessions from the Six regarding their
                            common agriculture policy which will meet the requirements of our own
                            agriculture. When Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1"
                                >Freeman</persName> was in Brussels recently, it was made clear to
                            him that in the event the President approved a tariff increase on
                            Belgian carpets the Belgian Government would drag its feet on agreeing
                            to concessions on the part of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            that would make the common agriculture policy palatable to US interests.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> was told in
                            effect that the Belgians would regard the President's decision on
                            carpets as a test of our commercial liberalism.</p>
                        <p>The proposed increase in carpet duties is relevant to the current tariff
                            negotiations in Geneva for an additional reason. As you know, we are
                            seeking to obtain a 20% reduction in the common external tariff of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> on industrial items. It is for
                            this reason that we have recently obtained authority from the President
                            to disregard “peril points” on a number of items in order to provide our
                            negotiators with more bargaining power.</p>
                        <p>An increase in carpet tariffs would not only invite a reaction from an
                            influential <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> country, which might
                            result in the withdrawal or holding back on the 20% reduction offer, but
                            it would actually operate to reduce our bargaining position. Our carpet
                            concessions cover a trade of some $28 million. If the President
                            increases the tariffs on this trade by adopting the escape clause
                            recommendations of the Tariff Commission, the United States will be
                            required, under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> rules, to give
                            compensation in a corresponding amount. The net effect of this would
                            mean that our offers in the current Geneva negotiations would be reduced
                            by $28 million. This would materially detract from the effect we are
                            hoping to achieve by the “peril point” actions.</p>

                            considerations to the President's attention before a final decision is
                            made on the carpet proceeding:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">A. Effect on Bilateral Textile
                                Agreement with Japan.</hi></p>
                        <p>The coming into effect and operation of the bilateral textile agreement
                            just concluded with Japan are subject to certain specific conditions.
                            One of these conditions is that cotton fabrics from Hong Kong shall be
                            restrained at or about the level of imports into the United States
                            during US fiscal year 1961, and that imports of secondary products such
                            as household made-up goods, apparel and knitted goods shall be reduced
                            to 30% or more below the level of 1960.</p>
                        <p>At the present moment we cannot be at all sure of obtaining a firm
                            agreement with Hong Kong. The most we can do is to try to induce Hong
                            Kong to join the Geneva agreement by threatening action to enforce
                            restrictions unilaterally if Hong Kong refuses to do so. The Hong Kong
                            authorities are sophisticated and they may call our bluff. They know
                            that under existing law our authority to act unilaterally is far from
                            clear. They may or may not be persuaded to accept the Geneva agreement
                            by our assertion that Congress will provide the necessary legal
                            clarification in January—and that in the meantime we are prepared, if
                            necessary, to enforce restrictions anyway.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese are well aware of our dilemma. They have had a legal opinion
                            on Section 204<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">Section 204 of the

                                authorizes the President, as he deems necessary, to negotiate
                                agreements with foreign nations limiting any of their agricultural
                                exports into the United States and limiting U.S. imports of any

                            diplomatically, I think they will accept whatever solution we work out
                            for limiting Hong Kong <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0509"
                            />imports—whether by an agreement or by a promise to enforce
                            restrictions either now or as soon as our authority to do so is cleared
                            up in January.</p>
                        <p>But if we embarrass the Ikeda Government again by an increase in carpet
                            tariffs, it may be difficult to hold Japan to the present bilateral
                            agreement. In these circumstances the Japanese may use our difficulties
                            with Hong Kong as a basis for requesting some further concession under
                            the bilateral agreement.</p>

                        <p>As in the case of Belgium, we shall need Japanese cooperation in working
                            out a long-term textile arrangement. The Japanese are not presently in a
                            cooperative mood. They will be even less so if we now initiate an action
                            for an equalization fee on cotton. (I am suggesting in another
                            memorandum to you that this action be temporarily postponed.) The carpet
                            action would be interpreted in Tokyo as one further evidence of our
                            illiberalism.</p>
                        <p>It would, moreover, appear to the Japanese as quite irrational for us to
                            strain their patience further over only a few million dollars in trade.
                            After all, the Japanese are running a balance of payments deficit with
                            us which will amount this year to about $900 million.</p>

                                Committee Meeting.</hi></p>
                        <p>When Prime Minister Ikeda was here last June the President gave him
                            substantial assurances of our determination to pursue liberal commercial
                            policies toward Japan. The proposal to create a US-Japanese Economic
                            Committee was put forward in our attempt to recognize Japan's importance
                            as a major industrial power and to strengthen our ties with a nation on
                            which we must rely as a major source of strength in Asia. The Committee
                            is having its first meeting, as you know, early in November and we have
                            a vital interest in insuring that it meets in a propitious atmosphere.
                            While there is no intention of discussing the textile problem at the
                            meeting, the harrowing experience of the textile negotiations, which
                            seriously weakened the government's position, will have a definite
                            effect on the climate of the proceedings. A decision to increase tariffs
                            on Japanese carpets—coming just before the meeting—would seriously
                            prejudice its outcome.</p>
                        <p>We would do well to remember that it was only fifteen months ago that
                            Communist-inspired mobs in Tokyo caused the cancellation of President

                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>'s friendliness and

                            repair the damage, and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1"
                                >Reischauer</persName>'s brilliant efforts in Tokyo have contributed
                            to a further improvement in relations. But in the vital area of our
                            commercial relations with Japan, disillusionment is setting in.</p>
                        <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>The Japanese have the impression that we talk a good game but do not play
                            it. I certainly cannot be sanguine about the prospects of improved
                            Japanese-US relations if we take further actions against Japanese
                            imports—particularly at a time when the Japanese Government is being
                            forced to take Draconian measures to deal with an alarming trade
                            imbalance.</p>

                        <p>Both the Belgians and Japanese are aware of the fact that the US carpet
                            industry's difficulties derive not from imports but from the domestic
                            production of machine-tufted rugs. This, as you know, is also the view
                            of the executive agencies of our own Government.</p>
                        <p>Since the carpet industry cannot make a persuasive case for escape clause
                            relief, both the Belgians and Japanese will be inclined to construe an
                            upholding of the Tariff Commission's recommendation as another action
                            directed against them. Under such circumstances we can count on their
                            being extremely skeptical of our protestations of liberal intentions in
                            the future.</p>

                            LEGISLATION</p>
                        <p>The President's authority to enter into trade agreements with other
                            countries for the reciprocal reduction of tariffs and other import
                            restrictions will expire in June 1962. The trade agreements program has
                            always rested on two quite distinct bases: on the need for buttressing
                            our international political and security aims with suitable economic
                            meas-ures; and on the grounds of increasing this country's economic
                            well-being through international trade.</p>

                        <p>The relevance of the trade program to our political and security aims is
                            more direct and immediate than it has ever been in the program's 27-year
                            history. The creation and enlargement of the European Economic Community
                            pose a basic issue: whether the tremendous economic potential of this
                            area will be used in harness with the resources of the United States,
                            Japan and the other free world countries toward common political and
                            security aims; or whether, despite the desires and intentions on both
                            sides of the Atlantic, the newly created preferential trading area will
                            draw the enlarged <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and its overseas
                            associates into a separate political force.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum concentrates upon the trade issue,<note n="1"

                        <p>We propose that the President receive renewed authority over a five-year
                            period to negotiate trade agreements reducing present rates of duty by
                            as much as 50 per cent. The authority should be sufficient to enable a
                            broader type of bargaining with the European Economic Community. It will
                            be necessary to change the peril point procedure. To avoid serious
                            injury to domestic producers, an appropriately revised escape clause
                            should be supplemented with a program of trade adjustment assistance.
                            With these basic modifications, the main outlines of the legislation
                            would go on unchanged. The principle of reciprocity in the negotiation
                            of trade agreements and gradualism in putting reductions into effect
                            would remain. While the general approach would involve broad reductions,
                            the problems of certain groups of producers would receive <pb n="486"
                                xml:id="pg_486" facs="0512"/>special consideration. Domestic
                            industry will continue to have an opportunity to be heard.</p>

                            Authority</hi></p>
                        <p>On its present timetable, the European Economic Community will have
                            eliminated substantially all its tariffs and other import restrictions
                            on trade among its members at an early date, no later than 1969 and
                            probably much sooner. From now on, goods from outside the Community will
                            face a growing measure of discrimination. This will develop even though
                            it is anticipated that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will in
                            the 1961 <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations make a 20
                            per cent reduction in its external tariffs on manufactures without
                            equivalent reciprocal grants by the US. Now the United Kingdom has
                            declared its intention to enter the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            and gain tariff-free access to the markets of the Continent. Probably
                            most of the other members of the <gloss target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss>
                            will eventually join, increasing the effective discrimination against
                            the outside world. The resulting union will have a population 43 per
                            cent greater than that of the US and exports more than twice as large.
                            Last year the US sent one third of her merchandise exports, nearly $6.7
                            billion, including $2.1 billion of agricultural products, to the <gloss
                                target="#t_OEEC1">OEEC</gloss> countries. The external tariff of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> thus affects access to what is
                            potentially the world's largest single market.</p>
                        <p>If we fail to protect our access to Europe's markets, we risk a shrinkage
                            of our favorable merchandise trade balance which was $4.7 billion in
                            1960. Moreover, we would not diminish the incentive to a large flow of
                            US direct investment in Western Europe provided by the existence of a
                            high tariff wall. Both considerations would aggravate our vexing balance
                            of payments problem and propel us toward the last resort of import
                            restrictions, which would induce retaliation and permanently cost us the
                            economic leadership of the free world. If we fail to achieve reciprocal
                            tariff reductions with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, we cast
                            away a powerful tool for restraining inflation and encouraging
                            innovation in the American economy.</p>
                        <p>The timetable of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> is not absolutely
                            fixed, and the evidence is that the process of internal tariff reduction
                            may well be completed in three to four years. The faster the pace of
                            internal reduction, the greater the degree of tariff discrimination. The
                            President's authority to negotiate tariff reductions and the period
                            within which he is authorized to do so should relate to these basic
                            considerations. To insure some time flexibility on the part of the
                            United States the President should have authority to enter into trade
                            agreements over a five-year period although in fact, with the
                            acceleration of the internal tariff reductions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, negotiations may have to be completed
                            within two or three years. To insure a minimum of discrimination against
                            our products, the President must have authorization to reduce all US
                            duty rates by 50 per cent. Even this authority may not be sufficient to
                            achieve a “tolerable” level of discrimination and a larger quantum of
                            authority may be needed. (The authority here <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487"
                                facs="0513"/>recommended is thought to be the maximum politically
                            possible of achievement.)</p>
                        <p>Any negotiation sufficient to accomplish our objectives will probably
                            have to involve commitments on both sides to cut tariffs broadly on
                            large groups of products. As for the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                            >EEC</gloss>, that organization would find it impossible to reach
                            agreement among its six countries on a single list of offers and demands
                            in individual products. On the side of the US, we are pushed toward the
                            same pattern. Our broad objective is to ensure that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> market is available to the export
                            interests not only of this country but also of other nations not in a
                            position to bargain effectively, such as those of Latin America. Even if
                            the interests of domestic exports were our sole concern, it would be
                            hard to pick the products critical to our exporting interests. The
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> offers a new, dynamic
                            opportunity for US exporters, whose full implications will not generally
                            be understood until the US has tested the market.</p>
                        <p>This negotiating authority could provide the vehicle for major
                            enlargements of the market opportunities of the less developed countries
                            in the industrialized areas. The need for this enlargement is critical.
                            Foreign aid is a costly substitute for foreign trade. Furthermore, the
                            development of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> raises the
                            possibility that goods of the associated territories of its members will
                            enter the Community duty-free while competing products of other less
                            developed countries face the external duties of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. The United States should use its trade
                            agreements authority in seeking multilateral agreements among the
                            industrialized countries to promote access for products such as those of
                            tropical agriculture and the growing volume of manufactures likely to
                            come from the developing areas.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Peril Point Provision</hi></p>
                        <p>For the United States to win the necessary general reductions in the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>'s external tariffs, we shall
                            have to agree to equally general cuts. These might involve significant
                            average reductions in large groups of our tariff rates, with some limits
                            on the way in which we (and other nations in the agreement) achieve the
                            average. We must change both the substance of our peril point and the
                            escape clause provisions and the procedure by which we apply them if we
                            are to enter upon this kind of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Under the present procedures and criteria, the peril point findings of
                            the Tariff Commission have ended any hope of further substantial
                            reductions. This blockage grows from procedures and criteria which are
                            basically unreliable and illogical. The Commission must make findings on
                            a great number of products in a relatively short period of time. These
                            findings involve difficult predictions subject to a low degree of
                            accuracy even if the Commission had full information. It must pretend to
                            set the peril points on particular products of integrated industries,
                            independent <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0514"/>of what happens to
                            tariffs on other products. It must estimate the threat of injury to an
                            industry without knowing what new exporting opportunities may be created
                            for that same industry by the international bargain to come. It is
                            natural that, in the absence of a clearly defined tariff reduction goal,
                            the Commission feels free to resolve all areas of ignorance and
                            uncertainty about the effects of imports in favor of a finding that a
                            rate below the existing level may result in injury.</p>
                        <p>In addition, however, the possibility of broad negotiations renders the
                            definition of serious injury which governs peril point and escape clause
                            provisions, inappropriate in any case, especially incongruous. At
                            present, the peril point and the escape clause require the US to take
                            account of the domestic production of every individual product, even if
                            the industry is a multi-product industry. In negotiations of broad
                            scope, however, many US industries can anticipate a broad liberalization
                            in their export opportunities even as they face a like liberalization in
                            import competition; significant shifts in the composition of production,
                            therefore, are bound to occur. Some of these shifts will take place
                            within industries and some across industries. The critical question is
                            and ought to be whether, on balance, US labor and US productive
                            facilities will be or have been idled in the process. The thrust of our
                            proposed amendments would be to find injury only where such idling of
                            labor and facilities occurs and to offer adjustment assistance of
                            various kinds to speed the necessary shift.</p>
                        <p>The following sequence illustrates the negotiating procedures which could
                            be employed under the proposed authority of the President: <list>

                                <item>A proposal would be framed under which the US would agree
                                    tentatively with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, Japan
                                    and other industrial countries to reduce our respective tariff
                                    rates, for instance, by some average percentage. To deal with
                                    some of the “hard core” trade problems of which we are already
                                    aware, we and the other countries would reserve a limited number
                                    of products for special treatment. The average reduction,
                                    according to the agreement, might have to be reached separately
                                    for each of a number of broad categories of products.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Subsequent to the negotiation of this tentative agreement, a
                                    suitable schedule of rate reductions would be fixed tentatively
                                    after hearings, and the Tariff Commission would determine
                                    whether serious injury would ensue for a US industry if these
                                    particular rates were adopted. The criteria of injury applicable
                                    in peril point proceedings would be the redefined criteria of
                                    the escape clause.</item>

                                <item>Peril point findings by the Tariff Commission might indicate
                                    that the tentative weighted average reductions could not be
                                    reached for some groups without threat of injury. These findings
                                    would then be taken into account by (a) reducing these items no
                                    further than was possible under the peril point finding, (b)
                                    reducing the items beyond the peril point with <pb n="489"
                                        xml:id="pg_489" facs="0515"/>or without instituting an
                                    investigation which may lead to a program of adjustment
                                    assistance for the vulnerable portions of the affected industry,
                                    (c) proposing other tariff reductions to the Tariff Commission
                                    for peril point findings to serve as offsets to deleted items,
                                    or (d) renegotiating the targets of the tentative international
                                    agreement to conform with the peril point restraints.</item>

                        <p>This procedure plus the new criteria for injury would greatly improve the
                            peril point process. In the process of fixing a peril point for each
                            individual commodity, the Commission would examine the effect of the
                            whole tentative bargain on each industry or segment of the economy,
                            i.e., the effects of specific proposed reductions on all competing
                            imports and the new opportunities for exports created by the reciprocal
                            concessions of other countries.</p>

                        <p>A new test of serious injury, the idling of an industry's capital and
                            labor directly and substantially due to increased imports, would govern
                            the Tariff Commission's deliberations in escape clause proceedings. The
                            present practices of taking an increase of imports as itself an
                            indication of injury and defining the facilities producing a single
                            product as an industry should be discarded. Neither feature reflects the
                            conditions of true economic injury, nor the way in which American
                            industry typically responds to economic change. However, there should be
                            more remedies available than just tariff increases when the Tariff
                            Commission finds that injury has occurred under this more appropriate
                            standard. The President should be authorized to accept or reject the
                            Commission's recommendations as at present, but he should also be able
                            to invoke adjustment assist-ance for the injured industry, either with
                            or without the temporary relief of import restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Adjustment assistance, administered by the Departments of Commerce and
                            Labor and any other appropriate agencies, should include such types of
                            aid to firms in affected industries as assistance in labor retraining
                            programs, low interest loans for financing new equipment, and special
                            amortization privileges. Workers should be aided through the provision
                            of moving expenses, retraining and extended unemployment benefits and
                            early retirement privileges.</p>
                        <p>The above proposals cover the major ingredients of the recommendations
                            for the trade agreements legislation. Many subsidiary aspects of this
                            legislation have not been covered in this paper. Moreover, it is
                            expected that the proposals with respect to trade agreements legislation
                            will constitute only a part, albeit the most important, of a broader set
                            of policies in the field of trade some of which may require legislative
                            action independent of the trade agreements legislation.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>There are two considerations that we think bear upon the Petersen trade
                            legislation paper.<note n="1" xml:id="d228fn1"><ref target="#d227"
                                    >Document 227</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>First, as a tactical matter, the Petersen proposal suggests that we
                            begin, so to speak, with a minimum position. The theory is that by
                            pre-senting a familiar concept, the peril point, and a well-known
                            framework, the old Trade Agreements Act, we can hope to get a much
                            improved and substantially more workable trade policy law. If enacted,
                            it is argued, the Petersen proposal would give the Executive Branch a
                            considerable range of negotiating authority. Further, its procedures
                            would put the Tariff Commission in a position in which it would be
                            usually awkward and difficult to find that peril points had been
                            reached, since we would already have completed an extensive negotiation
                            with our major trading partners. At worst, the President could always
                            breach peril points if the Tariff Commission acted contrary to this
                            expectation.</p>
                        <p>Even if all this is granted, there is a preliminary question as to
                            whether it is tactically advisable to ask for a small package. Petersen,
                            and I believe Ray Vernon and Stan Metzger, evidently are persuaded that
                            nothing more can be obtained from the Congress and that to ask for more
                            would be to risk an explosion on the Hill that would ruin the prospects
                            for acceptable trade legislation. The other side of the argument, of
                            course, is that by beginning low you insure that Congress will give you
                            the rock bottom minimum. If you offer Congress the peril point and other
                            features of the past, it will be driven to improve on all the
                            protectionist aspects of the legislation and thus to leave us worse off
                            than we are now, if that is possible.</p>
                        <p>The other point is strategic in nature. It is forcefully represented to
                            me by the staff in E that the problem with our present trade agreements
                            law is not only that restrictive features have been added to it over the
                            years but that there has also grown up an environment of hypercaution
                            and negativism about trade policy that is associated with the existing
                                <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0517"/>law. Thus, in preparing for
                            the current Dillon round of negotiations (which had been advertised to
                            the Congress as promising to be the largest and most complex tariff
                            negotiations in our history), the Trade Agreements Committee whittled
                            away at the preliminary negotiating list until it represented only but
                            26 per cent by value of the relevant 1959 imports. The whittling process
                            reflected, in part, the prospect that items would be peril pointed by
                            the Tariff Commission anyway and, in another part, the prevailing and
                            pervasive negativism of the other Departments, built upon ten years of
                            an increasingly protective atmosphere surrounding the trade agreements
                            law. When the Tariff Commission was brought in, the list was further cut
                            to about 18 per cent of our 1959 imports by value, this, of course,
                            directly on the basis of peril points. I am advised that when we have
                            completed these negotiations, which as I say have been represented in
                            hyperbole to the Congress, the net reduction in our tariffs will be in
                            the order of 2 to 3 per cent.</p>
                        <p>With this background, the staff people who have lived with this problem
                            over the years feel very strongly that the time has come for a clean
                            break, that unless we can get a law which in its language and spirit
                            suggests a forward movement, tariff reductions of any significance
                            simply will not be feasible. They argue that retention of the peril
                            point concept in the law implies in a larger sense the retention of the
                            negative bias that has progressively strangled the trade agreements
                            program over the past decade. Thus, the Petersen proposal, even if
                            enacted into law without restrictive amendments, would not give us the
                            basis for a trade program suited to the requirements of 1962 and
                            thereafter.</p>
                        <p>In the E view, therefore, the issue is not merely tactical. Although we
                            feel that it would be dangerous to begin with a proposal designed in
                            part to placate protectionist sentiment, since Congress quite likely
                            would not stop there, we also feel that legislation built around the
                            peril point and serious injury approach would in fact merely perpetuate
                            a situation that has grown up in which a workable trade policy is not
                            practicable of achievement.</p>
                        <p>We would recommend, therefore, that the Department hold out for a strong
                            beginning position: broad tariff reduction authority; no peril point;
                            and adjustment assistance to be the normal response to an injury
                            finding.</p>

                        <p>The alternative which has been suggested is to defer submission of a
                            trade bill for the time being, presumably until the 1963 session of the
                            Congress. There are some persuasive arguments in favor of this view. One
                            is that the full implications of the expanded <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> have not yet sunk in among Americans and that another
                            year would be helpful in rousing them both to the extraordinary
                            challenge and the extraordinary opportunity created by the enlarged
                            Community. A second argument is that the negotiating situation between
                            Britain and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will be much clearer
                            a year hence; and, as a corollary, that it will be much more obvious
                            what statutory powers the United States will need in order to deal with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Still a third argument turns on
                            the asserted risks of submitting legislation of this sort in an election
                            year. If it were decided to postpone, according to the proposal, this
                            would not be done in any casual or laconic way; the President would make
                            a major statement emphasizing the need for closer economic ties with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, observing that this would
                            require a major statutory overhaul, and noting that the time was not yet
                            ripe for deciding exactly what changes would be needed.</p>
                        <p>Despite the persuasiveness of this view, I do not recommend such delay.
                            My reasons are these: <list>
                                <item>First, any delay will be interpreted as a prelude to retreat.
                                    However artfully the President's statement may be, the public
                                    impression will be one of vacillation and uncertainty. Groups in
                                    support of liberal policies in the foreign economic field will
                                    lose heart and momentum; the protectionists will gain in
                                    strength and will use the added year to gain even
                                    further.</item>
                                <item>Second, I see no clear reason to suppose that a year's delay
                                    will make the American public more willing to take a bolder
                                    approach toward ties to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.
                                    True, there may be more heightened interest and education about
                                    the Community a year hence than today. But if the United States
                                    were not already in motion toward closer economic ties, the
                                    interest could easily take a dangerous isolationist and
                                    nationalist form. This is a case in which our tone toward the
                                        <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> has to be set clear and
                                    early, not only by a speech but by action on the part of US
                                    leaderships.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>My third point has to do with the plausibility of the view that we will
                            be in a better position to gauge our negotiating needs a year hence than
                            we are at the present time. This position presupposes that we cannot
                            hold <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0519"/>serious negotiations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> until about June 1963. I
                            question the realism of that view. Already we are being dragged into one
                            aspect or another of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            negotiations, with or without powers of negotiation. We are already deep
                            in negotiations over the treatment of tropical product imports by the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, and, if we were not already in
                            those negotiations, mounting pressure from Latin America would probably
                            push us in very soon. We are already being drawn into discussions of the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> treatment of temperate
                            agricultural items such as wheat and feed grains; once again, we would
                            be forced into these discussions by the mounting fear of some
                            exclusionary deal if we did not move into them of our own accord. As I
                            read the record, therefore, the notion that we can hold aloof from the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> negotiations for another 21
                            months seems grossly unrealistic.</p>
                        <p>As for the election-year versus election-off year timing issue, there is
                            little to be said on this point. All years are bad years for trade
                            legislation. Election years may be worse than off years. On the other
                            hand, the 88th Congress may be poorer in composition than the 87th from
                            the viewpoint of trade legislation. This is an issue on which honest
                            judgments will differ but no judgment can claim much in the way of
                            superiority as a basis of action. The need to maintain the momentum and
                            support of public groups on the side of a liberal trade policy seems
                            more important than the need to avoid an election year.</p>

                        <p>In the attached memorandum<note n="1" xml:id="d230fn1">For text of the
                                enclosed memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                                to President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, October
                                23, see the Supplement.</note> I have set forth a proposal for
                            dealing with the trade agreements problem. This suggests an alternative
                            to the course of action recommended by Mr. Petersen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petersen has sought to design a new trade program within the basic
                            framework of the old reciprocal trade agreement program. I believe that
                            this is the wrong approach. I think that the old trade agreements
                            program was well suited to the conditions of the trading world which has
                                <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0520"/>existed until recently, but
                            in today's world that program is substantially bankrupt. Even if Mr.
                            Petersen's proposals were adopted by the Congress without further
                            watering-down I do not believe they would be good enough.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petersen's proposals are, in my view, too little and too soon. Within
                            the next year the conditions of a whole new trading world will be
                            largely established. A new trading community in Europe, with a larger
                            population and over twice the imports of the United States, will be
                            emerging. The pattern of world trade in such temperate-zone products as
                            wheat, coarse grains, and dairy products will be undergoing radical
                            alterations. The trade arrangements for tropical products such as cocoa,
                            coffee, and oilseeds may be subject to similar far-reaching changes.
                            These developments will unlock new political pressures from various
                            directions—from US exporters, from Latin American countries, from the
                            British Commonwealth, and from the European Economic Community
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>My earnest suggestion—arrived at after considerable soul-searching—is
                            that we announce the general directions of a new policy appropriate to
                            the changed conditions of the trading world, but that we hold off the
                            drafting and introduction of an explicit legislative proposal until
                            1963, which will not be an election year.</p>
                        <p>The principles which the American people must be prepared to accept are
                            these: We shall have to give up the item-by-item tariff negotiating
                            approach of the past and shall have to negotiate for a major
                            across-the-board reduction on our import restrictions and those of the
                            European Economic Community, aimed at opening both economies further to
                            one another's exporters. At the same time, we must find a coordinated
                            way of opening the markets of all industrial nations to the expanding
                            industrial exports of developing countries. We shall have to develop an
                            assistance program for a limited number of domestic industries which may
                            have difficulty in absorbing the adjustment impact. And we shall have to
                            negotiate explicit international trading arrangements in a number of key
                            agricultural products.</p>
                        <p>By next fall, if we use the intervening year wisely the American people
                            should be much better prepared to accept the need for major changes of
                            this sort. They will see and, I hope, begin to understand the shape and
                            implications of the new trading world. We ourselves will have a great
                            deal clearer conception of the exact legislative tools that are needed.
                            Against the background of this understanding we can ask Congress in the
                            Spring of 1963 for the necessary legislation with far greater assurance
                            of success.</p>
                        <p>This course seems to me preferable than to attempt to obtain legislation
                            next Spring that will be inadequate for the problems that will confront
                            us. There is no compelling reason why we should ask for new <pb n="495"
                                xml:id="pg_495" facs="0521"/>legislation immediately on the
                            expiration of the negotiating powers provided under the 1958 extension.
                            Existing agreements will remain in effect even though the authority
                            lapses.</p>
                        <p>There is a further consideration of great importance. If we seek
                            legislation next Spring we shall run grave risks of confusing the
                            Congression-al debate with the sensitive and difficult negotiations in
                            which we shall be engaged in Europe. The negotiations to expand the
                            Common Market to include not only the United Kingdom but other Western
                            European countries will be of major concern to the United States. It is
                            essential that you and the Executive Branch have as much maneuvering
                            room as possible in order to influence those negotiations in a way
                            beneficial to the whole complex of our national interests.</p>
                        <p>But we may seriously compromise that maneuvering room if we must, at the
                            same time, engage in a debate on trade policy. We can count on the
                            protectionists doing everything possible to tie your hands and to try to
                            force the United States to take positions in the European negotiations
                            that run counter to our long-range interests, both political and
                            economic.</p>
                        <p>These are only certain of the considerations that have led me to
                            recommend against an immediate decision to begin the trade fight next
                            Spring. In the attached memorandum I have attempted to argue the case
                            fully as well as to suggest in some detail a course of action that I
                            recommend you follow.<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">Not

                            heavy emphasis on opportunities and problems arising from European
                            Economic Community and prospective British adherence thereto. Japan
                            mentioned only once, in context of Japan's economic weakness during
                            early post-war period. Therefore, Japanese may possibly be disturbed by

                                <item>First excerpt: “In blunt terms, we dare not turn our backs on
                                    the logic of our own economic position. For almost thirty years
                                    we have led the world toward freer trade. If at this late date
                                    we should yield to the importunings of those who would shelter
                                    the low-wage industries in our economy and penalize the most
                                    efficient, let us be quite clear about the consequences. We
                                    would set off a chain reaction of retaliation and
                                    counter-retaliation that would do irreparable harm to the whole
                                    Free World but would hurt us most of all. We would give up any
                                    claim to a role of <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0523"
                                    />leadership in the Free World. We would deny the strength and
                                    vitality of the economic system for which we stand.”</item>
                                <item>Second excerpt: “In concentrating upon the paramount
                                    problem—the problem of the European Common Market—I do not wish
                                    to overlook the fact that our new legislation must also
                                    establish a basis for continuing an open trading world with
                                    other nations. Of course, to the extent that the United States
                                    and the Common Market lower their trade barriers as a result of
                                    the negotiations between them, they will also be expanding the
                                    opportunities of others. For any such reductions in trade
                                    barriers must, of course, be on a nondiscriminatory basis. Yet
                                    authority to negotiate directly with other countries also will
                                    be needed, to increase the mutual opportunities of all nations
                                    and to weld a close-knit trading system in the Free
                                    World.”</item>
                                <item>Third excerpt: “We are engaged at the moment, as all of us are
                                    constantly aware, in a struggle that can determine the future of
                                    mankind—or, indeed, if mankind has any future at all. In that
                                    struggle we must make certain not only that we are economically
                                    and industrially strong, but that the Free World is united as
                                    closely as possible in pursuit of our common purpose.”</item>

                                <p>As seen from Tokyo on basis week's perspective and close study of
                                    outpouring of interviews, articles, and commentaries in Japanese
                                    press, <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0524"/>radio and TV,
                                    Embassy believes Hakone conference should be accounted great
                                    success. In its symbolic purpose Hakone provided dramatic
                                    demonstration to millions of Japanese overriding importance of
                                    U.S.-Japanese relationship. In Hakone's substantive aspects we
                                    believe Japanese Govt derived real sense that, as President and
                                    Ikeda intended, genuine and equal consultations have taken place
                                    on economic matters of mutual concern. We would estimate that
                                    effect of these consultations will prove very helpful to our
                                    interests in fields of Japanese public opinion, in domestic
                                    political situation, and in development of <gloss

                                have continued report on Hakone as matter highest interest in Japan.
                                While some editorial comment has criticized lack of specific
                                results, such as U.S. commitment refrain from protectionist actions
                                limiting Japanese exports to U.S. markets, on whole press has been

                                One of most important effects of Hakone was its significance for
                                future of Ikeda administration. Prior to conference, Ikeda's
                                position was sagging as combination of serious disequilibrium in
                                Japanese payments, apparent upsurge trade protectionism in U.S., and
                                formation regional economic groupings excluding Japan. These
                                developments threatened to undermine twin pillars of Ikeda's policy:
                                partnership with U.S. and program to double national income within

                                    >Rusk</persName>, Ikeda reminded Japanese public that joint

                                >Kennedy</persName>-Ikeda talks last summer and conveyed impression
                                that successful meeting was one of fruits of his U.S.-Japan
                                “partnership” diplomacy. In so doing he limited political mileage
                                Agriculture Min Kono and Trade Min Sato obviously hoped to get from
                                active participation in discussion. At same time he managed preserve
                                party and Cabinet unity to unusual degree in Japan and neither Kono
                                nor Sato espoused different positions from those officially
                                expressed in <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> talking papers.
                                Kono, who seemed resentful and disgruntled at start of conference,
                                was later reported to be thoroughly satisfied with outcome and with
                                his role. On balance it appears to us Ikeda gained most from
                                conference in terms domestic political situation and that whatever
                                subsequent favorable developments on economic scene can be

                                    to refer almost casually to prospective measure of financial
                                    retrenchment and to next year's growth rate as “somewhere”
                                    between three percent and ten percent. Fact that he could do so
                                    with little public outcry and with complete absence factional
                                    sniping inside his own party owes much to Hakone conference.
                                    Hakone may in fact have succeeded in producing indispensable
                                    factor for Ikeda's survival beyond next spring, providing means
                                    to reinforce U.S.-Japan partnership while disengaging Ikeda from
                                    albatross of overly specific national income statistics and from
                                    personal identification with slogan of “9.2 percent annual

                            failure to bring to a conclusion the Geneva tariff negotiations.</p>
                        <p>These problems are of deep concern to the United States. The issues that
                            prevent the satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations seem now to have
                            assumed such a character that they can be resolved only by agreement
                            among responsible ministers. I greatly fear that unless we can reach
                            such an agreement during the early days of next week the situation may
                            get out of hand.</p>

                        <p>I am sure you will agree that it is to our mutual political and economic
                            interests to complete these negotiations at the earliest possible date.
                            On our part, we are presently perfecting plans for the presentation of a
                            new liberal trade program to Congress. Without the assurance of a
                            satisfactory conclusion to the present round of tariff negotiations we
                            can hardly go forward with this initiative.</p>
                        <p>I would hope, therefore, that I might have the opportunity in Geneva of
                            meeting privately with the responsible ministers of the Six member
                            countries <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and a Commissioner of the

                            these negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I am sending this letter to you in advance of the meeting so that, if you
                            share the sense of urgency I have expressed, you might arrange for
                            authority from your own Government to make whatever decisions are
                            necessary for a mutually satisfactory solution to the present
                            stalemate.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Mr.
                            Petersen reported on the discussions in Geneva regarding the tariff
                            negotiations. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> indicated that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> is evidently embarked on a policy of establishing
                            self-sufficiency in agricultural production while liberalizing in the
                            industrial <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0529"/>sector. He noted
                            that the pressures in this direction were increasing and probably
                            resulted from the fact that the industrial sector feels that it can meet
                            foreign competition successfully.</p>
                        <p>He reported that he had taken a hard position in trying to move the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Ministers to be more forthcoming
                            in the Dillon round and the Article 24:6 negotiations but that the
                            Ministers indicated they were powerless to move although personally they
                            were so disposed. As a result of these talks, he doubted that the
                            agricultural package could be improved. He was also concerned that the
                            longer the negotiations continue the greater the danger is that the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will pull back on the offers on
                            the industrial items. This is particularly affected by the fact that as
                            the U.K. gets closer to association with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> the incentive to generalize the U.K.-<gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> concessions will decrease.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested
                            that one possible way of handling the impasse was to seek a rebinding of
                            current concessions and to keep the way open for negotiations after the
                            common agricultural policy is established.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> indicated that
                            he was concerned that if we concluded the current negotiations we would
                            be giving away our bargaining position in trying to get a better bargain
                            on agricultural items in the post <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss>
                            period. He suggested that the President is the only one who can decide
                            on whether or not we should conclude the negotiations on the present
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Petersen pointed out that if the negotiations are not concluded when
                            the new trade legislation is sent up to the Hill, Congress could refuse
                            to give any further authority since it could say that we were not
                            successful in using the current authority with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested two
                            possibilities as a way out of the current impasse: one would be to seek
                            a slight improvement in the agricultural package and sign it pretty much
                            as it is, or, secondly, to have Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1"
                                >Freeman</persName> and Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> go to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            Ministerial Meeting in Brussels on December 4 and 5 and try to push the

                            acceptable agricultural component of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, a meeting was set up for Secretary <persName

                            Japanese cotton textile exports to US were $71 million in 1960, Japan
                            bought $251 million of raw cotton from US in 1960-61 crop year. Should
                            equalization fee be imposed, he maintained, it would do irreparable
                            damage to Japanese cotton textile exports to US. At one point he said if
                            fee imposed, bilateral textile agreement would be dead and it would be
                            too late for further cooperative efforts regarding world cotton textile
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Takeuchi stressed following points which also developed in talking

                                fully safeguarded by such arrangements. Equalization fee would
                                subject Japanese exports to double restriction which clearly
                                inconsistent with Geneva cooperative spirit.</item>

                                imports. Therefore, US should not argue that cotton textile imports
                                adversely affect US cotton price support program or export
                                program.</item>

                                Moreover, percentage US grown cotton in textiles exported from Japan
                                to US has been as low as 21 percent. Unreasonable that equalization
                                fee be imposed on textiles manufactured from raw cotton grown other

                        <p>On December 7, 1961, the Department of State, reacting to the Japanese
                            Government's protest of the President's November 21 request for a Tariff
                            Commission investigation on the establishment of an equalization fee on
                            cotton textiles from Japan, sent telegram 1465 to the Embassy in Tokyo.
                            This telegram, serving as guidance, outlined several points with which
                            to respond to the protest, and is scheduled for publication in <ref

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Orville</hi>: As you know, a week ago I brought
                            our experts back from Geneva and Brussels to make a complete review of
                            the tariff negotiations. They have restudied the entire problem as
                            carefully—and, I hope, as objectively—as possible and have prepared the
                            attached memorandum.<note n="1" xml:id="d237fn1">This memorandum has not
                                been found. <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> discussed the

                                negotiations were vital to carrying out President <persName

                                another telephone conversation, October 2, <persName

                                concluding the tariff negotiations quickly in order to avoid the
                                possibility of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> seeking U.S.
                                concessions. (Memorandum of telephone conversation; Department of
                                State, Central Files, 394.41/10-261)</note></p>
                        <p>This memorandum shows conclusively, I believe, that we have no practical
                            alternative but to close the negotiations substantially on the basis of
                            the last package offer from the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. If
                            we do not do so promptly—and the 111 Committee meets toward the end of
                            this week—I think we must surely anticipate that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> will withdraw its offers and the whole
                            negotiation will collapse. Without overstating the consequence of such
                            an event I think it could very well mean the destruction of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> and a return to anarchy in our
                            international commercial relations.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0533"/>
                        <p>The memorandum I have sent to you makes clear that the overall results of
                            the negotiations, if we were now to accept the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> offer, would be highly advantageous for the United
                            States. Except for the 30 percent of agricultural trade covered by the
                            Common Agricultural Policy, the results are not disadvantageous even
                            with respect to agriculture. As to that 30 percent, I am convinced that
                            the best we can do is to try to preserve our rights and obtain the
                            agreement of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> nations to
                            negotiate regarding these products when they have reached a larger
                            measure of agreement among themselves regarding their Common
                            Agricultural Policy.</p>
                        <p>Concretely I would propose the following course of action:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Go back to Geneva with a request that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                    >EEC</gloss> obligate itself to negotiate with respect to rice
                                after the Common Agricultural Policy is decided upon, as it has
                                offered to do with respect to corn, sorghum and poultry.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Seek joint approval of a declaration along the lines of the one
                                attached, recognizing the special circumstances of the 1960-1961
                                negotiations and looking forward to new negotiations when the <gloss
                                    target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> has worked out its Common
                                Agricultural Policy.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Upon receiving agreement regarding these two points, accept the
                                    <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> package.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I am convinced that this program is the best course for us to follow
                            under all the circumstances. We have carefully considered the
                            possibility of trying to mobilize support from other countries and we
                            have concluded that nothing would be gained by such an effort. Certainly
                            the United Kingdom would not join with us in trying to exact a better
                            deal from the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> at a time when it is
                            desperately trying to negotiate entrance into the Common Market. On the
                            contrary, it would simply withdraw its industrial and agricultural
                            offers from us (which on the whole we consider quite advantageous) and
                            would then make its own deal within the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> and avoid generalizing the benefits under the
                            most-favored-nation principle. The same is undoubtedly true of the other
                                <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries.</p>
                        <p>If one eliminates the <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries
                            there are no trading nations left that have any effective bargaining
                            power with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Canada, Argentina,
                            etc., are trying to ride on our coat tails rather than the other way
                            around.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I think there is any chance at all that we could obtain any firmer
                            commitments to assured access to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            market for the products that are to be covered by the Common
                            Agricultural Policy. The <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> is having
                            an enormously difficult time arriving at a Common Agricultural Policy
                            and the member nations are simply not going to complicate their lives by
                            postponing the effective operation of the policy through offering us
                            assured access over even a limited period of time.</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>These represent the conclusions we have come to after the most sober and
                            careful review of the situation with our experts who have been on the
                            firing line conducting the negotiations and who are most familiar with
                            the views of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and its member
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>I would not think, however, that the long-range result would necessarily
                            be unfavorable even for our trade in those commodities to be covered by
                            the Common Agricultural Policy. We would certainly pursue negotiations
                            with the Europeans vigorously and persistently, after they arrive at a
                            measure of agreement regarding the form and operation of the Common
                            Agricultural Policy. I would hope also that we would be able to obtain
                            sufficient new powers through the new trade legislations to give us the
                            ability to make better industrial concessions in order to obtain
                            concessions on the agricultural side.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that you face a difficult problem in attempting to explain
                            the closing of the negotiations to American agricultural interests. I do
                            not believe, however, that the problem is an insuperable one. I had a
                            discussion the other day with Mr. Herschel Newsom and Mr. Joseph Parker
                            of the Grange. After reviewing the situation with them, I found them
                            quite understanding of our predicament. I should be very glad to see any
                            representatives of farmers' groups that you might suggest.</p>
                        <p>Nor do I believe that the political consequences are likely to be too
                            serious for our trade bill. We could certainly make a very good showing
                            on the industrial side. Even in the case of those Congressmen primarily
                            interested in tobacco and Common Agricultural Policy products a careful
                            explanation, coupled with a promise to pursue a vigorous negotiation at
                            an appropriate later date, should in many cases be effective.</p>
                        <p>I am sending copies of our memorandum to the other interested
                            Departments. I spoke with Doug Dillon before he left for Europe and he
                            expressed complete sympathy with the point of view I have outlined in
                            this letter and strongly endorsed the need for an immediate closing on
                            the basis of the offers we have received. Against the background of his
                            long experience, not only with the current negotiation but with events
                            preceding it and with the structure of the Common Market itself, he was
                            quite categorical in stating that in his view the European nations would
                            not—and indeed could not—negotiate at this time for maximum variable
                            levies for <gloss target="#t_CAP1">CAP</gloss> items nor would they be
                            prepared to give us any assured access to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> market for such items for even as much as a year.</p>
                        <p>I understand that he passed these views on to the President.</p>
                        <p>I am advised that the Department of Commerce also joins in the views
                            expressed in the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>I am looking forward to our discussion this afternoon in the hope that we
                            can bring this matter to a resolution. I would hope that we could arrive
                            at an understanding between us, but if not I believe it essential that
                                <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0535"/>we discuss it with the
                            President tomorrow. We must get some word to the 111 Committee when they
                            meet later this week or I think we shall be in very bad shape. As you
                            know, the Council of Ministers is meeting on December 22 and this seems
                            to me to be our last clear chance to dispose of this long and painful
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The President is intending, I believe, to outline his new trade program
                            in the State of the Union message. I am sure he will be reluctant to do
                            so unless the Geneva negotiation has been closed out first.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador called at his request. He referred to the current Tariff
                            Commission investigation of the possible imposition of an equalization
                            fee on the raw cotton content of cotton textile imports under Section 22
                            of the Agricultural Adjustment Act.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the President's request for such an
                            investigation was embarrassing to the Japanese Government, following so
                            soon after the Hakone meeting of the Joint U.S.-Japan Committee on Trade
                            and Economic Affairs. He said that if the fee were imposed (as feared by
                            the Japanese in view of the President's subsequent statement to the
                            press), it would be tantamount to an increase of 10 to 30 percent in ad
                            valorem duty on Japanese cotton textile exports to the United States. In
                            light of the understandings between the two countries, discussions
                            regarding compensation (or remedial action) would be called for should
                            the fee be imposed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed the strong view that discussions of such
                            compensation would be undesirable. He hoped to avoid possible
                            acrimonious discussions of this kind, saying that textile discussions
                            once a year were enough. In his view it would be difficult to agree on
                            compensation which would be equitable for both the United States and
                            Japan. He urged that, instead of negotiating such compensation, the
                            Japanese industry be permitted to enjoy the level of export to the
                            United States of the past five years (about $70 million). He emphasized
                            that the level should not be decreased. He said that in his judgment the
                            United States could find a way to make an adjustment of the raw cotton
                            price differential without assessing this “tax at the time of
                            importation,” and could permit Japan to enjoy the level of trade of the
                            past five years without asking it to try to reduce textile exports. He
                            pointed out that the Japanese Government had requested a small increase
                            in exports to the United States. He was urging that the level remain the
                            same and not be cut back, and that, at the same time, the United States
                            not impose the equalization fee.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the foregoing represented his personal views and that
                            he was recommending this position to his government. He asked that
                            careful consideration be given to these points.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary responded that we had already instructed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> to indicate to the
                            Japanese Government that this was not a decision. The President had
                            instructed the Department of Agriculture to explore means of taking care
                            of the raw cotton price differential. From the viewpoint of the industry
                            the maintenance of the two-price system, causing high textile prices,
                            would not be healthy. The Tariff Commission has been asked to study the
                            situation; Agriculture is also studying it.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary expressed regret that this had not been explained in
                            advance. An unfortunate impression had been created in Japan. The Under
                            Secretary expressed the hope that a satisfactory way <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0538"/>could be found to take care of the
                            inequities suffered by the domestic industry without the imposition of
                            the equalization fee.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador complimented the Under Secretary on his statement of
                            December 12 before the Joint Economic Committee regarding the Common
                                Market.<note n="1" xml:id="d239fn1">Not found.</note> He said the
                            Japanese had had the impression that the Common Market was disturbing to
                            the United States and had had misgivings that the United States, in
                            order to appease protectionists, might introduce measures against
                            certain third markets which might be disadvantageous to Japan.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary responded that the United States is committed to a
                            policy of non-discrimination.</p>

                                    watershed in U.S. foreign economic policy. It is most important
                                    development in U.S. trade policy since 1934 and makes marked
                                    advance beyond present trade agreements program. It complements
                                    new look in foreign aid policy and is intended give U.S. the
                                    means to take fullest part in building economically strong and
                                    progressive free world.</p>
                                <p>If Congress provides President with legislation requested, result

                                    Legislation placed before Congress would give President

                                    open prospect for mutual reduction and even elimination tariffs
                                    between two largest economic units in world, U.S. and European
                                    Common Market; it would generalize tariff concessions
                                    multilaterally and would progressively widen trade opportunities
                                    for less developed countries. Forthcoming great national debate
                                    on trade issue will present to American people, as never before,
                                    stake they have in international trade. It will thus develop

                                    techniques for some type across-board tariff reductions. We
                                    would not expect new tariff negotiations themselves begin until

                                us are not frustrated by quotas or other restrictive devices. In
                                acting upon President's proposals Congress will undoubtedly register

                                Accordingly other countries should clearly understand that extent to

                            trying to placate various domestic interests.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that the Hakone meeting took place just two months after
                            a long drawn-out and bitter negotiation for a temporary cotton textile
                            agreement. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>
                            reported at the time that the atmosphere in which that agreement was
                            negotiated weakened the position of Prime Minister Ikeda personally and
                            undermined the strength of his Government.</p>
                        <p>The Hakone meeting apparently had the effect of eliminating most of the
                            ill feeling. It also gave Mr. Ikeda a substantial boost.</p>
                        <p>Unhappily, a series of events following that meeting have led some of the
                            Japanese newspapers to question whether anything like a “Hakone spirit”
                            ever really existed. These events include the following: <list>

                                <item>At the instance of the Administration, the Tariff Commission
                                    has undertaken an investigation which may lead to a
                                    recommendation for an equalization fee for cotton textile
                                    imports. This would add what would amount to an additional
                                    tariff on cotton textile imports computed on the basis of 8-1/2¢
                                    a pound of raw cotton content. Japanese textile imports into the
                                    United States are presently frozen at a level below that of 1960
                                    by the existing bilateral agreement. The Japanese estimate—I do
                                    not know how accurately—that the equalization fee would reduce
                                    imports 50 percent. The news of this investigation has blown up
                                    a considerable storm in Japan and has proved again a
                                    considerable embarrassment to the Ikeda Government.</item>

                                    which dealt only with the Japanese refinery concerned. It again
                                    produced additional resentment.</item>

                                <item>The Ikeda Government will shortly have to face up to
                                    introducing into the Diet the agreement for the settlement of
                                    the GARIOA account amounting to $490 million. This is a highly
                                    unpopular action and will undoubtedly create a good deal of
                                    unpleasant debate.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The cumulative effect of these actions is accentuated by the exist-ence
                            of a serious Japanese balance of payments problem which has necessitated
                            substantial domestic retrenchment and deflation. The bilateral trade
                            account between Japan and the United States was unfavorable to Japan
                            last year in the amount of about $700 million and Japan's global balance
                            of payments deficit amounted to $650 million.</p>
                        <p>The present situation is sufficiently serious to be a cause for concern.
                            However, we are about to make it considerably worse by two escape clause
                            actions that are expected to be announced some time this month. In spite
                            of opposition from the State and other Departments, the decision has
                            been made by the President to grant tariff increases under escape
                            clauses on two products of which Japan is a major exporter: Wilton rugs
                            and carpets and sheet glass.</p>
                        <p>Japanese Wilton rug imports into the United States amounted last year to
                            $8.4 million. The Japanese Wilton rug industry is concentrated almost
                            entirely in the already seething Osaka textile area, which has been
                            seriously inflamed by the bitter negotiations that preceded the
                            short-term textile agreement. Sheet glass is also a major item of trade.
                            Imports of Japanese sheet glass into the United States amounted last
                            year to $4,250,000.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Government has made repeated representations to us with
                            regard to both of these escape clause actions, as has the Belgian
                            Government, which is also affected by both of them.</p>
                        <p>The heckling that the Attorney General received at the hands of students
                            a day or two ago is symptomatic of the instability of Japanese
                                opinion.<note n="1" xml:id="d241fn1">Attorney General Robert F.

                            escape clause actions a further frustration of the prospects of
                            “economic cooperation” evoked by Hakone. They can hardly overlook the
                            fact that practically every decision affecting Japanese trade that we
                            have taken since then has been adverse to their interests.</p>

                        <p>I am sorry to have to bother you with this matter, but I have been unable
                            to persuade the President that we should not grant the Wilton carpet and
                            sheet glass escape clauses. I have heard rumors that the carpet industry
                            may have been given the impression some time ago that they would receive
                            the relief they requested. Sheet glass, unfortunately, is principally
                            produced in West Virginia. The President has a special interest in
                            alleviating the depressed conditions in that state, in view of his
                            firsthand experience there during the primary campaign.</p>
                        <p>Quite understandably the President is anxious to demonstrate that escape
                            clauses are not wholly meaningless in order to encourage support for the
                            trade bill. There are at the moment two other escape clauses pending.
                            These cases concern mosaic tile and baseball gloves. They also affect
                            Japan, although their impact would be relatively slight. However, there
                            is little domestic mileage in either of them, and a tentative decision
                            has been taken to reject the escape clause actions in those two
                            cases.</p>
                        <p>At the moment we are attempting to negotiate a long-term textile
                            agreement in Geneva. The Japanese have made a proposal that, we are
                            hoping, may form the basis for a definitive agreement. However, the
                            Japanese insist that final acceptance be held up until they see whether
                            we are going through with the equalization fee on cotton textiles. At
                            some point, we shall certainly have to yield on the equalization fee if
                            we are to get the textile agreement concluded. How seriously the
                            granting of escape clauses on Wilton carpets might affect the ultimate
                            conclusion of a textile agreement, I cannot say. Both Wilton carpets and
                            textiles involve Osaka interests which are politically powerful.</p>
                        <p>I have written this memorandum both to inform you and with the thought
                            that you may wish to discuss this whole question with the President.
                            Perhaps it would be wise to wait until after the Attorney General
                            returns, since he will undoubtedly have been made aware of the Japanese
                            sensitivity at repeated evidences of apparent American protectionism. I
                            talked with him about the problem before he left and told him that I
                            would make sure that the prospective escape clause actions were not
                            taken while he was still in Japan.</p>
                        <p>My own ability to influence the decision on these matters has been
                            impaired by the fact that I have of necessity felt compelled to oppose
                            all escape clause actions, since I have not seen one yet in which an
                            adequate economic case had been made for the claims presented. This
                            consistent opposition has, I am afraid, given my position an appearance
                            of pig-headedness and negativism.</p>

                        <p>On February 16, 1962, the White House released the text of the long-term
                            cotton textile arrangement agreed upon by the Cotton Textile Committee
                            of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade held in Geneva January
                            29-February 9.</p>
                        <p>Valid for 5 years beginning October 1, the arrangement was similar to an
                            earlier one in effect from October 1, 1961, to October 2, 1962, which
                            “enabled importing countries threatened by or subject to market
                            disruption in any of 64 categories of cotton textiles to restrain
                            imports to the level of fiscal year 1961.”</p>
                        <p>This new arrangement, however, allowed any importing nation threatened by
                            or subject to market disruptions to “freeze imports for 1 year to the
                            level of the first 12 of the preceding 15 months.” The freeze could be
                            extended for another year if market conditions persisted but a maximum 5
                            percent increase per year was the limit. For full text of the White

                        <p>The Interdepartmental Committee on Trade Agreements herewith recommends
                            that the President approve the results of United States negotiations
                            thus far concluded in the 1960-61 Tariff Conference, held in Geneva
                            under the sponsorship of the Contracting Parties to the General
                            Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (<gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                            >GATT</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>Because of the scope of the negotiations and the complexity of some of
                            them, the conference was held in two separate phases. The first, which
                                <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0548"/>commenced on September 1,
                            1960, was concerned primarily with negotiations held under Article
                            XXIV:6 of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> with the European
                            Economic Community (<gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>) for a new
                            single schedule of tariff concessions in the General Agreement to
                            replace the previously existing separate schedules of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Member States: the Benelux countries
                            (Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands), France, the Federal Republic
                            of Germany and Italy.</p>
                        <p>The second phase, which began on May 29, 1961, was concerned with the
                            reciprocal exchange of new concessions among interested contracting
                            parties, and with the accession of new contracting parties.</p>
                        <p>Concurrently with the major negotiations in both phases, there were a
                            number of renegotiations pursuant to Article XXVIII and certain other
                            provisions of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. In these
                            negotiations the United States obtained compensatory concessions for
                            changes that several other countries had made in previously granted
                            concessions. On its side, in turn, the United States paid compensation
                            for certain changes which it had made since the last tariff negotiations
                            in 1956.</p>
                        <p>In the first phase, United States negotiators dealt with tariffs
                            involving nearly $2 billion of United States exports. In the second,
                            they dealt with export-import trade of some $2.2 billion. (Annex 1<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d244fn1">None of the annexes is printed.</note>
                            contains a more detailed breakdown of the trade involved.)</p>
                        <p>Pending completion of other countries' negotiations among themselves, the
                            United States proposes to enter into formal bilateral agreements with
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the United Kingdom, and such
                            other countries as are prepared to do so promptly in order that the
                            larger part of the results of negotiations may be made public in the
                            United States. When all negotiations are concluded, the results,
                            including those bilateral agreements of the United States that are now
                            to be proclaimed and made public, will be incorporated into a
                            multilateral <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> protocol. This will
                            include the consolidated schedules of tariff concessions of the
                            individual countries.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">XXIV:6 Negotiation</hi></p>
                        <p>The major negotiation of the first phase was that with the Commission of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> arising in connection with the
                            establishment of the common external tariff of the Common Market. This
                            negotiation was a complex one, involving as it did the replacement of
                            four separate and widely-differing tariff schedules by one new schedule.
                            According to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> provisions, this
                            single schedule is to maintain the general level of concessions provided
                            for in the composite prior schedules of the Member States, and the
                            purpose of the negotiation was to assure that this obligation was
                            complied with.</p>
                        <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0549"/>
                        <p>The United States had a large stake in this negotiation. Approximately
                            $1,028 million of United States trade entered the Community in 1958
                            under tariff classifications on which the rate commitment had been
                            negotiated in past years with the United States by Member States, plus
                            an additional $611 million under commitments negotiated by them with
                            other countries. These figures are exclusive of United States trade in
                            products within the domain of the European Coal and Steel Community
                            (ECSC) and the EURATOM.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty encountered by the United States and other major exporters
                            of agricultural products in finding a basis for dealing with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>'s projected Common Agricultural Policy,
                            coupled with the unprecedented and complex nature of the negotiations,
                            led to slow negotiations which were settled finally only at the time
                            agreement was reached in the reciprocal negotiations and with the
                            intervention of the special representative of the President, Mr.
                            Petersen.</p>
                        <p>The result of the XXIV:6 negotiation is three-fold: First, for the bulk
                            of United States trade, the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> granted
                            concessions on trade of $1,677 million in the base year, or on more than
                            60 percent of its imports from the United States. Of this, $1,583
                            million is in the form of direct bindings to the United States,
                            representing a 60 percent increase in the trade covered by direct
                            bindings. Further, there was also an improvement in the average rate
                            level; increases in previously bound rates affecting $300 million were
                            offset by new bindings at lowered rates affecting $530 million.</p>
                        <p>Second, for products on which the CXT rate of duty has not yet been
                            determined, principally manufactured tobacco products and refined
                            petroleum products, accounting for about 3 percent of United States
                            exports, it was agreed that existing national tariffs would be
                            maintained until such time as the CXT rate is determined, when it would
                            be examined under the usual Article XXVIII procedures.</p>
                        <p>Third, for products to be put under the variable import fee system of the
                            Common Agricultural Policy, agreement was reached on formulae postponing
                            the final negotiation on them and providing certain interim safeguards.
                            This agreement covers wheat, corn, rice, grain sorghum, and poultry,
                            accounting for about 10 percent of our total exports to the Community
                            area. In addition the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> subscribed to
                            a Joint Declaration envisaging renewed negotiation in future for more
                            satisfactory rates on various products, notably tobacco, vegetable oils
                            and chemicals.</p>
                        <p>The remaining 15 percent of United States exports not dealt with is
                            accounted for almost entirely by products under the jurisdiction of the
                            European Coal and Steel Community.</p>
                        <p>A more detailed explanation of the Article XXIV:6 exercise is contained
                            in Annex 2 which has attached to it the agreements reached in the

                        <p>In the reciprocal phase (or so-called “Dillon Round”) for the exchange of
                            new concessions, which commenced on May 29, United States negotiators
                            reached satisfactory agreements with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> and the following 16 countries: Austria, Cambodia,
                            Canada, Denmark, Finland, Haiti, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand,
                            Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
                            Of these, Cambodia, Israel and Portugal are newly acceding countries.
                            Negotiations are still under way with Spain, which also expects to
                            accede. The only other outstanding negotiation is with Sweden, and this
                            appears to be nearing conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Details on the results of these negotiations are included in Annex 3.
                            Annex 3(a) contains a country-by-country description of the agreements
                            reached. The bilateral lists of the concessions obtained by the United
                            States are attached as Annex 3(b). The lists of the concessions granted
                            by the United States are attached as Annex 3(c). In the final protocols
                            these concessions will be combined.</p>
                        <p>In reciprocal negotiations with all countries, the United States obtained
                            direct concessions covering trade amounting to $1,206 million. The
                            figures used in each instance are for the latest year for which import
                            statistics were available as of the time of negotiations with the
                            country concerned, usually 1959 or 1960. Annex 1 shows in tabular form
                            the trade coverage of concessions obtained from each country. In
                            addition to these direct concessions, the United States trade will
                            benefit, to an as yet undetermined extent, from concessions which other
                            countries are granting each other.</p>
                        <p>In exchange, the United States granted concessions covering base year
                            imports of $1,003 million from the countries with which the concession
                            was directly negotiated. United States concessions in the reciprocal
                            phase covered $1,725 million in terms of imports from all sources in
                            1960. United States imports of the products on which concessions were
                            granted are shown in Annex 1.</p>
                        <p>Participation of the less-developed countries in the reciprocal phase was
                            limited. In its negotiations, both in this phase and in the
                            renegotiations undertaken by many of the less developed countries, the
                            United States made a gesture in taking into account their needs by
                            accepting agreements balanced in their favor in terms of strict trade
                            coverage. It was unable within the framework of policy laid down under
                            existing legislation, however, to accede to their wishes for completely
                            unreciprocated concessions.</p>
                        <p>The most significant of the reciprocal negotiations was that with the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. The United States made direct
                            concessions to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> covering imports
                            of $597.4 million which represented 59 percent of those granted by the
                            United States. In exchange, the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> made
                            direct concessions to the <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0551"
                            />United States covering imports of $750.2 million or more than 62
                            percent, in terms of trade coverage, of the concessions obtained by the
                            United States in the second phase of the conference. <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> statistics subsequent to 1958 are not
                            available. However, by projection from United States export figures, the
                            1960 value of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> concessions is
                            estimated at about $1 billion, as against a 1960 value of $795 million
                            for the United States concession.</p>

                        <p>Negotiations with the United Kingdom were second only to the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and accounted for 17 percent of the

                            concessions granted by it.</p>
                        <p>As the result of an unusually cautious approach to the selection of
                            offers taken by the United States Government during the 1960 preparatory
                            period, and of an unprecedented and economically questionable number of
                            “peril point” determinations by the Tariff Commission, United States
                            offers were limited in scope and of generally poor quality because of
                            the exclusion of many key products. This, coupled with the 20 percent
                            reduction limitation of the trade agreements legislation, led to
                            individual offer lists which in many cases lacked appeal to the other
                            countries negotiating. Partly because of this, the majority of the
                            individual negotiations were small.</p>
                        <p>Early in the negotiations it became apparent that these limited offers
                            would not enable the United States Delegation to obtain the concessions
                            it had hoped for on the basis of the linear offers both the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> had indicated a willingness to make. In an effort to
                            improve the negotiating situation, especially with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, the Department of State requested
                            Presidential authorization to make additional offers by breaching
                            peril-point determinations of the Tariff Commission on products dutiable
                            under 27 tariff paragraphs. Such authorization was communicated to the
                            Delegation on September 25, 1961. The additional authority covered
                            imports amounting to $164 million in 1958, of which slightly more than
                            half was for offer to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Of this
                            United States negotiators used $76 million as direct concessions to the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and $7 million to the United
                            Kingdom, with total trade affected amounting to $152 million. A list of
                                <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0552"/>the products on which
                            peril-point determinations were exceeded is contained in Annex 4.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there were several products on which the Tariff Commission
                            found as “peril-points” rates of duty higher than existing rates. Under
                            the trade agreements legislation the Tariff Commission automatically
                            initiates escape-clause investigations. In view of this, and in
                            accord-ance with earlier experience, no attempt was made to negotiate
                            the increased rates. Annex 5, attached, contains a list of the products
                            involved, and an explanation of their current status.</p>
                        <p>Under the trade agreements legislation, the President is required to
                            report to the Congress on each case in which a concession exceeds the
                            “peril points” found by the Tariff Commission or in which he fails to
                            negotiate the higher rates when “peril points” are found above the
                            existing rates. The statute requires that the President send to the
                            Congress a copy of the agreement in each case in which the finding of
                            the Tariff Commission is not followed, together with reasons for the
                            action. A separate draft communication to the Congress is being
                            submitted to the President for this purpose. It will show the
                            President's action to have been fruitful and eminently justified.</p>
                        <p>As part of the reciprocal negotiations, the United States proposed to
                            Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Canada and the United
                            Kingdom that pre-<gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> bilateral
                            agreements, in suspense since 1947, be altogether terminated. This
                            proposal was generally acceptable to the delegations of the several
                            countries but the matter had to be referred to capitals. Canada, the
                            only Government replying thus far, does not wish to take the suggested
                            action. Presidential authorization for the termination of these
                            bilateral agreements, on the part of the United States, is hereby
                            requested against such time as decisions are reached by the other
                            governments to which the proposal was made.</p>
                        <p>In the negotiations, it was found desirable for technical reasons to
                            offer a rate of duty of 9 percent for one item on which Presidential
                            authority to offer 9.2 percent had been obtained. This situation is
                            explained in Annex 6, as is a correction of a typographical error.</p>
                        <p>A number of concessions which had been authorized for offer were not
                            made. These items, covering total imports of $815.8 million, were not
                            used in the negotiation either because countries for which they had been
                            earmarked were not ready to negotiate, or else were not prepared to make
                            counter-offers sufficiently large to warrant their use. A summary of
                            these unusual [unused] offers is attached as Annex 7.</p>

                            countries concerning their claims for compensatory concessions for
                            actions taken by the United States Government since 1956 that had <pb

                            United Kingdom and Italy. A recapitulation of the claims made and
                            agreements reached is included in Annex 8(a).</p>

                        <p>The United States negotiations on changes being made by other countries
                            in previous concessions involved 14 countries: Australia, Brazil,
                            Canada, Ceylon, Finland, Haiti, Indonesia, Japan, Netherlands Antilles,
                            Pakistan, Peru, South Africa, Sweden and Turkey. These renegotiations
                            ranged from small ones involving one to four items to entire tariff
                            schedules covering a total of several hundred tariff items. United
                            States trade involved in the individual negotiations ranged from less
                            than $100,000 to more than a $100 million and totalled about $220
                            million. The United States obtained compensatory concessions in exchange
                            totalling about $202 million. A tabulation showing, by country, the
                            trade involved is contained in Annex 8(b).</p>

                            a protocol embodying the results of the 1960-61 Tariff Conference and

                                rate is half of ours.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the

                        <p>I think it might be preferable in dealing with questions such as this in
                            the future if this justification were not employed. We have taken the
                            position with the rest of the world that we are seeking solutions of our
                            balance of payments through non-restrictive measures. For that reason we
                            are asking the cooperation of other nations in expanding our exports and
                            developing international trade. We have been urging with some success
                            that other countries follow lines of policy similar to ours.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that we justify restrictive actions, such as tariff
                            increases, on balance of payments grounds we impair the effectiveness of
                            our position. These actions should continue to be defended, it seems to
                            me, with the argument that imports were exacerbating already serious
                            unemployment in the affected industries. This is the basis on which I
                            shall explain the tariff actions to the Europeans while I am in Europe
                            during the next few days.</p>

                        <p>2692. For Under Secretary. Following is an informal translation of a
                            letter to Under Secretary from Spaak dated March 27. Letter received
                            March 30 from Belgian Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>"Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I have received your letter of March 19<note n="1" xml:id="d246fn1">Not
                                found.</note> and wish to thank you for the trouble you have taken
                            in writing it to me.</p>
                        <p>I presume that you desire from me my sincere impressions. I would not
                            conceal from you that the measure taken by the Government of the United
                            States to increase the customs duties on glass and carpets has caused a
                            very great reaction in my country and has even resulted in press
                            articles extremely disagreeable for the United States.</p>
                        <p>What has struck everyone, if you will permit me to mention it, is that
                            this action was taken a few days after an agreement had been reached
                            between the Common Market and the United States. Even if it is not
                            exact, one cannot overcome the impression of a great number of my
                            compatriots that the United States has waited for the success of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> negotiations to take
                            vis-a-vis Belgium extremely prejudicial measures.</p>
                        <p>My colleague, the Minister of Foreign Commerce, is strongly protesting
                            what has happened before the European Community which seems to have
                            promised him its support. This affair is going to have certain
                            ramifications, and I consider that regrettable. It would be in my view
                            highly desirable that the Government of the United States review its
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Accept, dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, best
                            wishes.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that before joining the others he wanted to say a few
                            words about the carpets and glass problem. We greatly regretted the
                            action that we had been obliged to take with respect to these two items
                            and we equally regretted the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> action
                            in the form of retaliation.<note n="1" xml:id="d248fn1">See <ref

                        <p>Belgium, the Secretary explained, had been the victim of a conjuncture of
                            circumstances that had forced us to increase tariffs on carpets and
                            glass. In the first place there was substantial unemployment in these
                            two industries, which had suffered serious injury as a result of a
                            substantial increase in imports.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of the problem which he wanted to mention most
                            confidentially to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> was
                            the need for the Administration to get the necessary Congressional
                            support for the President's Trade Expansion legislation. This was truly
                            a most far-reaching and indeed almost revolutionary bill in terms of our
                            traditional rather conservative approach to trade. Although the
                            Administration was pleased with the extent to which it had been able to
                            muster wide support, there were some hard-hitting opponents who had
                            charged that the Administration had in the past ignored peril points and
                            escape clause action and that the features in the new bill designed to
                            give legitimate security to American industry would be similarly
                            ignored. It had been necessary to give evidence of the Administration's
                            will to act and the items, by unfortunate coincidence, had been ones in
                            which Belgium was primarily interested. While regretting this, the
                            Secretary emphasized again that both the carpet and glass industries
                            were in serious condition and the action had been justified.</p>
                        <p>As to the future, the Secretary believed that we must let matters stand
                            where they now are and consider the matter closed. We had taken action
                            that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> countries had felt injured
                            them and they had retaliated instead of negotiating compensation.
                            Therefore, we would withdraw our compensation offer and the
                            negotiations, which had been terminated by <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> retaliation, would end.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName> said that he understood
                            the situation but asked whether, in the case of carpets, it would not be
                            possible to establish some “contingent” (quota). He explained that
                            several thousand families in the Courtrai area would be unemployed
                            because substantial segments of the carpet industry which traditionally
                            had supplied the American market could not survive. He said this fact
                            had created particular “emotion” with the public and with Foreign
                            Commerce Minister Brasseur and also with Finance Minister Dequae, who
                            came from Courtrai. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SPH1">Spaak</persName>
                            believed it was most important for the President to obtain passage of
                            his Trade Bill, but at the same time hoped something might be done in
                            the case of carpets to permit the industry to survive.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that for the moment he did not believe it possible
                            to do anything. As to the future, we would see.</p>

                            the textile industry is acutely aware of the fact that once the trade
                            bill is passed its bargaining power will be greatly diminished. It is,
                            therefore, using the Senate action on the trade bill as the occasion for
                            a last minute effort to squeeze out maximum concessions to insulate the
                            American market from foreign competition.</p>
                        <p>The industry is mounting pressure through its Congressional supporters

                        <p rend="center">Short and Long Term Cotton Textile Agreements</p>
                        <p>The short-term agreement worked out at Geneva last year expires September
                            30. Meanwhile, the member nations have agreed on a new five-year
                            agreement. Apart from Great Britain, none of the nations has
                            definitively committed itself to sign the new agreement, and presumably
                            signatures will not be received until after the Trade Expansion Act is
                            finally passed. The Governments concerned wish to make sure that nothing
                            is done through the Trade Expansion Act or otherwise that would impose
                            further burdens or limitations on cotton textile imports into the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Both the short-term and long-term agreements provide for some
                            administrative discretion in imposing restraints on imports, since, <pb
                                n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0559"/>before requesting that imports
                            from a particular country be limited, the Administration must find that
                            additional imports would be market disruptive.</p>
                        <p>In practice, you have told the industry that the agreements will be so
                            administered as to limit imports to six percent of domestic production.
                            This was explicitly stated in your letter to Carl Vinson.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d249fn2">For the President's letter to Representative
                                Vinson, June 27, see the Supplement.</note></p>
                        <p>During the first few months of the short-term agreement there was a
                            certain amount of slippage primarily for three reasons: First, adequate
                            administrative machinery had not yet been established, and no one had
                            any experience in operating the mechanical arrangements. Second, it was
                            not until June 18, 1962 that Congress provided us with the authority to
                            impose restraints on countries not members of the agreement. Third, the
                            foreign governments themselves did not fully understand how the
                            agreement worked and there were questions about its interpretation which
                            have since been cleared up.</p>
                        <p>In spite of this slippage, however, which resulted in shipments at an
                            annual rate well over six percent during the early months, we are
                            confident that <hi rend="italic">for the whole year of the short-term
                                agreement imports will not exceed the six percent limit you set in
                                your letter to Chairman Vinson</hi>. The Department of Commerce has
                            now perfected its administrative apparatus and by August 6 over 75% of
                            the import movement of cotton textile products had been put under
                            restraint.</p>
                        <p>There should be no serious problem of slippage under the long-term
                            agreement which comes into effect on the first of October and runs for
                            five years. In the case of one or two of the countries where the base
                            under the long-term agreement has been slightly inflated due to the
                            slippage it may be necessary to negotiate some downward adjustment of
                            that base. However, this should not be too difficult once the long-term
                            agreement has become operative.</p>
                        <p>In short, I see no reason why we cannot maintain the six percent import
                            ceiling you have promised.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>It would have disastrous consequences for our relations with a
                                number of textile producing countries—particularly Japan. The
                                Japanese have made this issue a test of our good faith. They have
                                been among the principal victims of almost every trade action we
                                have taken during <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0560"/>the past
                                year and are in a highly sensitive mood. At the same time, they are
                                acutely aware of the fact that US-Japanese trade in 1961 benefitted
                                our balance of payments by a net $700 million.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Imposition of the cotton equalization fee would destroy the
                                long-term agreement. There is no question about this. The leading
                                textile-producing nations have put us on notice that, if we impose
                                the equalization fee, they will reject the long-term agreement. (In
                                this connection, we should not be misled by statements of some
                                members of the industry that they would prefer the equalization fee
                                to the long-term agreement. These two devices would not accomplish
                                the same purpose. The equalization fee would principally operate to
                                restrict the import of primary processed textiles such as yarn and
                                grey goods. It would not materially affect the rate of importation
                                of household textiles or of apparel since the raw cotton content is
                                a much smaller proportion of the value of those products. Thus, if
                                we were to impose the equalization fee and let the long-term
                                agreement go down the drain, we would inevitably be confronted with
                                a situation of greatly expanded exports of apparel and finished
                                textiles and anguished demands for the imposition of quotas. In
                                other words, we would be back where we started from eighteen months
                                ago.)</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The imposition of an equalization fee would require the United
                                States to provide compensation in the form of tariff concessions on
                                other products with respect to over $200 million of annual trade,
                                since cotton tariffs are bound under earlier trade agreements. As a
                                consequence we would begin the operation of the Trade Expansion Act

                            <item>The equalization fee is a logical monstrosity. It does not make
                                sense for the United States Government to maintain high cotton price
                                supports which result in an artificially high price for cotton on
                                the domestic market; pay an export subsidy in order to make it
                                possible for cotton exporters to sell at the world price; and then
                                put a tariff on cotton textile imports to equalize the raw cotton
                                cost to American textile producers. The cotton textile industry
                                would be better advised to terminate its alliance with the large
                                cotton farmers who oppose a compensatory payment system. Even if the
                                textile producers had the protection of an equalization fee, they
                                would be pricing cotton textiles out of the market as against the
                                competition of man-made fibers.</item>

                                        woolen textile imports are concentrated in three countries:
                                        the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan.</p>
                                    <p>Our trade with the United Kingdom is of long standing and
                                        reasonably stable. We cannot deal with the United Kingdom as
                                        though it were a low-wage producer pouring disruptive
                                        imports into our market, as we dealt with the cotton

                                        three years due to the modernization of the Italian
                                        industry. But again we cannot treat Italy as though it were

                                        this point would mean the death of the long-term cotton
                                        textile agreement</hi>. When we first began negotiating the
                                    cotton textile agreement, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan and
                                    certain other countries put us on notice that they were
                                    participating in the negotiations only on the condition that the
                                    principle of the agreement would not be extended to other fibers

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Present Rate of Imports</hi>. New high import duties
                            became effective on January 1, 1961. These had the effect of imposing
                            restrictions on woolen fabrics imports almost at the level of the
                            Smoot-Hawley Tariff. Since those new duties came into effect, imports
                            have never regained the 1960 peak. They are presently running at an
                            annual rate just slightly above the 1961 level, and one-third under the
                            1960 level.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Raw Wool Tariff</hi>. As in the case of the cotton
                            textile industry, our wool textile producers face the problem of high
                            raw material costs. The United States is the only major manufacturer of
                            wool textiles that imposes a protective duty on raw wool imports. Since
                            we import more than two-thirds of our raw wool requirements, the logical
                            point at which to tackle the problem is the tariff on raw wool. Here
                            again the solution could best be found through some form of compensatory
                            payment to wool producers.</p>
                        <p>If we go on increasing the tariff on woolen textiles—or if we impose some
                            restrictions that have the same price effect—we shall simply be pricing
                            woolen textiles out of the domestic market by encouraging the
                            development and production of man-made fibers. Unfortunately, the woolen
                            textile industry persists in aligning itself on the side of the raw wool
                            producers. It follows this course not only to improve its political
                            leverage but also because a part of its tariff protection has been
                            justified as a compensation for the raw wool tariff and the industry
                            feels that there is some concealed extra protection for it in this
                            compensatory element.</p>

                            However, in order to induce other nations to attend that meeting we had

                        <p>We have been very disturbed by the progress through Congress of the Bill
                            which would double the duty on lightweight bicycles with curved frames.
                            I understand that the Senate is expected to vote on it very shortly, and
                            that, if this vote is favourable, the Bill will become law unless it is
                            vetoed by the President.</p>
                        <p>In itself this would be a severe blow to the British bicycle industry,
                            which has been doing a valuable trade in these machines with the United
                            States. But what disturbs me even more is that this Bill is only the
                            latest of a series of obstacles put in the way of our exports to the
                            United States. I have in mind the difficulties we have experienced over
                            glass and carpets, <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0563"/>the wool
                            tariff, the valuation for duty on chemicals, the duties on bottled
                            whisky, certain aspects of the “Buy-American” Campaign, and so on. The
                            cumulative effect of all these measures, particularly if the latest Bill
                            is added to them, is to raise serious doubts about the United States
                            Administration's ability to withstand protectionist pressure from
                            domestic industry.</p>
                        <p>We here have made no secret of our admiration for the lead you have given
                            the world by advocating liberal trade policies. If, however, public
                            opinion in the United Kingdom decided that the United States Government
                            were themselves unable in practice to apply these policies, the reaction
                            would be very serious, and would not be confined to the commercial firms
                            chiefly concerned. This is something which both of us are anxious to
                            avoid, and it is this which prompts me to address this message to you. I
                            know that you have done everything you can to oppose this Bill, and I am
                            most grateful. If it should be passed by Congress despite your efforts,
                            however, I do most earnestly beg of you to do everything possible to see
                            that it does not become law.<note n="1" xml:id="d250fn1">On September 4,

                            for consideration. This bill has the effect by reclassification of <pb

                            Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and other Executive
                            agencies.</p>

                            8938.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for my opposition are that: <list>
                                <item>—The Bill is an example of unilateral tariffmaking by special
                                    legislation, and as such is contrary to the new Trade Expansion
                                    Act.</item>
                                <item>—In doubling bicycle tariffs, the Bill will likely produce
                                    prompt retaliation by the United Kingdom, the Common Market
                                    countries, Japan and Austria—retaliation of the kind recently
                                    generated by escape clause action on carpets and glass. This
                                    retaliation will adversely affect United States exports at a
                                    time when we are trying to increase them.</item>
                                <item>—The Bill will undermine confidence in United States
                                    negotiated tariff commitments, and prejudice the bargaining
                                    position of your Chief Negotiator in the upcoming crucial
                                    negotiations with the European Economic Community.</item>
                                <item>—The bicycle industry has made no effort to show that it is
                                    suffering serious competitive injury from imports; in the
                                    absence of such injury, unilateral action on this tariff will
                                    violate an existing international agreement of the United
                                    States.</item>
                                <item>—The industry has not availed itself of the administrative

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: In requesting that you
                            accept the responsibility of serving as Special Representative for Trade
                                Negotiations,<note n="1" xml:id="d253fn1">Chapter 5, Section 241 of

                                authority to appoint individuals to this position. The law specifies
                                that the Special Trade Representative's primary responsibility is to
                                “seek information and advice with respect to each negotiation from
                                representatives of industry, agriculture, and labor, and from such
                                agencies as he deems appropriate.” (<hi rend="italic">American
                                    Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962</hi>, p. 1390)</note> I
                            believe it appropriate that I indicate to you the importance with which
                            I view this assignment, the scope of the task, and the goals toward
                            which our efforts should be directed.</p>
                        <p>As you know, I accorded to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 the high
                            priority, the non-partisan support, and the unqualified commitment which
                            must be provided legislation which affects the vital security interests
                            of the United States both here and abroad. I requested and received
                            authority from the Congress not only to pursue agreements on trade and
                            tariffs which would accommodate our national needs for expanding markets
                            and thereby contribute to our economic strength and growth, but also to
                            create entirely new reciprocal trading arrangements which would
                            measurably contribute to the economic, political and military strength
                            and solidarity of the free world. Notable among these broader purposes
                            is the determination to build a more closely-knit Atlantic Community, to
                            accord to other industrialized countries outside the Common Market such
                            as Japan and Canada a role in world trade commensurate to their
                            importance as partners in the struggle with world communism, and to
                            afford the less-developed countries the consideration and access to
                            markets and sources of supply which will hasten their development under
                            circumstances of free choice. Thus, the importance of this task and the
                            scope of interest and endeavor of the Special Representative transcends
                            the particulars of negotiations on trade and tariff matters. This work
                            goes to the very heart of the many policies and programs, domestic and
                            foreign, which will help to shape the world environment in which the
                            United States must maintain initiative, command respect, and provide
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I shall look to the Special Representative to advise and
                            assist me directly in helping to shape our international trade and
                            economic policies as well as spearheading the major negotiating effort
                            abroad which lies ahead.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>To this end, the Special Representative will necessarily be accorded a
                            central role in the formulation of trade policy. He will chair the new
                            Cabinet-level interdepartmental committee which will replace the present
                            Trade Policy Committee. He will be directly responsible for preparing
                            the proposed objectives and strategies for negotiations and for
                            directing those negotiations while they are in process. In a broader
                            sense he will become, along with the Secretaries of State and Commerce,
                            one of the top policy officials of the U.S. Government in shaping and
                            achieving our international objectives in the commercial, trade, and
                            economic fields.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that we fully agree on the broad purposes and goals sought
                            in this program; that we fully share the sense of urgency and
                            determination with which this effort must be pursued; and that we
                            appreciate the magnitude and difficulty of the task. It is on this basis
                            that I have sought to enlist your efforts to the historic task which
                            presents such opportunity and challenge for our country.</p>

                        <p>In the Treasury's submission of September 28 to the Cabinet Committee,
                            the payments projections for 1964 indicated an over-all U.S. deficit of
                            $1 billion rather than our stated objective of equilibrium. In view of
                            the shortfall, Commerce undertook to prepare a detailed program <pb
                                n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0568"/>designed to raise the export
                            level, presently projected at $23.2 billion. The report under review
                            (Tab A) contains the recommendations that have resulted from Commerce's
                                work.<note n="1" xml:id="d254fn1">For text of the Department of
                                Commerce's proposal for an Export Expansion Program, November 8, see
                                the Supplement.</note></p>
                        <p>The Commerce program comprises twelve major elements, summarized below.
                            With a few exceptions, the program presents no problems for us. Commerce
                            has not shown, however, how the program's elements, singly or in
                            combination, can be expected to contribute to the necessary $1 billion
                            increase in exports, but such a showing is probably not feasible.
                            Commerce estimates that, to carry out the program, $4.05 million in
                            supplemental appropriations will be needed for FY 1963 and that
                            appropriation requests for FY 1964 will have to be increased by $13
                            million.</p>

                                providing an incentive for export promotion without permitting
                                windfall profits as a result of expenses which, more or less, would

                                computed. As a result, such expenses would cost a profitable company
                                only 37.6 cents per dollar after taxes, compared with 48 cents per

                                after-tax export promotion costs of 30 cents and 25 cents per
                                dollar, respectively, by profitable firms in each country, compared
                                with 65 cents and 50 cents, respectively, for all other deductible

                                    Quite possibly the President will wish to request the staff of

                                <item>Upon the completion of the Study Group meeting in December, we
                                    should set in motion the machinery for a special negotiation
                                    under section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act<note n="3"

                                        Expansion Act of 1962, the President had the authority to
                                        “enter into trade agreements with foreign countries or
                                        instrumentalities thereof” after June 30, 1962, and before

                                    regard to import duties on wool textiles. This procedure would
                                    involve the publication of a list of the articles—wool textiles
                                    upon which we want higher duties plus other articles upon which
                                    we would cut tariffs as compensation—to be considered during
                                    such a negotiation. The list would be submitted to the Tariff
                                    commission for advice concerning the probable economic effect of
                                    tariff modifications with respect to each article. Public
                                    hearings would be held simultaneously by the Tariff Commission
                                    and an interagency trade committee. When the Tariff Commission
                                    makes its recommendation based upon its hearings and when the
                                    President receives a summary of the hearings held by the
                                    interagency committee, he may then initiate the negotiation.
                                    While the statute gives the Tariff Commission six months to make
                                    its findings, this process could be speeded up in this instance
                                    since the list of articles would not be broad and the White
                                    House interest in quick resolution could be brought to
                                    bear.</item>

                        <p>I recognize that the above program may cause disappointment in
                            Congressional circles. But, as was made abundantly clear in the
                            discussion of the Textile Committee, there is no cheap, quick, or easy
                            way to achieve the required restraint on woolen textile imports. The
                            situation is wholly different from that prevailing with regard to cotton
                            textiles and—even with the best of luck—we shall be able to meet our
                            commitment to restrain woolen textiles only at substantial cost to our
                            political and trading interests.</p>

                        <p>The suggested program is the best I have been able to devise. It is
                            awkward and costly, but any alternative I can think of would be far
                            worse for us in every way.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Committee has reviewed all of our programs designed to achieve a
                            reasonable equilibrium in the balance of payments of the United States.
                            It concludes that good progress has been made in our programs for
                            reducing or offsetting U.S. Government expenditures abroad and for
                            strengthening the international monetary system so as to protect the
                            dollar against strains arising from large international movements of
                            short-term funds. These programs must be vigorously followed up.</p>
                        <p>In the Committee's judgment, however, we must look mainly to exports for
                            substantial further reductions in our basic payments deficit. Government
                            and business together must make vigorous efforts to increase our
                            commercial surplus—the excess of exports of goods and services over
                            imports—to a level adequate to cover our necessary net payments abroad
                            for defense, economic assistance, and private investment. This task is
                            not easy. It can only be accomplished through a broad and determined
                            national effort.</p>
                        <p>At present, our exports account for only 4 percent of our gross national
                            product, whereas Italy exports about 12 percent of <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss>, Germany about 15 percent and the
                            United Kingdom over 16 percent.</p>
                        <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0575"/>
                        <p>Our businessmen must do more. But government can in many ways provide
                            leadership, point out export opportunities and help sales. We have
                            established new, and have expanded existing, programs—notably in the
                            Department of Commerce and the Export-Import Bank—to do this. However,
                            the Committee has concluded that additional sales promotion efforts by
                            the business community and the U.S. Government are now required if we
                            are to achieve our goal of balance of payments equilibrium within a
                            reasonable period.</p>
                        <p>These efforts must, of course, occur against the backdrop of continued
                            policies to ensure that our products are competitive with those of other
                            nations and have fair access to their markets. This means continued
                            price stability, as well as continuous improvement of our products. It
                            also means vigorous negotiations on tariff and non-tariff barriers to
                            trade with other nations—particularly those of the European Common
                            Market. Especially important over the long run will be a successful
                            outcome of negotiations under the Trade Expansion Act.</p>

                        <p>Bearing in mind that government cannot itself increase exports, but can
                            only lead the way and provide assistance to the thousands of U.S.
                            businessmen on whose efforts achievement of balance of payments
                            equilibrium depends, the Committee recommends adoption of the following
                            action program: <list>

                                    <p>Pursuant to your directives at the beginning of your
                                        administration, the Export-Import Bank has improved existing
                                        facilities and, in cooperation with a large group of private
                                        insurance companies, has formed the Foreign Credit Insurance
                                        Association (FCIA), which provides completely new
                                        export-credit insurance facilities.</p>
                                    <p>These programs must be and are being continually reassessed
                                        to assure their maximum effectiveness and their continued
                                        adaptation to changing circumstances. During recent months,
                                        the Bank, in cooperation with Treasury, Commerce, and the
                                        FCIA, has sought out and carefully reviewed comments and
                                        specific suggestions from major commercial banks and
                                        exporters as to the adequacy and usefulness of these
                                        programs, and a number of significant improvements in the
                                        coverage and administration of the programs have been
                                        adopted. The latest such improvements, announced early in
                                        January, are a general reduction in rates charged for FCIA
                                        coverage combined with a revised classification of countries
                                        for rate-fixing purposes and the offering of an optional
                                        coverage for political risks only.</p>
                                    <p>Accordingly, American exporters now enjoy credit facilities
                                        which are believed to be the equal of those anywhere in the
                                        world.</p>
                                    <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0576"/>
                                    <p>In addition, the Bank and the FCIA, in cooperation with the
                                        Department of Commerce, must now make a major and continuing
                                        effort to bring these facilities to the attention of banks
                                        and businessmen throughout the country. This effort is
                                        already under way, but must and will be further broadened
                                        and intensified. Effective promotion of these new facilities
                                        will do more than simply inform businessmen of the
                                        export-financing aids now available: it can also be a major
                                        tool for making them better aware of the potentialities of
                                        foreign markets.</p></item>

                                    <p>The Department of Commerce and American embassies and
                                        consulates abroad have long provided an array of different
                                        types of services designed to aid individual American
                                        exporters in locating potential foreign markets and
                                        successfully selling their products abroad. Among these are
                                        the development of U.S. export opportunities, the
                                        preparation of general and specific market analyses, the
                                        provision of credit information, and help in contacting
                                        foreign business firms.</p>
                                    <p>Broader and more intensified efforts are now called for in
                                        these areas, as well as to get companies already exporting
                                        to do a better job; to persuade top management that
                                        exporting should become one of its major concerns; to
                                        interest new firms in the potentialities of the export
                                        market; and to intensify our marketing efforts.</p>

                                            <p>The first task is to see that top management gives
                                                greater attention to exports. This is a task to
                                                which the Administration at all levels must devote
                                                itself. Major responsibility must rest with the
                                                Department of Commerce, particularly with its Bureau
                                                of International Commerce. The export expansion
                                                activities of this Bureau and other parts of the

                                                increased in strength. It is also proposed that the

                                                appointed, and that the Department of Commerce field

                                                should supplement the efforts of the expanded

                                                of every exporter and potential exporter the profit
                                                and growth opportunities to be found in
                                                exporting.</p>
                                            <p>Information on potential export markets has been
                                                available, but not in the depth businessmen require.
                                                Much more detailed surveys of markets for particular
                                                products are needed. Trade associations and industry
                                                groups could supplement the efforts of individual
                                                government experts in evaluating the markets for a
                                                particular product in a number of countries, with a
                                                portion of the expense borne by the Government.
                                                These studies need to be sharply and rapidly
                                                expanded.</p></item>

                                            <p>Related both to the task of promotion abroad, and to
                                                that discussed above, is a proposed increase in the
                                                budget for the overseas commercial services. It is
                                                on our commercial officers overseas that the
                                                continuing, day-to-day, responsibility of reporting
                                                on export opportunities and market potential rests.
                                                It is they who must lay the groundwork and establish
                                                contacts for the special teams of Washington experts
                                                or businessmen who come to seek out specific export
                                                opportunities.</p>
                                            <p>When firms have been interested in exporting, the
                                                task remains of actually getting American salesmen
                                                overseas with samples and order books, and foreign
                                                buyers here with check books. To this task, existing
                                                programs can make a direct contribution, and should
                                                be expanded.</p>

                                                trade missions, and the establishment of trade
                                                centers, a wide variety of American goods can be

                                                  until now, trade fairs have been utilized

                                                  will permit Commerce to mount or prepare for
                                                  pavilion-type exhibits in seven major cities,

                                                  opportunities. More American business firms can be
                                                  persuaded to exhibit at trade fairs on a
                                                  continuing basis, provided government initially
                                                  assumes a share of the expense. (For example, the
                                                  first year the government might pay 75% of the

                                                  This procedure would encourage a maximum number of
                                                  U.S. companies to explore the market.) The amount
                                                  provided for this program next year should be more
                                                  than doubled.</p>
                                                  <p>In addition, a small appropriation should be

                                                  buyers, distributors and agents, and can bring
                                                  about direct sales far in excess of the

                                                  segment of industry seeking export opportunities
                                                  in their own particular field in places which
                                                  market surveys have determined to have the highest
                                                  potential. Some missions will also be needed to

                                                  newly-independent countries. In these missions,

                                                  <p>In the fall of 1962 Commerce sponsored the

                                                  represent-ative accompanies the group. On its

                                                  substantially less than that of an official
                                                  government mission. Two other trade associations
                                                  have already taken the initiative to form

                                                  might be formed through industry groups, and the

                                                  promotion which has proved successful in many
                                                  other countries is to bring foreign buyers to the
                                                  exporting country. Selected foreign buyers should
                                                  be brought to this country for such events as the
                                                  furniture show, the housewares show, the appliance
                                                  show, etc. The American businesses which will
                                                  benefit should bear all of the costs of such a
                                                  program, although in certain cases it may be
                                                  desirable for the government to pay part of the
                                                  costs. Particular efforts will be made to get
                                                  American business to advertise its shows overseas.
                                                  A major part of the modest cost of this operation
                                                  lies in determining what items should be promoted,
                                                  where they should be promoted, and following up to

                        <p>The budgetary costs of the program outlined above are very small when
                            contrasted to the importance of achieving equilibrium in our balance of
                            payments. A table showing the amounts which have been included for this
                            program in the Budget is attached as Annex I.<note n="1"

                        <p>Adopting the above recommendations will not guarantee the increased
                            export effort we need—only American business can do that; but failure to
                            adopt them would be to avoid a small cost and accept a high risk—one
                            that we should not and need not take.</p>

                                Program</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The program submitted to you by the Cabinet Committee involves a modest
                            increase in expenditures, approximately $11 million, for the purpose of
                            improving our export expansion program. These funds are contained in the
                            budget requests which you have forwarded to the Congress. The chief
                            difficulty in obtaining acceptance of this program will be with
                            Congressman Rooney who has been consistently averse to any personnel
                            increases in non-political activities abroad. Without some special
                            effort on your part it is certain that he will sabotage this
                            program.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you arrange to see Mr. Rooney at the White House on this
                            matter at an early date, either alone, or with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> and me present. The object would
                            be to point out to him the extreme gravity <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554"
                                facs="0580"/>of our balance of payments situation and the
                            contribution which can and must be made by expanded exports. This being
                            the case, any doubts about the efficacy of a modest program such as has
                            been recommended must, in the overall national interest, be resolved in
                            favor of acceptance of the full program.</p>
                        <p>I would also suggest that you formally approve the report of the Cabinet
                            Committee on Export Promotion, and forward it to Commerce, State and the
                            Export-Import Bank for prompt implementation preferably accompanied by a
                            brief memorandum indicating your personal interest in export
                                expansion.<note n="1" xml:id="d257fn1">On January 29, President

                                Balance of Payments, informing them that he had read the memorandum
                                on the Export Expansion Program and that “it has my full support and
                                I would like you to give top priority to carrying out its
                                recommendations, in view of the importance of exports to our balance
                                of payments.” (Kennedy Library, Herter Papers, Balance of Payments,
                                1963)</note> It could then be transmitted to the Congress in the
                            most appropriate fashion for use in the appropriation hearings,
                            stressing that it has your full support, as well as that of the entire
                            Cabinet Committee on Balance of Payments. This should give Mr. Rooney an
                            adequate excuse to reverse his long-standing position on this
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>Since appropriation hearings will start very soon it would be helpful if
                            you could see Mr. Rooney some time next week.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador said that when the Japanese applied voluntary controls to
                            cotton textiles, they were apprehensive about the possibility that these
                            restrictions would be applied to woolen textiles. The U.S. gave
                            assurances that this was not intended. He pointed out that Article 1 of
                            the LTA<note n="1" xml:id="d258fn1">The Long-Term Arrangement Regarding
                                International Trade in Cotton Textiles (LTA) was signed in Geneva
                                under <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> auspices by 19 countries
                                in 1962. Its purpose was to ensure orderly development of the cotton
                                textile trade to allow for growth of exports while not damaging
                                markets of importing countries.</note> recognized that the cotton
                            textile industry had “special problems.” At the London meeting of the
                            International Wool Study Group assurances were received from the U.S.
                            that it was not considering the extension of the LTA to wool textiles.
                            On various occasions the Japanese Embassy has discussed this question
                            with the Department and has always been assured that the U.S. was not
                            thinking of the extension of restrictions to wool textiles.</p>
                        <p>Recently, however, the Ambassador said, the Japanese Government had
                            received reports from Geneva that the U.S. was thinking of a formula for
                            curtailing imports of woolen goods. This had caused embarrassment to the
                            Japanese Embassy, which was under the impression that the U.S.
                            assurances still stood. The Ambassador had received instructions to
                            obtain the Under Secretary's thinking on this matter.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary confirmed the Ambassador's recollection that the U.S.
                            had been very explicit regarding this matter. He pointed out, however,
                            that the U.S. had a practical problem with respect to increased <pb
                                n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0582"/>imports of wool textiles. He
                            said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> had been
                            discuss-ing with Mr. Wyndham White (the Executive Secretary of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) the possibility that
                            something might be worked out which would provide some relief of the
                            pressure from increased imports but which would also result in a
                            reduction in U.S. duties on raw wool and the compensating duties on wool
                            textiles. A meeting in Geneva is planned for early February for the
                            purpose of working out the matter, but not necessarily to apply the LTA
                            to wool textiles.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked if the U.S. was thinking of a quota system. The
                            Under Secretary replied that we are disturbed by the problem but are
                            open minded. He pointed out that woolen tariffs are already high.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> recalled that at
                            the London meeting we had said we did not come to propose restrictions
                            or to propose an extension of the LTA. Various countries, including
                            Japan, had suggested that one of the problems was the cost of the fiber,
                            which was related to the tariff on raw wool. We had laid out the problem
                            to Mr. Wyndham White but made no suggestion as to how it might be
                            handled. The consultation meeting of exporters in Geneva on February 4
                            is designed to explore various solutions, and if at a certain point in
                            the discussions the U.S. should, upon invitation, send a representative,
                            it would be with an open mind.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador expressed some surprise. He said his Embassy had
                            repeatedly told Tokyo that the U.S. did not have restrictions in mind;
                            he said the Japanese did not want to see the U.S. enter into discussions
                            of a formula similar to the LTA.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> said that Mr.
                            Wyndham White thought this problem sufficiently important in relation to
                            the forthcoming tariff negotiations that it should be explored with the
                            exporters. Such a meeting has been set at Geneva. What will happen after
                            that meeting is not known. Perhaps the discussions will be expanded to
                            include the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the Japanese do not want questions of import
                            restrictions to pile up, one by one. He asked that Japan be told as soon
                            as possible the line of U.S. thinking.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary explained that we have a problem, but no solution at
                            the moment. The problem is that imports have increased since 1955 from
                            10 to 20 percent of domestic production. We would be glad to keep the
                            Ambassador advised after the Geneva meeting as to what our actions will
                            be. There is a possibility for considerable reductions in raw wool
                            tariffs and in compensatory duties on wool textiles.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said the Japanese were surprised to hear of these
                            developments regarding possible U.S. wool textile import
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> explained that from
                            the U.S. point of view, the problem at the London meeting was to point
                            out that we had a serious problem. A possibility mentioned there was a
                            “standstill” on imports for a period of time plus a lowering of our raw
                            wool duties. The U.S. has made <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0583"
                            />no proposal but was desirous of exploring with the exporters some
                            mutually agreeable formula and that the “standstill” idea was one
                            possibility which, while we had not officially proposed it, we were
                            interested to explore.</p>

                                >GATT</gloss>, problem and above alternative courses. Recent meeting
                            of International Wool Study Group in London had indicated that <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> was proper forum for discussion
                            problem faced by US re wool textiles. Although Wyndham White believed
                            there would be great difficulty in securing agreement from other
                            governments, he felt it was necessary, in view commitment which has been
                            made by Administration and fact some action will be taken by US in any
                            event, to sound out <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Japan, and <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> re possibility multilateral approach to
                            this problem involving limited number of countries. He felt that an
                            indispensable part of such approach would be action by US to reduce raw
                            wool duties accompanied by corresponding reductions in specific duties
                            on wool textiles. This sounding out now in proc-ess on highly
                            confidential and informal basis. Meeting of these countries will be held
                            in Geneva February 4. On basis this meeting, it is possible that US will
                            be invited to participate at similar meeting ten days to two weeks
                            later. (Canberra note Australia not involved in February 4 meeting but

                            made it clear that the effect of the present E.E.C. policy is to price
                            U.S. poultry out of Community countries.</p>
                        <p>The background of this, according to the Department of Agriculture, is
                            that poultry meat consumption in Community countries has been increasing
                            much more rapidly than production in recent years. There was an increase
                            of net imports into the area from 29 million pounds in 1955 to 181
                            million in 1960. In the same period, U.S. exports of frozen poultry to
                            the E.E.C. rose to 93 million pounds from 0.1 million pounds. In 1961,
                            the 128 million pounds of fresh and frozen poultry the United States
                            shipped to the Federal Republic of Germany accounted for 85 per cent of
                            the 150 million pounds shipped to the entire Community area.</p>
                        <p>Now, however, according to our poultry producers, exports to the Federal
                            Republic of Germany have been reduced to nearly nothing since August 1,
                            1962, the effective date of the E.E.C.'s increased tariff
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>We are sure you appreciate the fact that the American poultry industry
                            operates without any price support or production control program, and
                            seeks only an opportunity to compete fairly within the Community's
                            markets.</p>
                        <p>It would be most helpful to have a report on your schedule for pursuing
                            this problem with the E.E.C. and its member governments, with particular
                            reference to whatever provisions of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962<note

                                <persName corresp="#p_KC2">Carl Kaysen</persName> on the telephone
                            explaining his role: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"On this wool thing, I am a little annoyed and disturbed because
                                    the President now is sending me various messages through
                                        <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>, through the
                                    Secretary, and so on, to the effect that after all this was my
                                    commitment as much as his; that I was present when it was made
                                    and so on. I was not present when it was made, and if there is
                                    anything I have done over the last two years it's to fight it
                                    alone, a rear-guard action against the wool and the whole
                                    textile business. Now, this is one of Mike's operations—you
                                    know, to say to the President: ‘Well, after all, George told you
                                    to do it, and so on.' What happened was that after the
                                    commitment was made I simply said ‘I don't know how in the hell
                                    we'll do it, but we'll do our best.' This is the only thing one
                                    could say. But now I find myself in a position where I am
                                    getting blamed for getting him into misguided commitment, which
                                    couldn't just be further from the truth. I don't know quite how
                                    to handle that; I'll have to give some thought to it.”

                        <p>I was concerned when you told me of the President's comment to you on
                            Thursday morning that I had been present when the commitment was made to
                            the woolen textile Congressmen. This is a misunderstanding. To the best
                            of my recollection—and I am confident of my memory on this point—I have
                            never been present at any meeting with the President when he talked
                            about woolen textiles with any member of Congress or the textile
                            industry, and I have consistently advised against any commitment on
                            woolen textiles.</p>
                        <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0588"/>
                        <p>Obviously, I regard a promise of the President as a solemn undertaking
                            and will do whatever he feels is justified to carry it out. At the same
                            time, it would trouble me deeply if I thought the President felt I had
                            misled him into a promise that can be carried out only at great
                            cost.</p>
                        <p>Once the Administration had given its commitment in Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s letter to the industry dated
                            August 7, 1962,<note n="1" xml:id="d262fn1">Not found.</note> I did tell
                            the President that we would try our best to find ways and means to keep
                            it. But I also made it clear that this was going to be very difficult
                            and costly.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">How the Commitment was Made</hi></p>
                        <p>The facts are as follows:</p>
                        <p>When the Cabinet Textile Committee was first established early in 1961, I
                            was the one member who insisted that the textile problem not be
                            approached as a whole since the cotton situation was clearly different
                            from that of wool. In all of the dealings that I had with the
                            representatives of the industry and with the Congress, I carefully
                            avoided any promise that we would do more than study the problem of
                            woolen textile imports. As you will recall, this was one of the points
                            on which Congress complained; over 150 Congressmen and 40 Senators
                            joined in letters to the President protesting my handling of the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>In July, 1961, in order to avoid the need to impose mandatory quotas on
                            cotton textiles—which all of the other members of the Cabinet Committee
                            were pressing to do—I offered instead to negotiate a multilateral
                            textile agreement. Such an agreement was unprecedented and not easy to
                            achieve—particularly since it had the effect of waiving any compensation
                            claims by the exporting nations. At that time, I made it clear to the
                            members of the Industry Committee present at Geneva—as well as to the
                            President's Cabinet Committee on Textiles—that the type of agreement
                            worked out for cotton could not be utilized for textiles from any other
                            fiber.</p>
                        <p>A cotton textile agreement was possible for one reason only. The markets
                            of the old industrialized countries of Europe and America were being
                            disrupted by low-wage textile products from less-developed countries.
                            The economically advanced countries therefore had a common interest in
                            developing a protective device against these imports which they could,
                            by common action, impose on the less-developed countries.</p>
                        <p>I was able to negotiate the cotton textile agreement only because the
                            special situation of cotton textiles permitted me to organize the
                            Atlantic nations into a common front to bring the low-wage producers
                            into line.</p>
                        <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0589"/>
                        <p>The situation with respect to woolen textiles is wholly different. Here
                            the increase in our imports comes almost entirely from three
                            countries—the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan.</p>
                        <p>The situation of wool, unlike that of cotton, does not permit us to make
                            common cause with the industrialized countries. Instead, we would have
                            to restrain imports from countries that are our principal allies and
                            customers. In view of our heavily favorable trade balance with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> our bargaining position would be very poor.</p>
                        <p>I made these points emphatically clear to the Cabinet Textile Committee
                            on every occasion when the matter of woolen textile imports arose.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">I may add that during this whole time I was under great
                                pressure from other members of the Committee to expand the scope of
                                the Administration's commitments to all sectors of the textile
                                industry. Those other members did not have to face the
                                responsibilities of negotiation or the realities of maintaining an
                                overall commercial policy favorable to the United States national
                                interest.</hi></p>
                        <p>On July 16, 1962, the National Association of Woolen Textile
                            Manufacturers wrote the White House indicating that the Board of
                            Directors of the Association had recently adopted a resolution calling,
                            among other things, for quantitative limitations, by categories and by
                            countries of origin, on imports of wool textile and apparel
                            products.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> prepared a draft reply
                            to the Association's letter that would have committed the Administration
                            to holding woolen textile imports to the fiscal year 1961 level. He
                            discussed this matter over the telephone with an officer of the
                            Department who was then in New York. That officer strongly advised Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> against such a
                            commitment and warned against the inclusion of such language in a letter
                            to the Association.</p>
                        <p>There is a discrepancy in the recollection of this conversation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> advises me that, after
                            considerable discussion, the State Department officer agreed to the
                            compromise language which was finally incorporated in the reply that was
                            sent on August 7. The State Department officer has a different
                            recollection. He recalls that he recommended against that language,
                            suggesting an alternative formulation that did not include an express
                            commitment.</p>
                        <p>In any event I was not personally consulted on this matter and knew
                            nothing about any letter to the woolen textile industry until after it
                            had already been sent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s letter to the wool
                            textile industry contained the following commitment: <quote

                        <p>As I recall, I requested a meeting with the President, which was held on

                            cotton and wool problems, pointing out the difficulties posed by the
                            commitment which the Administration had made in the August 7 letter. A
                            larger meeting was held with the President on the following day.<note

                            pointed out that, if we tried to impose restraints on woolen textiles we
                            would jeopardize the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement. My notes—and my
                            recollection—indicate that I made three additional points: (1) that the
                            situation of wool textiles was unlike that of cotton and that, in my
                            opinion, a multilateral agreement was non-negotiable; (2) that any
                            quantitative restrictions on wool textiles would require massive
                            compensation; and (3) that the nations participating in the Cotton
                            Textile Agreement had expressly stipulated that they would not enter
                            into a wool textile agreement. However, since it was felt that some
                            action was necessary, I agreed that when the accessions to the Long-Term
                            Agreement were completed we would try some exploratory probing.
                            Meanwhile, the President would advise interested members of Congress
                            that we would try to hold imports at or below “current levels” but
                            without specifying the exact percentage or how it would be done.</p>
                        <p>On <hi rend="italic">August 24</hi>, the President met with certain
                            Congressmen interested in the textile problem,<note n="4"

                            and an even larger meeting was held about a week later.<note n="5"

                                    >Kennedy</persName> met off-the-record with 17 Senators,
                                including Senator Pastore and Representative Vinson who had earlier,
                                in a letter of June 22, 1961, to President <persName

                                about problems in the U.S. textile industry and the President's
                                plans to address them. The congressional letter is printed as See

                                    target="#d220">Document 220</ref>.</note> I was not present at
                            either meeting, but, prior to the second one, the President telephoned
                            me in New York to say that he was meeting with a group of textile
                            Senators and Congressmen in about five minutes. We discussed various
                            points that he should make with regard to cotton textiles. When the
                            question of woolen textiles was raised, I replied that since a
                            commitment had already been made there was little the President could do
                            other than to try to make it clear that “current levels” did not mean
                            15% but something over 17%. I said that I did not know how we would be
                            able to carry out the Administration's promise, but we would do our
                            best.</p>
                        <p>That is the story so far as the making of the commitment is concerned. To
                            the best of my recollection, I was never present with the President when
                            woolen textiles were discussed with any Congressmen or <pb n="565"
                                xml:id="pg_565" facs="0591"/>Senators. The President, however,
                            remembers otherwise and I have more respect for his memory than for
                            mine. Until the time that the commitment was made to the industry, I did
                            my best to argue against it. Thereafter, I always tried to make it clear
                            that its fulfillment would be difficult and costly.</p>
                        <p>If, however—as I fear is the case—the President feels that I did not
                            adequately warn him about the difficulties of keeping the commitment,
                            then the fault is mine in not being sufficiently clear and explicit.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Efforts to Fulfill Commitment</hi></p>
                        <p>I think the record shows that the Department has tried, in good faith, to
                            keep the Administration's promise with respect to woolen textiles—while
                            at the same time seeking to keep the cost within reasonable limits.</p>
                        <p>Early in May, 1962, the Cabinet Textile Committee appointed a
                            subcommittee comprised of representatives of the Departments of State,
                            Commerce and Labor to examine what we might do with regard to the woolen
                            textile import problem. At an early meeting of that subcommittee, the
                            State Department representative proposed that we utilize the
                            International Wool Study Group as a forum for exploring this problem on
                            an international basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> opposed this course of action on the ground that
                            it would merely provide a forum for discussion and not a means of
                            negotiation. Upon becoming further acquainted with the difficulties, he
                            later agreed to a meeting of the Wool Study Group. In October the
                            Management Committee of the Wool Study Group finally agreed—reluctantly
                            and over loud objections from the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, who suspected our intentions—to
                            call a meeting for December. This accorded with our desire to do nothing
                            precipitous regarding wool until the necessary nations had finally
                            signed the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Trade Expansion legislation had, at Congressional
                            insistence, been revised so as to transfer responsibility for trade
                            negotiations from the State Department to the Chief Negotiator. As soon
                            as Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> was
                            appointed, I reviewed the woolen textile problem with him. I suggested
                            means for providing further protection to the woolen textile industry
                            through tariff increases. However, we recognized that this would be
                            unpopular with the industry.</p>
                        <p>During the Wool Study Group meeting in December, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> of the State Department,
                            tried to lay the basis for a possible future international agreement on
                            wool textiles. He found it very heavy going. Nevertheless, following the
                            meeting, I proposed to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WWW1"
                                >Wirtz</persName>, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> that we undertake an exploratory probe—offering
                            as bait a possible reduction in the United States tariff on raw wool.
                            Since Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> did not feel
                            that we were in position to promise such a reduction, it was agreed that
                            the United States <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0592"/>Government
                            would not itself approach foreign governments but that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WWE1">Eric Wyndham White</persName>, Executive Secretary
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, would be asked to
                            undertake some soundings on our behalf.</p>
                        <p>These explorations, conducted as discreetly as possible, still produced a
                            violent reaction from Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan. The
                            reaction was compounded by the fact that the proposal leaked to the
                            European press. Since then the gratuitous comment at the final press
                            conference of the outgoing Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Hickman
                            Price, that the Administration was definitely planning to take action to
                            restrict wool textile imports, has exacerbated an already bad
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Recently, the atmosphere of strain in the Western Alliance since
                            President De Gaulle's press conference<note n="6" xml:id="d262fn6">On

                            introduced a new element. The French are threatening to drag their feet
                            regarding the undertaking of any trade negotiations. The British are
                            concerned at any action on our part that might further jeopardize their
                            export earnings. The Japanese are threatening to withdraw from the
                            Cotton Textile Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In our talk with the President this week we should make clear the costs
                            and dangers involved in going forward with a program of restraining
                            woolen textile imports at this time.</p>

                            <item>Action to restrain woolen textiles would produce an explosion of
                                anger and resentment that would play into the hands of those
                                opposing our policies. The French are already using the fact that
                                the United States may try to restrain woolen textile imports to cast
                                doubt on the sincerity of our efforts to liberalize trade. This is
                                part of a general campaign to discredit American intentions with
                                regard to Europe.</item>

                            <item>The British would likely regard such an American move as
                                justification for their making a discriminatory deal with the

                                woolen textiles the Japanese would be likely to torpedo the

                                withdrawal of one major producing country would bring down the

                            <item>The effect of an action to restrain woolen textile imports would
                                create major domestic political problems. The United States would be
                                faced with compensation claims on over $200 million worth of trade.
                                This compensation takes the form of concessions in tariffs on other

                            negotiations would be seriously prejudiced.</p>

                            the Trade Expansion Act powers with any major effect. The French would
                            seize our wool textile action as an excuse to justify the maintenance of
                            high restrictions against American agricultural products. They would
                            almost certainly be joined by the Italians who stand to lose the most by
                            woolen textile restraints. Our exports not merely of poultry but of
                            wheat, feed grains and all other agricultural products would be
                            jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>I am not overstating the dimensions of the problem.</p>
                        <p>If our dilemma is fairly presented to the Congressmen and Senators
                            involved, they should be willing to forego pressure for restraint
                            action—at least for the time being. They will not like it—but they
                            should, at least, recognize the problem.</p>
                        <p>Certainly the changed climate in Europe has added a new factor not
                            present when the original commitment was made. Nor is this a case where
                            grave injustice is being done. The woolen textile industry is showing
                            record earnings. The most important companies in the industry make both
                            cotton and woolen textiles; thus they have already greatly benefited
                            from the Long-Term Cotton Agreement. They cannot say that the
                            Administration has done nothing for them.<note n="7" xml:id="d262fn7"

                        <p>The preparations for our negotiations with Europe under the Trade
                            Expansion Act are already under way and will be increasing in tempo and
                            scope. I am very much concerned that we do everything we can to bring
                            these important negotiations to a fruitful conclusion. In order to do
                            this, we must make sure that all the energies and skills available in
                            the government for this task are coordinated and focused on it. The
                            Secretary of State has the responsibility of providing Governor Herter,
                            the Trade Negotiator, with broad foreign policy guidance and I want to
                            be sure that the Department is organized to enable him to perform this
                            task adequately. Further, the Department must be continuously aware of
                            the need for putting these negotiations in their proper relation to our
                            other ongoing negotiations in Europe in the military, monetary and
                            political spheres. In this connection, I urge that all our European
                            embassies be made aware of the great importance that the government
                            attaches to these negotiations and their own heavy responsibility for
                            them. I suggest you re-examine the staffing of our major European
                            embassies with these responsibilities in mind and strengthen them
                            wherever necessary to enable them to perform these tasks
                            effectively.</p>
                        <p>I consider it equally important to bring all trade negotiations with the
                            European countries into connection with the over-all negotiation we are
                            entering into, so that no uncoordinated individual arrangements on
                            particular products or with particular countries are made.</p>
                        <p>I would like the Under Secretary of State to assume personal
                            responsibility for the State Department's activities in this sphere and
                            to keep me closely in touch with the progress of activities and any
                            problems that may arise through the Deputy Special Assistant for
                            National Security Affairs.</p>

                                    trade and diplomatic nature centering on the European countries,
                                    in addition to carrying on a large volume of more routine

                                    high importance, we are already preparing for our first round of
                                    negotiations under the Trade Expansion Act.</p>
                                <p>While the Secretary of State has the primary responsibility for
                                    the conduct of foreign policy, all of you are involved in one
                                    way or another in aspects of our relations with Europe. I think
                                    it is necessary that all our relations with Europe be conducted
                                    in a unified way and related to a central strategy aimed at the
                                    advancement of U.S. interests.</p>
                                <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> is
                                    charged with conducting the trade negotiations and related trade
                                    matters. The success of these negotiations, given their scope
                                    and implications for the future, is of the highest importance.
                                    Since many aspects of policy for which each of you has some
                                    responsibility bear on our trade relations and hence the trade
                                    negotiations, it is particularly important that these activities

                                <p>There is no longer a separate wool textile industry. Most US
                                    textile companies manufacture all fibers including cotton, wool
                                    and synthetics. The ten largest textile companies, which are the
                                    moving force in pressing for wool textile protection, are
                                    primarily cotton textile manufacturers. Half of their activities
                                    consists in manufacturing cotton textiles. Another third
                                    consists of the production of textiles from man-made fibers.
                                    Wool textile manufacture is only a small part of their total
                                    activities.</p>
                                <p>These are the companies that have been the major beneficiaries of
                                    the Cotton Textile Agreement that we negotiated at
                                Geneva.</p></item>

                                    previous years. Burlington, the largest company in the industry,
                                    became the industry's first billion-dollar company in 1962. Net
                                    earnings after taxes increased substantially in 1962 and

                            We have a commitment to the industry, but we could carry it out only at
                            enormous cost to other U.S. interests, especially the general trade
                            negotiations. He sketched the history of our effort since August. The
                            wool study group met to explore the possibility of an international
                            agreement. The major exporters concerned are the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, Japan and Italy. However, the situation is quite
                            different from that in cotton textiles, in which the major
                            industrialized countries shared our interests, and in which we were able
                            to compensate the underdeveloped countries by opening up European
                            markets to them somewhat. Therefore, the need for some “sweetener” was
                            recognized and it was suggested that we combine a quota arrangement with
                            a cut in raw wool <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0599"/>tariff. There
                            were discussions between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2"
                                >Blumenthal</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WWE1">Eric Wyndham
                                White</persName>, after which Wyndham White conducted exploratory
                            talks in Europe. He received a loud and uniformly unfavorable response.
                            It was the Department's conclusions that (1) no agreement was feasible;
                            (2) unilateral quotas would lead to large demands for compensation and
                            great interference with the trade negotiations; and (3) a probable
                            Japanese withdrawal from the cotton textile agreement,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d266fn2"><ref target="#d242">Document 242</ref>.</note>
                            which would kill that agreement. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> noted that the cotton textile agreement was
                            achieved without any compensation. Further, the same firms were involved
                            to a substantial extent in cotton and wool, and the cotton textile
                            agreement was worth much more to them than any wool textile agreement
                            would be, if in fact it were achieved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked whether we
                            could settle on the present or slightly higher level of imports and the
                            President thought this might be a good idea. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the exporters chiefly
                            concerned, viewed this as an important item and they would not be
                            satisfied. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> quoted
                            Senator Pastore to the effect that any quota arrangement, even if it
                            increased the permissible level of imports to 25 percent, was
                            worthwhile. There remained the possibility of combining this with
                            reduced tariffs on both wool and cotton textiles. The counter argument
                            to this was purely emotional.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> disagreed. There
                            was a very strong negative reaction in Europe to the threat of quotas.
                            He has had many discussions with the Community and with Heath, Errol and
                            Maudling in England, and indirectly with the Japanese. Every country he
                            has approached showed strong negative reactions, and expressed the view
                            that any quota proposals were inconsistent with our desire to make
                            progress on the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> round.
                            Further, such proposals would raise large demands for compensation.</p>
                        <p>The President, however, thought that a limitation on future growth was
                            much easier for other countries to accept than a rollback. He contrasted
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>'s proposal<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d266fn3">Not further identified, but See <ref target="#d262"

                            glass. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> responded
                            that the wool industry just has not been hurt, and that in this respect
                            the situation differed sharply.</p>
                        <p>The President raised some question about the method of computing the
                            level of imports, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>
                            indicated that this was not an issue. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> showed a list of woolen
                            manufacturers that had failed, and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> pointed out that a private study of failing woolen
                            manufacturers showed that imports were irrelevant to failure in 16 out
                            of 18 cases examined.</p>
                        <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0600"/>
                        <p>The President observed that, if he had made no commitment, there would be
                            absolutely no doubt in his mind as to what he would do, but since he had
                            made the commitment, we should try our best to meet it. The question
                            was: Should we try to sell Feldman's proposal?</p>
                        <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>'s
                            question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said that
                            the proposal would satisfy both Senator Pastore and the New England wool
                            industry. The President again asked whether we could sell the proposal.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> pointed out that
                            as far as the tariff part of it was concerned, the regular procedure
                            involved hearings by the Tariff Commission, etc., and would take about
                            six months. The quota problem would have to be treated separately, and
                            he doubted that there was a legal basis for imposing a quota. The only
                            one available was a Tariff Commission finding of injury to the industry,
                            which he was confident would not be made.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion of the significance of the legal problem, it was
                            agreed that, while there was a technical barrier, it was not
                            substantively important. Either new legislation could be passed, which
                            could be done readily, or the cotton textile agreement could be amended
                            to include woolens. Here, however, the problem arose as to whether or
                            not such an attempt would blow up the cotton textile agreement.</p>
                        <p>The President again repeated that it was unfortunate that he had made the
                            commitment and asked again how we could make it effective. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> observed that if we rule
                            out the finding of a threat to national security, he was doubtful that
                            we could meet any agreement on anything worthwhile. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> went over the history of the
                            cotton textile agreement, and the market disruption theory on which it
                            was based, and pointed out again there was no comparable situation in
                            wool, no comparable line-up of interests, in which we and the other
                            industrialized countries face a common problem. Further, there were now
                            no quota restrictions on trade in industrial products among the major
                            industrialized countries. This was the result of a long and consistent
                            effort on our part, and an attempt to introduce quotas on woolen goods
                            would undo this effort. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> remarked that the inability of the industry to show
                            injury made our bargaining position very weak. In response to a renewed
                            question by the President, Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> said that he thought any effort to do more than
                            we had done would have undesirable results. First of all, the cotton
                            textile agreement would break up. Then we would be faced with a
                            breakdown of our whole trade negotiation position and no possibility of
                            maintaining our agricultural exports to Europe. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> suggested that it might be
                            possible in the context of the general <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> round negotiations next year to treat wool as a
                            special case and get some protection for it. This would have the
                            advantage of merging the compensation problem with the general
                            compensation problem in the broader framework. To isolate wool textiles
                            in <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0601"/>advance would simply not be
                            useful. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> endorsed
                            that suggestion as being hopeful. In response to the President's
                            question of why we could not do wool first, Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> repeated his doubts that we
                            could achieve an agreement even with a great effort, as well as pointing
                            out the probable adverse effects on our whole negotiating position, by
                            undermining the philosophy of our trade policy.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked what he should say to Senator Pastore, and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> asked what Governor
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> should say to the
                            industry committee tomorrow. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> suggested that our response should contain two
                            elements. First, we should show that we have made an enormous effort to
                            meet the commitment, and explain in detail what it has been. Second, we
                            should point out that next year, in the context of the over-all trade
                            negotiations, there is some prospect for success in achieving something
                            for woolens. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> suggested
                            that it might also be useful to ask Wyndham White to come here to give
                            the industry his assessment of the situation directly. Mr. Donahue urged
                            that some feasible interim action be taken, if only another effort to
                            negotiate through Wyndham White. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> agreed that a further effort to show good faith
                            was useful. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            pointed out that we had already done as much as possible through
                                <persName corresp="#p_WLC1">White</persName>, and that another round
                            of failures would do us no good; we must not be in the position of
                            mendicants. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> suggested
                            that it might be useful to have <persName corresp="#p_WLC1"
                                >White</persName> come in any event, and give the industry the
                            notion that we are waiting for a final judgment on his discussion with
                            them. He suggested Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> say this to the textile group tomorrow. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> pointed out the great
                            change in the international atmosphere since the commitment was made:
                            failure of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to get into the Common
                            Market, and our present difficulties with the French. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName>, in response to a question
                            from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, explained to
                            the President that two separate efforts had been made in the past.
                            First, he personally had led a delegation of twenty industry and fifteen
                            government people to London, and achieved total failure.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question as to what industry wanted,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said an <gloss
                                target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss> determination that quotas were
                            justified on national security grounds. If this were done, the
                            combination of compensation and retaliation that would ensue would leave
                            us helpless to do anything on the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> round. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> added that since no one would believe that national
                            security was involved, it would undercut the whole basis of our position
                            with respect to trade negotiations. The President agreed that the
                            national security argument was weak. He thought, however, it might be
                            useful to hold out some form of hope to the industry tomorrow; to point
                            out what we have done and what perhaps can be done next year; and to
                            indicate that we are watching the situation now.</p>
                        <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>There was some discussion of the techniques of breaking the bad news, and
                            it was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>
                            would produce a memorandum for the use of all involved which would
                            summarize both the efforts we have made and what we might do. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that we warn
                            the governments concerned quietly that a further sharp increase in wool
                            imports next year might prove troublesome to us in the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> round negotiations. It was
                            agreed that such a warning might be useful.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized the main points to be covered by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> as follows: A detailed account
                            of our efforts to meet the commitment, an explanation of the new
                            situation that has arisen in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> since the commitment was made,
                            and its effect on our ability to negotiate, the difficulties in
                            negotiating a woolen agreement now in relation to the risk of failure of
                            the cotton agreement, the fact that we are watching and have warned the
                            governments concerned, and, finally, the possibility of achieving some
                            relief in the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> round
                            negotiations.</p>

                                >Rusk</persName> and I have each strongly pressed the case for
                            poultry exports with Chiefs of State, Foreign and Economic Ministers,
                            and other high-level officials of the European governments concerned.
                            Our Missions abroad, acting under strong instructions from Washington,
                            have sought every opportunity to try to promote a satisfactory solution,
                            from the point of view of American poultry interests.</p>
                        <p>These efforts have been closely coordinated with parallel efforts by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_FOL1">Freeman</persName> and the
                            Department of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>In spite of all this, I am sorry to report that we can so far report only
                            very limited success. The <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> has now
                            undertaken to re-examine the application and scale of certain of the
                            charges applied to poultry imports. To prepare for the review, the
                            United States Government and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            officials recently met in Brussels for a detailed examination of the
                            technical issues. It is likely that the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> Commission will recommend certain changes favorable to
                            imports. We expect the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council of
                            Ministers to consider these questions early this month. Action in the
                                <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council will, however, require
                            unanimity, and there is reason to fear that at least one member state of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> may object to modifications of
                            the import system for poultry.</p>
                        <p>United States exports of poultry to the Federal Republic of Germany (our
                            major market in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>) have seriously
                            declined since last August, but they have not yet been reduced “to
                            nearly nothing”, as your letter suggests. Our total exports of poultry
                            to the Federal Republic increased from 137.7 million pounds in 1961 to
                            152.3 million in 1962. Of the 1962 figure, 38.5 million pounds were
                            shipped to Germany during the last five months of 1962 when the common
                            agricultural policy for poultry was in effect. Also, as of August 1,
                            1962, (the effective date of the common agricultural policy), stocks of
                            poultry in Germany amounted to some 88.2 million pounds. The existence
                            of these stocks undoubtedly contributed to the decline in US exports in
                            the past several months.</p>
                        <p>I am under no illusions, however, as to the disastrous effect of these
                            greatly increased import charges if they are not promptly revised. They
                            will make it difficult or impossible for US poultry exporters to compete
                            with <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> poultry producers. We are,
                            therefore, planning to make use of every practicable measure to secure
                            their reduction. If the present line of effort does not succeed, we
                            shall try to find a solution through the forthcoming negotiations under
                            the Trade Expansion Act.</p>
                        <p>I am sending a similar letter to Senators Magnuson and Jackson.</p>

                        <p>The points of that program and the performance are as follows:</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Performance</hi>. New and much more favorable
                            depreciation schedules were promulgated in October, 1961.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Performance</hi>. Such arrangements have been provided
                            under the Trade Expansion Act.</p>

                                undue disruption of established industries.”</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Performance</hi>. The State Department was able to
                            negotiate, first, a Short-Term and, then, a Long-Term World Cotton
                            Textile Agreement that has checked the flow of cotton textile imports
                            and effectively prevented market disruption. With the exception of the
                            Japanese voluntary arrangements, no previous administration had ever
                            provided quantitative limitations on textile imports before. The World
                            Cotton Textile Agreement is, in fact, without precedent for any
                            industrial product, and it was achieved without having to penalize other
                            US industries through the payment of any compensation. Many wool textile
                            companies have greatly benefitted by this agreement since they are also
                            producers of cotton textiles.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">SECOND ASSERTION:</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Administration has not seriously tried to negotiate
                                a wool textile agreement.</hi></p>
                        <p>This is just not true.</p>
                        <p>By the use of great pressure we convened a meeting in London last
                            December of all countries interested in the wool textile trade.</p>
                        <p>During that meeting we urged a solution to the United States textile
                            problem. Our efforts met a completely negative reception.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter we undertook—utilizing the good offices of the Executive
                            Secretary of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, Mr. Wyndham
                            White—to work out a voluntary arrangement with the exporting countries.
                            Again, the reaction was uniformly adverse.</p>
                        <p>We have gone far enough to recognize the impossibility of obtaining a
                            negotiated agreement. To restrict wool textile imports by unilateral
                            action would result in prohibitive costs in compensation; would, quite
                            likely, bring down the entire structure of cotton textile production;
                            and would poison the international atmosphere for the forthcoming trade
                            negotiations under the Trade Expansion Act.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> called me tonight to
                            discuss the possible steps that the Administration might take in order
                            to show some further effort toward meeting the import problem of the
                            woolen textile industry. I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> I thought that the Administration had already
                            developed a very creditable record of action on behalf of the textile
                            industry. I have pointed out the extent and character of this action in
                            another memorandum I have just sent you.<note n="1" xml:id="d269fn1"
                                    ><ref target="#d268">Document 268</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> and I agreed, however,
                            that we would take one further step. This would consist of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> calling in the
                            ambassadors of the principal woolen textile importing
                            countries—principally the United Kingdom and Italy. On careful
                            reflection I strongly advise against calling in the Japanese Ambassador
                            in view of the fact that the Japanese Government has told us that it is
                            planning to challenge our method of administering the Cotton Textile
                            Agreement in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. We have too much
                            riding on that agreement to put it in jeopardy by a Japanese
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> would say to the
                            ambassadors that the Administration is under great pressure from the
                            woolen textile industry who are feeling the effects of a sharp rise in
                            wool textile imports. This pressure could become so severe as to compel
                            restrictive action.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the principal exporting nations have already
                            made emphatically clear that they reject a multilateral agreement for
                            wool textiles, the Secretary would suggest that they help to ease the
                            domestic pressure in the United States by advising their industries to
                            show restraint in the buildup of the volume of their exports.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this course of action with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, and he concurs.</p>
                        <p>I am under no illusion that this will satisfy the wool textile industry
                            or that it will have a serious effect on imports. But it is the most we
                            dare do under all the circumstances.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>I met with Senators Pastore, MUSKIE, McGee, Talmadge, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>, and Church at 5 o'clock
                            yesterday. They expressed their disappointment with the meeting held
                            between Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and
                            representatives of the wool industry, and we discussed in general terms
                            the problems of the industry.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the meeting, Senator Pastore asked that Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> call in the Ambassadors
                            from the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan and seek an agreement with
                            them for quantitative limitations upon the imports of wool textiles.</p>
                        <p>I have asked Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            for his reaction to this suggestion. He strongly recommends against any
                            attempt to negotiate with these nations. He does, however, believe it
                            feasible to have Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            call in the various Ambassadors, explain to them the pressures from the
                            wool textile industry, and suggest to them that they do whatever is
                            possible to obtain the consent of their wool textile industries to a
                            limitation upon exports to the United States. He is confident that it is
                            not possible to reach any firm agreement on any terms, and an effort to
                            do so will result in a loss of prestige to the United States.</p>
                        <p>You might also tell Senator Pastore that we are instructing our
                            Ambassadors abroad to make similar representations to the governments to
                            which they are accredited.</p>

                            <item>The leverage of the Five over France is that the French need
                                certain actions that can only be taken by the agreement of the whole

                            <item>At present, the French are saying to the Five: “If you don't give
                                us what we want with respect to these matters, we shall see to it
                                that there is no Kennedy Round.” Our problem in the next few weeks
                                is to work with the Five to use these French demands to extract a
                                French agreement. We must persuade the Five to say to the French:
                                “Unless you agree to full participation in the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round, you will not receive

                            <item>The leverage of the Five is, however, a wasting asset. We must
                                encourage the Five—especially Italy and The Netherlands—to use their
                                bargaining power with France now. They will be less able to hold out
                                against de Gaulle in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> as time
                                passes, since each country desires to make progress on <gloss

                            <item>It is unrealistic to expect that France can be pinned down now on
                                all the details of the Kennedy Round. At the same time, a simple
                                agreement “in principle” will not be enough. We must try to extract
                                commitments that are as specific as possible, on such crucial points
                                as the undertaking of substantial linear tariff reductions and the

                        <p>I have been giving hard thought to the question of how we got into the
                            wool textile predicament. Leaving aside questions of substance, I think
                            there may be lessons in procedure to be learned by all of us who had a
                            part in putting you in an awkward situation.</p>
                        <p>This requires a brief analysis of the manner in which the relevant
                            decisions were made.</p>

                        <p>Until August 7, 1962, the Administration had given no firm promise to
                            either the wool textile industry or to the Congressmen and Senators
                            interested in that industry. The Seven-Point Textile Program of May 2,
                                1961,<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">See <ref target="#d213">Document
                                    213</ref>.</note> provided merely that the Department of State
                            would call a conference to “seek an international understanding which
                            will provide a basis for trade that will avoid undue disruption of
                            established industries.” Thereafter—over the strenuous objections of the
                            industry, which wished to present a massive united front to the
                            Administration—I insisted upon treating separately with the cotton
                            textile producers and the producers of wool and man-made fiber textiles.
                            All that we ever promised the wool textile producers was that we would
                            keep their situation under careful study and observation.</p>
                        <p>Early in May, 1962, the Cabinet Textile Committee<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d272fn3">At the urging of Secretary of Commerce <persName

                                to study the textile problem. Established February 16, 1961, the

                                as chairman, Secretary of the Treasury <persName corresp="#p_DCD1"

                                Under Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName>.</note> appointed a subcommittee to examine what
                            should be done with regard to wool textile imports. (At that time,
                            imports were not sharply rising although the industry was putting on
                            incessant pressure.) This Committee recommended that we utilize the
                            International Wool Study Group as a forum for exploring this problem on
                            an international basis and as a means for relieving industry
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>I had hoped that the problem could be left to rest on this basis.
                            Nevertheless, I took great pains on several occasions to advise the
                            Cabinet <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0612"/>Textile Committee that
                            the international situation of wool textiles was totally different from
                            that of cotton and that I did not see how a wool textile commitment
                            could ever be fulfilled if one were made.</p>
                        <p>On July 16, 1962, the National Association of Woolen Textile
                            Manufacturers called attention to a resolution of the Board of Directors
                            of the Association demanding mandatory quotas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> prepared a draft reply
                            to the Association's letter that would have committed the Administration
                            to hold woolen textile imports to the fiscal year 1961 level. He
                            discussed this matter over the telephone with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> of the State Department, who
                            was then in New York in the midst of the Coffee Agreement negotiation.
                            There is a discrepancy in the recollection of this conversation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> believes that after
                            considerable discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2"
                                >Blumenthal</persName> acquiesced in the language that was finally
                            incorporated in the reply that was sent on August 7. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> is equally clear that he
                            recommended innocuous language, warned about the implications of a
                            specific commitment and—although told by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> that the White House had decided a stronger
                            commitment was needed—ended the conversation under the impression that
                            he had made his point with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> and that no specific commitment would be
                            given.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, this was a case of honest misunderstanding on both sides. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> did not call me
                            immediately because he believed the matter was in hand. He felt he had
                            prevented the making of a specific commitment and so reported to me on
                            his return to Washington the following week. I was, of course, aware
                            that during this period Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> was under strong pressure from the industry and
                            from Congress and that his position was not an easy one.</p>
                        <p>As sent, the letter of August 7 contained the following commitment:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"Limitation of textile imports to prevent market disruption is an

                                    implement this policy with regard to all textiles, and
                                    particularly to prevent market disruption such as would result
                                    from an increase over current levels of import.”</p>

                        <p>When this language came to our attention several days later, I requested
                            a meeting with you which was held on August 20, 1962. In the course of
                            that meeting, we reviewed both the cotton and wool problems, and some of
                            the difficulties involved in a wool commitment were pointed out.</p>
                        <p>A larger meeting was held with you on the following day (August 21). Just
                            prior to that meeting, I sent you two memoranda which were discussed
                            during the course of the August 21 meeting. One was a memorandum
                            entitled “Present State of the Textile Import Problem.”<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d272fn4"><ref target="#d249">Document 249</ref>.</note>

                            which is attached as Tab B.</p>
                        <p>The meeting on August 21 was attended by Mr. Sorensen (since Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> was at that time
                            abroad), as well as by the Secretary of Commerce and (I believe) Larry
                            O'Brien. In the course of that meeting—held in the Cabinet Room—we
                            discussed the arguments contained in the memorandum at Tab A regarding
                            the non-negotiability of a multilateral woolen textile agreement. It was
                            also pointed out that any non-negotiated quota arrangements would
                            involve heavy compensation.</p>
                        <p>The meeting was dominated, however, by the strong feeling that we had to
                            do something substantial for the wool textile interests in order to keep
                            their support for the Trade Expansion Act. There was considerable
                            discussion as to the meaning of the expression “current levels” in the

                            15 percent figure which the industry was pressing. It was generally
                            agreed that a figure something over 17 percent was defensible under the
                            August 7 language.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the meeting, the State Department was pressed very hard
                            to undertake negotiations. I explained again that a multilateral
                            agreement was not possible. However, in view of the need for some
                            action, it was agreed that—after all accessions to the Cotton Textile
                            Agreement had been obtained—we would undertake some exploratory
                            discussions.</p>

                            two other Senators on August 24 and that you met with a larger group on
                            August 30. As you know, I do not recall being present at either
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>Just prior to the August 30 meeting, you telephoned me in New York to say
                            that you were meeting in five minutes with a group of Senators on the
                            textile problem. We quickly reviewed the pending cotton textile
                            questions. When we reached wool textiles, I remember telling you that

                            commitment, I would do my best to see what solution could be
                            found—although I could not say what might be feasible.</p>

                            informing him that despite serious problems confronting US wool textile
                            industry and domestic political pressures, President had decided not
                            take action re wool textile imports at this time. This reflects
                            President's determination that we proceed toward trade liberalization
                            pursuant to Trade Expansion Act. In order wool textile import problem
                            not interfere with preparations for trade negotiations, Secretary
                            pointed out it would be helpful if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            might use its influence with its industry to prevent any substantial

                            not represent a change in US economic philosophy but was designed deal
                            with an immediate domestic problem. Also made clear he not suggesting

                            precedent. By blood, sweat, and arm-twisting we achieved an agreement to
                            which twenty-one countries have acceded. (Two others may accede soon.)
                            Had we resorted to mandatory unilateral quotas—for which the industry
                            was clamoring—the United States would have incurred compensation claims
                            on a quarter billion dollars of trade—and have been the net loser in the
                            economic war that would almost certainly have followed.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that the intelligent leaders of the textile industry know
                            they have gotten a good deal—but gratitude does not come easily and
                            their teeth grow longer with each success. Before he died, Spencer Love
                            of Burlington Mills wrote me a letter of thanks for the Geneva
                            negotiations, but the gesture was not characteristic of the
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that when we first undertook the Geneva negotiations,
                            industry spokesmen were prophesying imminent doom unless imports were
                            checked. Mr. Stevens himself told me that the cotton textile industry
                            would “be destroyed” if we could not find a means to stop the growth of
                            imports. Last September Mr. Seabury Stanton, Chairman of the Northern
                            Textile Association, estimated that, without the Geneva arrangements,
                            imports would by then have reached double the present levels. A current
                            article in <hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi><note n="1" xml:id="d274fn1">
                                Richard J. Whalen, “The Durable Threads of J.P. Stevens,” Fortune,
                                April 1963, pp. 110-176.</note> suggests that the figure might well
                            have been three times current levels.</p>
                        <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0617"/>
                        <p>Interestingly enough the <hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi> article implies
                            that the industry engaged in a certain deliberate overstatement of its
                            predicament. It quotes Kenneth Fraser, the Financial Vice President of
                            J. P. Stevens, as saying: “The stress so many of us put on imports has
                            had a depressing effect on textiles and hasn't helped us with the
                            financial community. But it was a calculated risk; we finally got
                            Washington to do something.”</p>
                        <p>The Geneva arrangements put an effective brake on imports. The textile
                            industry knows that it will not again be faced by a sudden and
                            disruptive tide of imported cotton goods, such as occurred during the
                            four years preceding 1961 when imports rose from 2 to 6% of
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>We imported $700,000 worth of cotton textiles from Hong Kong in 1956. In
                            1960—the year preceding the Geneva negotiations—our imports from Hong
                            Kong totalled $64 million. The United States will not tolerate another
                            Hong Kong situation in cotton textiles. This has been said clearly and
                            firmly to foreign governments. They understand this and have reluctantly
                            accepted it.</p>
                        <p>But by the same token we cannot afford to disregard the spirit in which
                            we were able to secure agreement to the Geneva arrangements. To date,
                            twenty-one Governments have been persuaded to participate on the
                            understanding that importing nations would request restraints on imports
                            only when those imports threatened disruption of the market for specific
                            categories of textile products.</p>
                        <p>The arrangement is not a license for us to act arbitrarily and we shall
                            be in trouble if we do. Under the terms of the agreement any government
                            may withdraw on 60 days' notice. If any major producing country were to
                            pull out, the whole structure would come tumbling down. In that event,
                            our domestic industry would be left without protection, even from
                            disruptive imports—unless the Administration were prepared to assume the
                            fantastic costs of imposing unilateral import quotas.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, essential that we administer the agreement with
                            sensitivity to the reactions of the other members—which means that we
                            can't press any harder than we are already doing.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Relation of Current Level of Imports to Domestic
                            Consumption</p>
                        <p>But, in spite of this, I see no reason why our cotton textile industry
                            should not live happily and prosperously under these arrangements. A
                            little slippage from the 6% should not be cause for alarm. After all,
                            many textile companies (including J. P. Stevens) had their highest sales
                            in history in 1962.</p>
                        <p>The passage of legislation to eliminate discrimination resulting from the
                            two-price system for cotton would be another major benefit provided by
                            your Administration to the textile industry. Half of our <pb n="592"
                                xml:id="pg_592" facs="0618"/>imports of cotton textiles are
                            presently affected by the two-price system. <hi rend="italic"
                                >Elimination of this discriminatory system should greatly relieve
                                the pressure of imports—and make the 6% level much more
                                realistic</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, I hope that the industry will stop watching the monthly
                            figures and look at the longer-term trends. The 6% figure makes sense
                            only if regarded as an average over the five-year term of the Geneva
                            arrangements. While domestic sales were slightly off during the early
                            months of this year because purchasers were hoping—no doubt
                            mistakenly—that the elimination of the two-price system would be
                            reflected in some decrease in textile prices, imports fluctuated widely.
                            In January, they were at the lowest point in over a year because of the
                            dock strike; in February, they were double the previous months.</p>
                        <p>Whether at the level of 6% or 7% or 7.2%, cotton textile imports are not
                            building appreciably. In fact, in dollar value they are not much higher
                            than exports. A little more concentration on developing exports would
                            not only be good for the industry, but help our balance of payments.</p>
                        <p>After all, if the domestic industry feels put upon, it should compare its
                            fate with that of the British textile mills. U.K. imports have risen to
                            over 40% of domestic production as the result of a systematic
                            rationalization of the industry coupled with a deliberate government
                            policy to assist the less-developed areas in the Commonwealth. And the
                            total British economy has benefitted by the release of skilled labor
                            into the electronics industry.</p>
                        <p>In connection with our conversations with the textile industry you may
                            get some comfort from Sherman Adams' report of a colloquy between
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and George
                            Humphrey. Adams writes: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Our objective for the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Ministerial
                            May 16 is a firm decision to begin tariff negotiations in the Spring of
                            1964 on the basis of these principles.</p>
                        <p>The French are the principal problem. They have not yet shown their hand
                            and apparently want to avoid being isolated as they were in January. But
                            they are doing everything they can to throw road-blocks in the way of a
                            rapid decision on the kind of negotiations we want. However, the other
                            Five are apparently ready to use their considerable bargaining power on
                            internal Common Market issues to bring the French along.</p>
                        <p>Our strategy is to keep the pressure on the Community for a basic E.E.C.
                            commitment at the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Ministerial this
                            Spring; and to work with the E.E.C. Commission (which negotiates for the
                            Common Market in <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>) and with the
                            Five to keep the pressure on the French. This strategy has been
                            successful to date despite a French effort to divert attention from the
                            central issue by emphasizing the fact that the United States tariff has
                            more high rates than the Community tariff. But any sign we were wavering
                            on the eve of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Ministerial
                            could weaken the common front of the Commission and the Five and help
                            the French forestall a clear-cut decision by the Council of
                            Ministers.</p>

                        <p>The President met in his office on May 2 at 10:30 with Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRE2">Robert Marjolin</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RJ8">Jean Rey</persName> of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> Commission. They were accompanied by Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. After an exchange of greetings
                            the President opened the discussion by observing that the Trade
                            Expansion Act had represented a fairly radical step. It was a departure
                            from our past method of doing things and it had taken a great deal of
                            effort to persuade Congress that this was a worthwhile thing to do. The
                            President realized we all would have particular problems with applying
                            this method but he hoped for sufficient give and take on both sides so
                            we could have a successful and beneficial negotiation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> agreed that the principles of
                            the Act were good and that we would make something out of it. There were
                            important problems of detail that remained to be dealt with but he was
                            confident that they could be dealt with successfully. The President
                            remarked on the importance of unanimity among the Six in their approach
                            to the problem and hoped that there could be unanimity. He thought on
                            both sides we should commit ourselves to as large-scale reductions as
                            possible and be prepared to face the domestic complaints as they arose.
                            He observed that it was a curious fact that harm <pb n="596"
                                xml:id="pg_596" facs="0622"/>to business that arose from domestic
                            competition was more or less accepted while harm from import competition
                            was viewed as something that had to be defended against. This, of
                            course, was contrary to the economic logic of competition. On our own
                            part, we are prepared to go as far as our legal authority allows in the
                            trade negotiations. We have made that position clear; the President said
                            he knew that Chris Herter would not have accepted the appointment if he
                            was not convinced that we were prepared to go to the limit of our power
                            in this negotiation. Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_RJ8"
                                >Rey</persName> observed that there had been very good cooperation
                            between the U.S. and the Commission. This was true at the level of
                            relations between the Commissioner and Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> and it was true at the working
                            level. The Commission staff had lively discussions with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWM2">Blumenthal</persName> and technical discussions
                            were going ahead well.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to the question of the international monetary
                            mechanism and whether it was equal to the needs of world trade. He
                            observed that he had just received the other day a minister from Guinea.
                            Like most of the less-developed countries Guinea was practically
                            bankrupt. In fact Latin America, Africa, and Asia were essentially in
                            this position and the U.S. balance of payments position was poor as
                            well. This raised the question of whether too many countries were
                            striving after surplus and whether this was not dangerous. Was not the
                            West as a whole in danger of letting money master national purposes
                            instead of letting broader purposes determine the monetary
                            mechanism?</p>
                        <p>Commissioner <persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> responded
                            that the surplus of the Six was declining. Their trade balance was
                            moving toward a better equilibrium than that of the U.S. Wages in these
                            countries were rising some ten per cent per year and this rate of rise
                            was still continuing in France, Germany and Italy and perhaps to only a
                            slightly less extent in Holland. M. Marjolin expressed his confidence
                            that in two years or so more the dollar will be in a sound position.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed that so far as trade went, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName>'s observations were sound. On
                            the other hand, one had to look not only to trade but other items. We
                            expected our net loss on tourist account alone to be $1.5 billion next
                            year. When the military burdens were considered, in addition, it was
                            clear that we had to earn a bigger trade surplus to account for them. He
                            did not mention investment because this was something he thought we
                            ourselves had to deal with. In these balance of payments matters our
                            loss was Europe's gain. Everybody can't have a surplus, yet if the U.S.
                            responded by taking restrictive measures this could bring in Europe and
                            the rest of the world the kind of desperate situation we had in the 20's
                            and 30's, which would be disastrous.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> responded that Europe was
                            not fighting to keep its surplus. It did not want a deficit indeed, but
                            that is as far as it went. The U.S. basic deficit including short-term
                            capital movements was not so big. In <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597"
                                facs="0623"/>the face of rate of expansion, of demand in the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, the increasingly good economic
                            conditions in the U.S., and the effect they would have on capital
                            movements, <persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> was confident
                            the problem would be met. However, he agreed with the President that the
                            international monetary system needed reform. The gold exchange standard
                            was a fragile mechanism and it could not withstand any serious shock.
                            While he was not an outright advocate of Triffin, he thought there was a
                            good deal of merit in Triffin's ideas. He admired the accomplishments of
                            Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RRV1">Roosa</persName> in defending the dollar, but he
                            thought we must go beyond what they have done. It is clear that we must
                            have a situation in which the monetary system is the servant of the
                            economy and not vice versa.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the question of trade as a means toward other
                            goals. For us it clearly had to earn enough for tourists and defense. It
                            cost us about $3.5 billion annually on balance of payments account. M.
                            Rey asked whether U.S. investment in Europe should be stopped. The
                            President responded that he would be glad to see the Europeans do it.
                            D'Estaing has threatened several times to do this and the President
                            rather wondered when he would. <persName corresp="#p_MRE2"
                                >Marjolin</persName> warned the President not to count on d'Estaing
                            doing it and <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName> added that the
                            Commission would not do it.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what the present state of the poultry problem was and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRE2">Marjolin</persName> referred to the
                            Commission proposal of the Council of Ministers and described it as a
                            good proposal for which the Commission would have to fight hard. The
                            President responded that he would describe it as at best a moderately
                            good proposal. He thought that the Europeans would by now be willing to
                            do what we asked in respect to poultry in order that they would not have
                            to listen to us talk about it any more.</p>
                        <p>There was a certain amount of further discussion of poultry and the
                            conversation turned to the Italian elections. The President indicated
                            that he thought that they might have no effect on the Community but
                            feared they might have some effect on <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>With your permission, and at your pleasure, may I return to the subject
                            of the relation between our balance of payments position and what we
                            seek in the trade negotiations? If you have already had enough, stop
                            here.</p>
                        <p>Your discussion with Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_MRE2"
                                >Marjolin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RJ8">Rey</persName>
                            of why we need to increase our already large trade surplus further in
                            order to meet our military and tourist outlays (among others) was clear,
                            and from our point of view, convincing. We are providing Europe both
                            with income that does not register in the trade account, e.g., tourists
                            and investments, and with military services which we pay for and they do
                            not, and the benefits of aid expenditures for which we still pay a
                            disproportionate share. It is the fact that we must either finance these
                            outlays by our trade surplus or reduce them. The Europeans should
                            understand this, and it should affect their attitude toward the trade
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>However, despite all this, it may not be helpful to our negotiating
                            position to emphasize these truths. The negotiations under the Trade
                            Expansion Act are carried on by a Commission which must act under
                            instructions from six governments. The competence of the Commission is
                            essentially economic. In our dealings with it, our arguments and theirs
                            are couched in economic terms. The best argument we can make in these
                            terms in that successful trade negotiations, resulting in the greatest
                            possible reduction of barriers, are in the economic interests of both
                            the U.S. and Europe. It is easier to make this argument because the
                            negotiations involve not only the U.S. and the Six, but the rest of the
                            world as well.</p>
                        <p>An argument that goes further and speaks to the U.S. need for the trade
                            negotiations to result in a better balance of payments position for us,
                            and rests on broader political and military security grounds, may prove
                            too much. First, it would suggest that we are in a weak position and it
                            is so important for us to try to succeed that the Europeans can toughen
                            their bargaining terms. An analogy that may be helpful is the position
                            of a man selling a house. If he tells the prospective buyer that he is
                            in a tough financial shape and must get a very good price for the house,
                            it is as likely to weaken as to strengthen his bargaining position.</p>
                        <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0625"/>
                        <p>Further, such arguments by us may be used, especially by the French, to
                            support the view that we are seeking more from Europe in the trade
                            negotiations than we are willing to give. While we can put the
                            negotiations in their broader context, the Europeans in their
                            discussions with each other need not. The French are already making this
                            kind of argument in Europe, with some effect. Since the relations
                            between the French and the other five within the Commission are crucial
                            to the decisions that the Commission makes on the trade negotiations, we
                            do not want to provide them with what may look like evidence that the
                            French position is correct.</p>
                        <p>The same problem would arise in any discussion you might have with the
                            Finance or Economic Ministers of individual countries, since they, too,
                            would see the problem from their own viewpoint. The broader argument may
                            be appropriate with Foreign Ministers, or even more so with heads of
                            governments, who can instruct Finance Ministers and Economic Ministers
                            on the political values to Europe of a successful negotiation. Even with
                            them it is risky. In the narrower context of arguments about economic
                            benefits, it is decidedly two-edged, and seems to me as likely to work
                            against as for us in the bargaining process.</p>

                                there would be no reduction of any industrial rate which is 10
                                percent or less and even a 100 percent ad valorem rate would be
                                reduced by only 45 percent. On 25 percent ad valorem rate, reduction
                                would be only 30 percent. <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0627"

                                    brackets as well, rates under ecretement plan would be higher

                                plan based on unequal tariff reductions. Thus we consider basic plan
                                should provide for substantial equilinear reductions with minimum
                                exceptions. In course of negotiations on this basis, U.S. prepared

                                achieved by uneven reductions. Any country disadvantaged in exchange
                                of reductions should be entitled to appropriate credit. Depending on

                                    <ref target="#d275">See also Document 275</ref>.</note> I again
                            reviewed these questions with the President.</p>
                        <p>I told the President of the suggestion that the basis of tariff cuts
                            might be left open to be worked out over a period of months. His view is
                            that it is difficult for the United States Government to commit itself
                            to broad-scale negotiations and set the machinery of the Trade Expansion
                            Act in motion without having agreement with the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> regarding the general basis upon which the reduction of
                            tariffs is to take place. I myself feel that we should seek to reach an
                            agreement during the May Ministerial meeting regarding the nature of the
                            linear cut and the disposition of the tariff disparity problem. I am
                            confident that this can be worked out.</p>
                        <p>As I have emphasized to you in our several discussions of this subject,
                            we are conscious of the fact that in your view the problem of highs and
                                lows<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">Reference is to the ecretement
                                proposal; See <ref target="#d278">Document 278</ref>.</note> is one
                            that requires some attention. We agree that this is a matter which must
                            be examined. We are convinced that once we establish the principle of an
                            equilinear cut as the basis for negotiations we can then deal with the
                            question of highs and lows.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the rules for exceptions is, of course, an important
                            related problem that will require further discussions between us. I
                            think, nevertheless, that it would be possible to reach agreement at the
                            Ministerial meeting on the basic negotiating rule while leaving for
                            further discussion the precise rules that are to govern exceptions. I
                            say this assuming that we are agreed that the exception list in any case
                            must be very limited and subject to individual confrontation and
                            justification.</p>

                            atmosphere surrounding the forthcoming tariff negotiations<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d280fn1">Reference is to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                    >GATT</gloss> Ministerial meeting held May 16-22 in
                                Geneva.</note> was a matter of concern. He said that there was no
                            desire on the part of France to become protectionist. The French economy
                            had prospered greatly under the liberalization of the past four years.
                            The French welcomed liberalization not only within the Six but also in
                            relations between the Six and others. However, there might be trouble
                            with the formula proposed by the U.S. for these negotiations. The U.S.
                            formula was too rigid. The U.S. had high tariff peaks and the linear
                            reduction would disarm the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> while
                            certain U.S. commodities would remain protected. French experts believed
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> formula would be compatible with
                            U.S. legislation and that its employment would not require a new
                            authorization from Congress.</p>
                        <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>
                            formula would require commodity by commodity or sector by sector
                            negotiations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName>
                            said neither would be required. The formula called for a tariff on
                            finished products at 10 to 15 per cent, semi-finished products at 6 to
                            10 percent and a zero duty on raw materials within a certain period of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that he did
                            not wish to go further into the details of the proposal. If it was
                            necessary to go into details to remove misunderstandings, Messrs.
                            Wormser and Clappier could come here for such discussions. The point he
                            wished to stress was that a disagreement on the formula to be employed
                            should not be allowed to rekindle a political controversy. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> formula did not agree with ours this
                            did not mean that France wishes to destroy the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tyler asked why it was necessary to advance a new formula at this
                            stage. He noted that our formula made allowances for exceptions and for
                            discussions of tariff peaks. He said he feared that the proposal of an
                            alternative formula at this stage would be considered a political
                            maneuver and that there would be a political reaction here, particularly
                            in Congress.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that the
                            Trade Expansion Act was an important and beneficial piece of
                            legislation. It was, however, a U.S. law, and the other countries had
                            not been consulted. Mr. Tyler pointed out that the formula proposed
                            under the TEA had been known for a long time. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> proposal was compatible with U.S.
                            legislation. Also, the formula had been advanced originally not by the
                            French but by the Germans. He briefly explained how the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> proposals would work: As a first step,
                            the difference between the tariff goals in the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> formula and actual tariffs would be cut in half.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question by the Secretary, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that the zero duty applied
                            only to industrial raw materials, not to agricultural products. On
                            agriculture there should be a worldwide agreement. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> concluded his presentation by
                            reiterating that differences on method should be seen as what they are
                            and should not be allowed to give rise to a political controversy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would wish a briefing on this subject. He
                            noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had been
                            closely concerned with these problems. The Secretary said that the
                            balance of payment aspects must also be considered. For example, U.S.
                            tourists abroad contributed heavily to the balance of payments picture.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_AH9">Alphand</persName> said that from
                            a practical point of view it was clear that U.S. exports could not be
                            increased without a corresponding increase in European exports.</p>

                            the tariff negotiations would be “based upon a plan of substantial
                            linear tariff reductions with a bare minimum of exceptions,” reflecting
                            the U.S. view. At the same time, they declared that “in these cases

                            reductions will be based upon special rules of general and automatic

                                State in the Board of Trade, was the most sympathetic as well as the
                                most appropriate British official to contact to discuss restrictions
                                on wool products into the United States. Lyon added, “the United
                                Kingdom government would in all probability accept an invitation if
                                extended by the United States to meet and discuss with the United
                                States and others in an international meeting the subject of
                                restriction on imports of wool textile products into the United
                                States. I believe it is fair to say that the United Kingdom

                            unwilling to accept the State Department statement that it was
                            impossible to arrange an international agreement on wool like the
                            international agreement on cotton. From the letters written to you and
                            to Senator Pastore, it would appear that the United Kingdom would be

                            <item>There are minor steps that we are taking to reduce wool textile
                                imports. For instance, imports from the Virgin Islands will be
                                reduced to a fraction of their present volume for 1964. Reductions
                                in effect already will make the total about 6.5 million linear yards
                                for the last 9 months of 1963. They will be 2.8 million linear yards
                                for 1964.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>We will also give consideration to preventing the circumvention of the
                            tariff regulations by putting braid on the wool. The ad valorem tariff
                            on wool fabrics is between 50 percent and 100 percent. However, by
                            put-ting braid on the fabric it is reduced to 42.5 percent. To evade the
                            tariff, importers have the braid attached and then take it off after it
                            has been imported. Senators Saltonstall and <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> have introduced legislation to make the fabric
                            dutiable at the higher rate even when it has braid attached to it. I
                            believe we can support the legislation to close this loophole.</p>

                            imports into the Community. As it announced, the Council merely
                            instructed the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission “to renew

                            September. In sum: the Council itself took no decision to reduce the
                            present poultry restrictions; it did not give a useful negotiating
                            instruction to the Commission; it again procrastinated.</p>

                        <p>Childs: I have been looking a little bit into the retaliation on the
                            chickens and I was told by one of your admirers on the Hill that you
                            felt this was a very ill-advised course and counseled against it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Oh no, not at all. As a
                            matter of fact, I told the President the other day that I was all for
                            it.</p>

                        <p>Childs: I'm disappointed in you. What's the matter with you?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Well I think that at some
                            point…. I would hope that as a result of our getting into the business
                            of examining the withdrawal of concessions, that we can really pull the
                            Europeans back to a position where they are going to face this thing
                            rationally. They have really been…in a very irresponsible fashion here
                            and they have let their own lobbies dominate them. We are not going to
                            start a trade war. I think this thing is blown up out of proportion,
                            partly because there has been too much talk about it on this side, but
                            even more important because it has become a play between the Germans and
                            the French with two agricultural lobbies working at times against one
                            another and at times with one another. But what is going to happen, is
                            that these problems have to be faced at the political level and the
                            Europeans have really refused to face this at the political level; they
                            have left it at the level of secretaries of agriculture who are always
                            going to be…in a situation of this kind.</p>
                        <p>Childs: Don't you think it can become a trade war?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: No. I don't think so. In the
                            first place, we have no intention of letting it become a trade war and
                            the Europeans are not going to in my opinion, because they will have
                            enough responsibility once they get a little sense of shock. But you
                            know I would feel a little more concern about this if we hadn't been
                            through the…glass experience where the shoe was on the other foot, and
                            we were excoriated all over Europe for raising these rates even though
                            they went through…procedures.</p>
                        <p>Childs: And they retaliated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: And they retaliated. And
                            that was all right; that was part of the game. I hate to see this thing
                            go on a retaliation route because it makes no sense from the point of
                            view of commercial policy, but I think it is the only way we have of
                            bringing this matter to a decision at the political level and giving the
                            government a club to beat their agricultural lobbies over the head with
                            and for that reason, I think it is very important that from time to time
                            we take a tough line. And while the chickens are…is not a big item in
                            total trade, it is only at the most something like $50,000,000 and it is
                            probably a vanishing market anyway, because the Europeans are going to
                            acquire the same technology of producing chickens on an assembly line
                            basis as we are.</p>
                        <p>Childs: Well, of course, they are.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Nevertheless, I think it is
                            useful to have a confrontation at this point on an item which is at
                            least symbolic of what the larger problem is going to be. The European
                            market for the Department of Agriculture is extremely important and if
                            the European governments are going to let their price structure and
                            their regime of protection of agriculture be fixed at the level of the
                            most inefficient producer, which is the situation here that I think…for
                            a very bad time and we might as well face that now as later. The net
                            result of all this pulling and hauling is very likely to be that <pb
                                n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0639"/>this thing will be raised up to
                            the proper political level and I'm not sure we will save the poultry,
                            but I think we will have saved some other things.</p>
                        <p>Childs: Yes. They are now in a position, however, to take up a trade war
                            and this is what de Gaulle would like, don't you think?</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I think he might like it,
                            but the Germans would hate it. Their problem is this and I don't think
                            de Gaulle really wants it either. I think that he talks a kind of…game,
                            but there is a good deal of—particularly among the larger European
                            producers—there is a good deal of sense…liberal trading world and there
                            is always a latent French protectionism, but it is nothing like as
                            strong as it used to be and the Germans who are the real offenders in
                            many ways on the chicken side. The industrial Germans, of course, are by
                            definition liberal traders, so that the pressures in Germany are going
                            to be for a liberalization and they are going to want to avoid a trade
                            war. We've got to have a crisis here and this is a good point to have
                            it, I think. I would just as soon that it came now and sort it out. I
                            don't think it is going to have great consequences but I do think it is
                            going to act as a kind of restraint on the lobbies and what it is going
                            to mean is that governments are going to look at these things
                            politically at the right political level sooner than they might
                            otherwise and not just leave them to the level of Ministers of
                            Agriculture, Secretaries of Commerce and what not.</p>
                        <p>Childs: Yes. Well, of course, I know it is…these farm lobbies are so
                            powerful everywhere, including here.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: That's all right.</p>
                        <p>Childs: Now the thing that Freeman has been lobbying around up there on
                            the Hill about this. He got up that telegram…53 Senators.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d285fn1">Not further identified.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Yes. I think, but then again
                            I mean he's just being the counterweight to the Ministers of Agriculture
                            in Europe. Up to this point, this has been a case where the lobby on one
                            side has been against the lobbies—combined lobbies—on the other, and I
                            think the time has got to come when this thing has to be settled by the
                            political leaders—the governments, because you can't have a commercial
                            policy problem these days in this kind of interdependent world that
                            doesn't become a political problem when big nations are involved. This
                            just has to be looked at as a political problem.</p>
                        <p>Childs: You know I saw your friend Jean Monnet in June and I have never
                            seen him, George—I have seen him many times—I have never seen him so
                            agitated. I brought up the chickens, chickens, chickens.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I know.</p>
                        <p>Childs: He is usually so calm.</p>
                        <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0640"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: He sees the chickens as
                            creating a source of friction between the government of the United
                            States. Of course, sitting where I sit—much committed as I am to the
                            idea of a United Europe, nevertheless, the point of view of protecting
                            American commercial interest—this is one we really couldn't take lying
                            down. Too much has been talked about it—said about it and I think we
                            have tended, perhaps to make too many speeches. Nevertheless, I think
                            the principle of the thing is absolutely right. I don't see how we can
                            avoid moving on it.</p>
                        <p>Childs: What I couldn't help but feel was that he doesn't understand the
                            pressures over in this country. I said, Jean, the next thing you will
                            get is the feed grain. He said you can't go on expecting to export all
                            that agricultural produce to Europe. If we can't, Jean, we will be out
                            of Europe.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Well, the real problem is
                            that down the line, if you look far enough, there is bound to be a
                            certain probable reduction in American agricultural exports to Europe or
                            at least they wont increase at the rate they have been increasing,
                            simply because they have gone up very fast since the war. Since the
                            agricultural technology hit here before it hit Europe and whether or not
                            there had been a common market, we would be facing problems in our
                            agricultural exports because we have now reached a point where over here
                            one farmer can produce ten times what a farmer could produce in pre-war
                            days and it is beginning to happen in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Childs: It is happening in France right now.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: Now there are two trends and
                            it is really quite interesting that one counteracts the other. On the
                            one hand Europe is going to begin to apply the new technology and
                            greatly increase productivity and that would tend to move Europe to self
                            sufficiency, but at the same time counteracting the fact that as the
                            standard of living in Europe rises, the Europeans are going to shift
                            their diet from direct cereal consumption into protein consumption. In
                            other words, instead of eating pasta as they do in Italy which is simply
                            the cereal grain cooked, they are going to eat meat and the fortunate
                            thing is that quite a bit of American agricultural export is…. A cow is
                            extremely interesting in that it takes something like 5 lbs. of grain to
                            produce a pound of meat, so then if you have a big counterpart…and since
                            cereals are one of the major exports, the total amount of cereal is
                            going to go up with the rising standard of living.</p>
                        <p>Childs: I see. This is a possibility. Jean talked about a World Food
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: We may have to have. And so
                            De Gaulle may be trying to use the threat of torpedoing the liberal
                            trade policy or even torpedoing the Common Market, unless the Germans
                            agree to a common agricultural policy. We get caught in this bind—right
                            in the middle of this thing to some extent. This is part of the
                            difficulty.</p>

                                xml:id="d286fn1">Not found.</note> the Embassy in London was
                            instructed to discuss the proposal for an international agreement on
                            wool textiles with Alan Green, Minister of State in the Board of Trade.
                            Mr. Green is on holiday in Rhodes and will not be back in London until
                            September 20. The President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Erroll, is also
                            abroad, until August 26. In the absence of these Ministers, the Embassy
                            discussed the matter with Sir Richard Powell, Permanent Secretary of the
                            Board of Trade, emphasizing the importance the United States attaches to
                            the initiation of steps looking toward an international arrangement on
                            wool textiles.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_PSRR1">Powell</persName> informed the Embassy that
                            Alan Green had met with representatives of the British wool textile
                            industry several weeks ago, had agreed to consider their views and,
                            approximately one week ago, had told them by letter that, after careful
                            consideration of their proposals, Her Majesty's Government maintained
                            its view in opposition to an international wool textile arrangement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PSRR1">Powell</persName> pointed out that
                            Green's reply could not be interpreted as encouraging the belief that
                            the British Government would give favorable consideration to an approach
                            by the United States regarding an international wool textile
                            arrangement. In response to a reiteration of U.S. views by the Embassy,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PSRR1">Powell</persName> stated that the
                            decision communicated by Green was taken at the Ministerial (political)
                            level. We understand that the U.K. position has been passed on to the
                            U.S. trade press by the British Embassy.</p>
                        <p>In light of the consistent opposition of the United Kingdom and other
                            exporting countries to an international agreement covering wool
                            textiles, I believe consideration should be given to steps by the
                            Administration to initiate a Tariff Commission investigation of the wool
                            textile situation under Section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930. We
                            continue to be handicapped both internationally and domestically by the
                            lack of an objective analysis of conditions in the wool textile
                            industry. The domestic <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0642"/>industry
                            insists that injury from imports is a fact. On the other hand, importers
                            and exporting countries maintain that no injury has been demonstrated;
                            they expect us to follow established procedures to determine whether
                            there is serious injury or the threat of serious injury from increased
                            imports. Any efforts to help the industry through domestic programs are
                            stymied by the absence of an independent and thorough study such as the
                            Tariff Commission makes under various provisions of the U.S.
                            legislation. Only after a factual analysis has been made by the Tariff
                            Commission will we be likely, in my view, to make progress
                            internationally or domestically toward the solution of the wool textile
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The proposal for a Tariff Commission study and report has been made in
                            the past and has been opposed by the domestic industry, which adamantly
                            refuses to re-initiate the action itself. Consequently, the domestic
                            industry would probably not consider reference to the Tariff Commission
                            as responsive to their situation. In the circumstances, I suggest that
                            you might wish to have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName>
                            talk with the interested Senators, lay before them the information on
                            the U.K. position received through Embassy London, point out the impasse
                            which has again been reached, and suggest a Tariff Commission report as
                            a sound basis for further efforts to help the domestic industry. If some
                            support for this approach were generated, you could then direct the
                            Tariff Commission to undertake the industry study.<note n="2"

                            your information the report of the White House Conference on Export
                            Expansion which was held on September 17-18, 1963. For your convenience,
                            I am also attaching a summary which reflects the highlights of the
                            reports of the several Committees.</p>
                        <p>The report is only a beginning. We plan to hold little “White House
                            Conferences” in all parts of the country starting next week so that the
                            export expansion story can be brought home to Americans everywhere.</p>

                        <p>May I thank you once again for your cooperation and support. The
                            enthusiastic reports we have been receiving from members of the
                            Conference on the way in which it was conducted and the results which
                            have been achieved are indeed gratifying.</p>
                        <p>We will now move forward promptly to develop appropriate action programs.
                            I am looking forward to your continued cooperation in this most
                            important task.</p>

                            <p>It is remarkable that so much was accomplished in the two short days
                                devoted to the White House Conference on Export Expansion. The
                                employment of the committee technique enabled the Conference to
                                produce a wide variety of significant recommendations. It is a
                                tribute to the caliber of the conferees that these complex problems
                                were so ably pre-sented for our consideration. Although the
                                Conference participants represented many diverse interests and
                                deliberated in eleven different groups, their conclusions blend and
                                complement one another.</p>
                            <p>While each Committee recognized and carried forward its individual
                                task, reference was made to policies under consideration by other
                                Committees when it was felt their relationship was significant. I
                                should like to mention the most important of these.</p>
                            <p>Several Committees strongly urged that an export tax incentive based
                                upon increases in exports is of the highest priority in the Export
                                Expansion Program. The Committee on “Tax Policies and Export
                                Expansion” developed specific recommendations in this regard. Some
                                members <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0644"/>of the Labor
                                Committee felt we should concentrate on the elimination of the tax
                                subsidies of other countries instead of recommending a U.S. tax
                                incentive program, but this represented the view of a small
                                minority.</p>
                            <p>While one Committee had responsibility for studying commercial
                                representation overseas, several Committees addressed themselves to
                                this subject.</p>
                            <p>It was the general view that since the Department of Commerce has
                                primary responsibility for trade promotion, it should also have
                                responsibility for the selection, training, appointment, and
                                assignment of all Commercial Officers. One Committee bluntly stated
                                that the Export Expansion Program would only be a success if the
                                Department of Commerce had direct control over all commercial
                                programs overseas. Each of these Committees recognized that the
                                Ambassador, as the President's representative for all overseas
                                programs, would be in charge in the field.</p>
                            <p>Several Committees noted the need for more active participation in
                                commercial work by Ambassadors themselves. They also urged more
                                intimate relationships with the U.S. business community, greater
                                assist-ance and support, and suggested means for bringing this
                                about.</p>
                            <p>Another topic of general interest concerned U.S. trade with the
                                Soviet bloc. The views of a number of Committees were reflected in
                                the recommendation that the U.S. re-examine the extent to which
                                there might be an expansion of trade with the bloc in the light of
                                the changing world situation.</p>
                            <p>Several of the Committees urged the strengthening of the Department
                                of Commerce's information services. They noted the importance of
                                attacking non-tariff barriers as well as seeking tariff reductions
                                in the forthcoming Geneva negotiations. A number of Committees also
                                recommended equalization of ocean freight rates and simplification
                                of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> procurement policies. It was
                                felt that present <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> regulations
                                distort normal commercial practices and divert business from U.S.
                                exports.</p>
                            <p>Three Committees also called attention to the beneficial relationship
                                between foreign investment and U.S. exports. A number of the
                                Committees discussed ways and means of achieving an early and rapid
                                increase in U.S. exports. It was the consensus that a strong attack
                                on this problem must be directed on a person-to-person basis to
                                non-exporters. It was recommended that the Department of Commerce
                                and its National and Regional Export Expansion Councils mobilize
                                their resources to maximize this personal effort.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador said that rumors were circulating in Tokyo to the effect
                            that the United States is approaching Italy and the U.K. on a plan to
                            conclude an international agreement on wool textile imports after the
                            pattern of the cotton textile arrangement. He said that the Japanese
                            would not like such an arrangement and were concerned about the
                            possibility of such a proposal. They fear that one day the U.S. may
                            approach Japan saying it has agreement with Italy and others and asking
                            Japan to join.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that there had been great pressure from the
                            American industry to do something about wool textile imports. This was a
                            matter of considerable discussion within the Administration some time
                            ago.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that not very long
                            ago representatives of the American wool textile trade returned from the
                            U.K. reporting that some sectors of the British trade would favor an
                            international agreement. The U.S. Government therefore inquired of the
                            British Government if they would be prepared to consider an
                            international agreement; the British Government's response was negative.
                            He said that we had not discussed this with the Italian Government,
                            although we may have reported to them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said that developments in wool textile imports
                            continue to be a matter of concern. He said that we have again been
                            advised informally by the American trade that they have been in touch
                            with the British, Italian and French wool textile trade and that there
                            is sentiment in Europe favoring some arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary said that the U.S. has no present plans to try to
                            press for any kind of arrangement. If, however, it were to become clear
                            that the British and Italian Governments were inclined to go along with
                            an international arrangement, we would find ourselves in a difficult <pb
                                n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0646"/>position to avoid it.
                            Therefore, the Acting Secretary could not say that the U.S. would never
                            come to the Japanese Government with such a proposal.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he hoped that Japan would not be placed in the
                            position of being the last to know of any such plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we would keep the
                            Ambassador fully informed. He pointed out that the initiative had been
                            that of the U.S. industry. He wondered if the U.S. industry had been in
                            touch with the Japanese industry—as they had with the British and
                            Italian Governments. The Ambassador believed the Japanese industry had
                            not been approached.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary wondered why the Italian industry would favor such
                            an arrangement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said his information was that the Italian industry as a
                            whole opposed such an arrangement but that certain members of the
                            industry are resigned to it. With the “<persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round” in the offing and pressures from the
                            U.S., some of the Italian trade reportedly believe it may be better to
                            acquiesce now and get a better deal. The Ambassador said he did not feel
                            very sure about Italy, but felt more sure about the British. He thought
                            perhaps that it would be best for Japan to speak out. He emphasized
                            again that the Japanese do not want to be the last to be informed and
                            find themselves cornered.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary assured the Ambassador that if the matter reached
                            the governmental level he would be kept informed.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that, without referring to anything the Acting
                            Secretary had said, he intended to warn his Government that it must not
                            be too optimistic on this matter. He also indicated that he might
                            recommend that his Government tell the outside world that it opposes a
                            wool textile agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador commented that the cotton textile agreement, with its
                            detailed and restrictive provisions, was very difficult to handle in
                            Japan, and to add a wool textile agreement would be most difficult. He
                            expressed the view that such a proposal would constitute the worst
                            possible propaganda for the U.S.</p>

                        <p>Replying to Sir Richard Powell's query about the prospects for the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he was reasonably optimistic.
                            Sir Richard said the British thought the clouds looked very ominous from
                            France, particularly on the question of disparities. The French would
                            attempt to avoid being seen as wreckers of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round but they would not help
                            it towards a successful conclusion; they would probably be content to
                            see it fail. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he had
                            found Couve de Murville somewhat—if vaguely—encouraging on the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round prospects when he talked
                            to him a few days ago. However there was always the possibility of a
                            pronouncement from the Elysee. When Sir Richard asked what the French
                            attitude was towards agriculture, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> said de Murville had indicated he thought some
                            progress could be made at least on dairy products, with the more
                            difficult problems to be resolved later.</p>
                        <p>Sir Richard asked how important the U.S. considered the timing of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round. He personally
                            thought the U.S. slowness in submitting its list of exceptions might
                            delay the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round until
                            autumn, 1964. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied
                            that the U.S. did not feel bound to a schedule and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJR3">Schaetzel</persName> said the U.S. wanted to keep
                            moving but not to press ahead too fast. As Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said, the French had asked us not
                            to push too hard.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> has called my attention to your interest
                            in the United Nations Trade Conference which is scheduled to last for
                            three months in Geneva beginning in March of next year.</p>
                        <p>We have been concerned about this conference for some time since it may
                            provide a forum in which some well-intentioned people—encouraged by
                            others less benign—can do considerable mischief.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand—wisely managed—the breakage could be minimized and a
                            degree of useful education achieved.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Background</p>
                        <p>The conference is the resultant of two forces: the discontent of the less
                            developed countries with the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>,
                            which they regard as an institution run by and for the benefit of the
                            great trading nations; and the tactical interest of the Soviet Union in
                            undermining the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> primarily for
                            political purposes.</p>
                        <p>The dislike of the less developed countries for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> has been fermenting over a period of
                            years. There has long been talk of a competing organization based on a
                            rejection of the orthodox ideal of a multi-lateral, non-discriminatory
                            trading world that would focus on the special requirements of the less
                            developed countries. At the same time state trading does not fit
                            comfortably with multi-lateralism, and the Kremlin has seen possible
                            paydirt in an effort that might create discomfort for the West.</p>
                        <p>These forces first came together in support of a common objective during
                            the 1961 General Assembly of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> when
                            the idea of a world trade conference began to acquire momentum.</p>
                        <p>At the July 1962 <gloss target="#t_ECOSOC1">ECOSOC</gloss>
                            meeting—following an Afro-Asian Bloc meeting on trade in Cairo—the US
                            delegation decided that such a conference could not be blocked. It,
                            therefore, used its discretionary authority to move from frontal
                            opposition to an acceptance of the inevitable—in the hope of gaining
                            some influence over the content and timing of the <pb n="623"
                                xml:id="pg_623" facs="0649"/>conference. In spite of US delaying
                            tactics, it did not prove feasible to postpone the conference beyond
                            1964.</p>
                        <p>In its preparatory stage, Dr. Prebisch<note n="1" xml:id="d290fn1"> Raul
                                Prebisch, Argentine economist; Director General of the Latin
                                American Institute for Economic and Social Planning.</note> has been
                            the most determined and articulate promoter of the conference. During
                            the past year there have been several sessions of a preparatory
                            committee consisting of representatives of 32 nations. The Soviet Union
                            made a diligent effort to assure that the conference agenda would
                            include East-West trade, disarmament and other Bloc propaganda
                            interests. But for the time being it has apparently concluded to accept
                            the indications that the conference would concentrate on the trade
                            problem of the less-developed countries.</p>
                        <p>The conference agenda as it now stands puts major emphasis on measures to
                            increase the export earnings of the developing countries. The most
                            serious questions likely to emerge concern proposals to use commodity
                            agreements to improve earnings from the sale of raw materials and a
                            proposal that the economically advanced countries extend preferential
                            treatment to the imports of manufactures from the developing countries.
                            This latter device—which is the newest steed in the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss> stable of hobby horses—could turn out
                            to be a particularly fractious beast.</p>
                        <p>In addition to these substantive measures we shall also need to cope with
                            efforts to supplant <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> by a new
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trade organization that would
                            include the Bloc and be heavily biased to serve the interests of
                            developing countries. Alternatively the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>s may seek to create a separate organization to compete
                            with <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>During recent years the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s have
                            clamoured for a widening range of commodity agreements as the panacea
                            for their foreign exchange problems. Early in your Administration, you
                            shifted the traditional U.S. position from doctrinaire opposition to
                            measured support of commodity agreements.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, an irreconcilable difference between the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s view of commodity agreements and our
                            own. We look upon commodity agreements—in the limited number of cases
                            where they are feasible—as a device to avoid cyclical price fluctuations
                            for raw materials and thus as a means to help assure stability for the
                            foreign exchange income of primary producing countries. This is not,
                            however, the favored view of the developing countries, which tend to
                            look on commodity agreements as devices to peg world prices well above
                            existing levels and thus provide the producing countries with a
                            subsidy—which they might use to finance their development requirements.
                            (On the domestic scene we do, <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0650"
                            />of course, accept that philosophy in our own agricultural price
                            support programs.)</p>
                        <p>This conflict in philosophy holds the seeds of embarrassment for us. At a
                            recent conference in Geneva for the purpose of drafting a commodity
                            agreement on cocoa the United States could have been caught in a serious
                            bind if the producing countries (led by Ghana) had not insisted upon
                            demanding a ridiculously high minimum price. Had the developing
                            countries been less foolish, we would have been under heavy pressure to
                            agree to a minimum price that would have been violently opposed by our
                            industrial cocoa consumers. In that event, we might have been left with
                            an agreement that Congress would have refused to ratify.</p>
                        <p>I foresee no need to change our established position at the Geneva
                            Conference. We should continue to support commodity agreements at
                            reasonable price levels where appropriate for stabilization
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Stickiest Issue—The Preference Question</p>
                        <p>The basic economic argument underlying the preference proposal is,
                            abstractly stated, sound enough. In an almost perfect world, the
                            economically-advanced countries should progressively concentrate on the
                            production of sophisticated and capital-intensive industrial products,
                            leaving an increasingly wide area of simple labor-intensive products to
                            be supplied by countries in the early stages of industrialization. Under
                            a regime in which the principle of comparative advantage could operate
                            freely, the less-developed countries would thus be able to exploit what
                            is in most instances their sole advantage—an abundant supply of low-cost
                            labor—while the economically-advanced countries exploited their
                            advantages in capital, technology, and skilled labor.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Trade Expansion Act is to move toward this kind of
                            regime, but it implicitly recognizes that we do not live in an almost
                            perfect world. Progress in this direction must therefore be kept within
                            the bounds of political reality and it cannot always be in a straight
                            line. Experience has shown that domestic pressures accumulate in direct
                            proportion to the increasing share of our domestic market claimed by the
                                <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s. I need only recall our
                            experience with cotton textiles, electronic equipment, etc. to make the
                            point.</p>
                        <p>In their preoccupation with their export problem, spokesmen for the
                            less-developed countries have been deflected from the objective of
                            gaining increasingly liberal access for their goods in the markets of
                            the industrialized countries. They are demanding preferential treatment
                            particularly for their manufactures. How should we deal with this
                            demand?</p>
                        <p>I believe we have little to gain and much to lose by encouraging them to
                            pursue a manifestly unrealistic objective. Experience should <pb n="625"
                                xml:id="pg_625" facs="0651"/>have taught us by now that the way to
                            create bitterness is to permit the burgeoning of aspirations that are
                            ultimately frustrated. The Biblical observation that “hope deferred,
                            maketh the heart sick” applies as much to countries as to individuals.
                            Already we have incurred considerable enmity by our need to administer
                            in a rigid manner a cotton textile agreement that we had originally
                            merchandised to the developing countries as a device for assuring the
                            measured growth of their exports.</p>
                        <p>I have concluded, therefore, that we should be reasonably candid with our
                            less-developed friends. This is contrary to bureaucratic instincts, for
                            there is a strong prejudice against saying things that may create even
                            temporary unhappiness. But if we were to behave in too bland a manner
                            with this issue, we would diminish our credibility on other issues.</p>
                        <p>More than that, we would run grave risks of embarrassing the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round on the home front.
                            Already the trade associations have gotten wind of the United Nations
                            Trade Conference. They are uttering increasingly loud cries of alarm. I
                            can think of nothing the protectionists would like better than the
                            opportunity next Spring—just before the beginning of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round and at the start of a
                            Presidential campaign—to be able to accuse the Administration of lending
                            a sympathetic ear to proposals that would grant preferences in the
                            American market for “the cheap labor products of Asia”—or that would
                            give Hong Kong a preference over New England in the markets of third
                            countries. What kind of a spectacle would we make, if—at the moment we
                            were trying to dampen down the fires in the United Nations meeting at
                            Geneva—we felt compelled to assure the United States Congress that we
                            abhorred preferences?</p>
                        <p>All of this does not mean, of course, that we should turn a deaf ear to
                            the concerns of less-developed countries. On the contrary, we should do
                            them the honor of regarding them as adult by raising the discussion to
                            the plane of political reality. The problem after all is basically one
                            of education and persuasion. In this spirit I have arranged with Dr.
                            Prebisch to have conversations in depth with him on my return to
                            Washington. I hope also, between now and the end of the year, to have a
                            series of quiet talks with the principal moving spirits behind the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> conference. Most of these men are
                            likely to be in New York during this period in connection with <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> business.</p>
                        <p>I intend in these discussions to lead away from the preference proposal
                            toward more fruitful approaches to the problem of industrial exports. I
                            am helped in this endeavor by the fact that this problem has not come to
                            me as a fresh idea. I have been beating the drum on the issue for years.
                            During 1961, for example, I made at least five speeches to call
                            attention to this critical problem. Dr. Prebisch told me the other day
                            that <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0652"/>my views on this issue
                            were well known and deeply appreciated by the economists in the
                            developing countries.</p>

                            <item>At the <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss> meeting, we shall
                                make clear that the US Government has long taken the lead in
                                searching for means to solve the difficult problem of increasing the
                                exports of the developing countries. We can do this persuasively
                                since I have taken a strong line on this question during the last
                                two ministerial meetings of the <gloss target="#t_OECD1"

                            <item>We shall also demonstrate that the US record on this issue is, in
                                comparison with most other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                countries, quite respectable. We are having figures prepared to show
                                that the US has discriminated far less against industrial exports of
                                the developing countries than have the countries of the European
                                Community. (In spite of the special preferences that France extends
                                to the French Community countries, her record, in statistical terms,
                                is bad.)</item>

                                One must distinguish, of course, between two quite distinct kinds of
                                preferences: (a) those accorded by a metropolitan power to a
                                specific group of countries that formed part of an earlier colonial
                                system and (b) preferences that are extended impartially to all
                                developing countries. The former is, of course, a relic of
                                colonialism, and it is not what the developing countries are talking
                                about.</item>

                            <item>This point is fundamental and we shall insist that there be no
                                ambiguity with regard to this distinction.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>In discussing the general principle of preferences we shall point
                                out that they are both undesirable and unnecessary. If industry is
                                to have a healthy growth in a developing country, it must be of a
                                kind that will make use of that country's natural advantages. For
                                most developing countries the sole natural advantage consists of an
                                ample supply of low-cost labor. In most cases this should be
                                adequate to assure markets for labor-intensive goods—provided only
                                that the advanced countries would eliminate restrictive and
                                discriminatory measures.</item>

                                therefore, be to hasten the erosion of that framework of
                                discrimination which has been built up against imports from
                                developing countries, and we shall advocate that the <gloss

                                their record with regard to discrimination before the Conference

                            <item>At the same time, we shall suggest that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations encourage regional
                                arrangements among developing countries. The advantage of such
                                regional arrangements—whether customs unions, free trade areas or
                                even regional preferential systems—is that they permit the building
                                of mass markets for the developing countries. They can thus provide
                                conditions for efficient industrial growth at a minimum cost in
                                economic dislocation. To achieve useful results, however, we shall
                                have to recognize that such regional arrangements require a
                                considerable measure of common planning to avoid redundant
                                production and to achieve an intelligent allocation of industrial
                                tasks.</item>

                            <item>I propose to emphasize regional arrangements because I have
                                considerable mistrust of encouraging another idea put forward by Dr.
                                Prebisch—that each developing country accord preferences to the
                                industrial goods of all others. I do not believe that this would be
                                likely to result in an effective allocation of resources; on the
                                contrary it could seriously distort investment patterns with little
                                benefit to anyone.</item>

                            <item>Obviously, these are only some of the measures that are available

                                would not rule out other approaches. I am, however, suspicious of
                                gimmicks—particularly when the problem should be soluble by a
                                rigorous adherence to the principles of non-discrimination in which
                                we have invested so much time and effort for the last three

                        <p>It is too early to put forward a detailed plan of action for the American
                            delegation at the Conference. The line to take will depend, in
                            considerable part, on the attitude not merely of the developing
                            countries but also of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies.
                            At the moment I can recommend only one controlling principle: that we
                            display patience but do not talk nonsense.</p>
                        <p>We must, of course, be concerned to preserve the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> against efforts to transform it into a debating forum
                            for special interests or to supplant it with a more diffuse
                            organization. Fortunately, I think this problem is manageable. Already
                            there are signs that the more stable leaders in the developing countries
                            are having second thoughts on the value of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss>, and I am confident that with a steady American policy
                            we should have little difficulty in saving it from serious
                            impairment.</p>

                            <p>The trade negotiations will be a test of the Atlantic Community's
                                will to cooperate in the economic field. Failure to negotiate a
                                significant reduction in trade barriers could do incalculable harm
                                to the unity and strength of the Free World. It could lead to a
                                return to nationalistic protectionism both here and in Europe,
                                tending to stifle the opportunities for expansion of our foreign
                                trade and our economy.</p>
                            <p>For the European Economic Community it could be a crisis more serious
                                than the one caused by the rejection of the U.K.'s application for
                                    <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0655"/>membership. The French
                                have shown considerable reluctance to enter into meaningful
                                negotiations. The West German Government appears genuinely
                                interested in having the negotiations succeed. It has taken the
                                position that further progress on internal Common Market decisions
                                must be synchronized with decisions of the European Economic
                                Community in the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                                Round. The Germans thus hope to trade German approval of the
                                remaining agricultural regulations, which the French want, for
                                French cooperation in cutting tariffs in the <persName

                                want.</p>
                            <p>There are many who believe that if these issues cannot be resolved in
                                a manner that causes <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> cooperation
                                in the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round,
                                centrifugal forces would set in which could in time destroy the

                            <p>The first important step towards the negotiations took place at the
                                Ministerial Meeting of the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> in
                                May 1963. This meeting brought to a head a disagreement between the
                                U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> on the general plan
                                of the negotiations. The U.S. stood for broad cuts of all tariffs by
                                an equal percentage, with a minimum of exceptions. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, largely at French initiative,
                                argued that the objective should be harmonization of the tariff
                                systems of the industrialized countries, which would require that
                                high tariffs be reduced by a greater percentage than low ones. This
                                approach would result in greater concessions by the U.S. than the
                                    <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, since the U.S. has more
                                high tariffs than the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, though
                                our average tariff levels are about the same.</p>
                            <p>The Ministerial resolution which emerged from this meeting set the

                                    and justification. Special rules, however, should be adopted to

                                        regulations even after they are adopted by the <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Council. In fact, there
                                        have been signs for some time that the <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would prefer to separate
                                        agriculture entirely from the general tariff cutting rules
                                        of the negotiations, which in effect is what happened in the
                                        previous <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>
                                        Round. Most recently, Vice President <persName

                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission has put forward
                                        a proposal for general treatment of agricultural products in
                                        this round. Under the <persName corresp="#p_MSL2"
                                            >Mansholt</persName> negotiating plan the <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would first agree on the
                                        remainder of its common agricultural policy. After this is
                                        done the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would offer to
                                        bind the then existing level of protection if all countries
                                        would do the same. Negotiation of reductions in levels of
                                        protection are specifically ruled out except in special
                                        circumstances. Further, under the proposal the <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> apparently would also
                                        withdraw without compensation all existing tariff bindings
                                        on agricultural products.</p>
                                    <p>In our view this plan would effectively remove the
                                        possibility of significant relaxation of agricultural trade
                                        restrictions in the course of this negotiation. Our feeling
                                        is therefore that this plan is incompatible with the
                                        Ministerial decision of last May.</p>
                                    <p>Perhaps the most important recent development relating to
                                        agriculture has been Mansholt's proposal for settlement of
                                        the very sensitive <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0657"
                                        />question of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> common
                                        grain prices. This has long been an issue particularly
                                        between France, whose grains prices are relatively low
                                        (though considerably higher than U.S. prices), and West
                                        Germany, whose prices are high. To date, the <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> has been a heavy importer
                                        of grains, many of them from the U.S. If the common <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> price were set much higher
                                        than the current French price, there is a very real danger
                                        that much extra production would be stimulated within
                                        France, and U.S. grain exports would consequently fall. The
                                        price level now proposed by the Commission, which is almost
                                        midway between the French and German prices, would in our
                                        opinion artificially stimulate such extra production.</p>
                                    <p>A great deal of pressure has built up within the <gloss
                                            target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> to settle at least the
                                        rice, meats, and dairy regulations by the end of this year
                                        or early next. The <persName corresp="#p_MSL2"
                                            >Mansholt</persName> grains proposal has also won
                                        considerable support, though its chances for early
                                        implementation are lower. The Germans, to whom agreement on
                                        these arrangements would be a significant concession, appear
                                        to be willing to seek, as a quid pro quo for their
                                        agreement, France's cooperation in the <persName

                                    <p>We feel that the U.S. must at the earliest possible

                                        agricultural negotiating plan. We also wish to encourage the
                                        Germans to use their adherence to agricultural regulations
                                        as a lever with which to secure France's agreement to a
                                        reasonable approach on disparities and the linear cut. We
                                        hope that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1"

                            <p>While the deliberations since last May have explored a wide variety
                                of measures to implement these principles, the developing nations
                                have concentrated their demands upon new tariff preferences by the
                                industrialized countries for their exports. They contend that such
                                preferences are necessary to stimulate their export trade in
                                manufactures upon <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0658"/>which
                                they feel they must rely for foreign earnings and domestic growth of
                                their economies.</p>
                            <p>Even though the economic benefits of such preferences have yet to be
                                clearly established, virtually every industrial nation except the
                                United States now appears to be looking favorably on this request,
                                primarily on political grounds. Our reluctance to join them has been
                                conditioned largely by the fact that most preference proposals would
                                require revisions in our law, since the Trade Expansion Act requires
                                that U.S. tariff concessions be made on a most-favored-nation basis,
                                and, further, that they would in all likelihood involve the products
                                of certain domestic industries already sensitive to import
                                competition. Thus far we have merely indicated a willingness to
                                consider the many implications of these schemes.</p>
                            <p>On the more affirmative side, we have held that a broad and deep
                                tariff cut, accompanied by concerted measures to remove other trade
                                barriers by all industrial nations and supplemented by financial and
                                other assistance, will go far toward improving trading prospects of
                                these countries.</p>

                            <p>Formal domestic preparations for the negotiations began on December 2
                                with the opening of public hearings by both the Tariff Commission
                                and the interagency Trade Information Committee, as required by the
                                Trade Expansion Act. The Tariff Commission will report to you by
                                April 21, 1964, its advice as to the probable economic effect of
                                U.S. tariff reductions on the various domestic industries. The Trade
                                Information Committee hearings, which are chaired by a member of the
                                Special Representative's Office, will concentrate on the foreign
                                trade restrictions whose reduction would be of greatest benefit to
                                U.S. exporting industries. Its report will be available to you at
                                about the same time as the Tariff Commission's.</p>

                            <p>The opening of the hearings will probably usher in a period of
                                increasing pressure on you, your staff, and various executive
                                departments to make commitments to withhold particular items from
                                the general tariff reduction. As noted above, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> Ministers resolved that such
                                exceptions should be kept to a bare minimum, subject to
                                “confrontation and justification.” The Trade Expansion Act requires
                                that any item on which special trade restrictions are in force under
                                the “escape clause” or “national security” provisions of our laws
                                must be excepted. Certain others involved in past escape-clause
                                cases must be excepted under certain circumstances. The decision on
                                excepting any items apart from these few mandatory ones rests, by
                                law, in your hands, after taking into account the advice of the
                                various agencies.</p>

                            <p>The Office of the Special Representative will gather information from
                                sources within and without the Government, will weigh the advice of
                                the Tariff Commission, and will present you with recommendations on
                                this score, probably in the late spring of next year. A preliminary
                                decision on exceptions may be made at that time, but in order to
                                permit a meaningful process of “confrontation and justification,” we
                                would recommend that no hard and fast decisions on exceptions be
                                made until after this process is completed. We shall be able to
                                negotiate changes that we want in other countries' exceptions lists
                                only by being prepared to make changes in our own. This course would
                                have the additional benefit of enabling you and other members of

                                weeks is whether to have the Tariff Commission investigate the
                                consequences of reduction or termination of the special
                                “escape-clause” protection now in force. Other countries and our own
                                importers look to us to conduct these investigations as a sign of
                                our good faith in liberal trade. The domestic industries involved
                                oppose such investigations as creating uncertainties which upset
                                their business.</p>
                            <p>Decisions have now been made on two of the eight current
                                escape-clause cases. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                    >Kennedy</persName> last month decided not to alter the tariff
                                on clinical thermometers on the basis of an investigation by the
                                Tariff Commission, and this week you agreed that the Tariff
                                Commission should make a further investigation of watches. Our
                                office will make further recommendations to you on the remaining
                                items over the next several months. Prior consultation with your
                                staff, however, will enable us to be certain that political
                                implications are taken into consideration in our
                                recommendations.</p>

                            <p>The Trade Expansion Act requires the Special Representative to “seek
                                information and advice with respect to each negotiation from
                                representatives of industry, agriculture, and labor.” We propose
                                that you should establish a Public Advisory Committee to the Special
                                Representative composed of about 35 distinguished persons in these
                                fields. They would meet with us periodically to express their views
                                on the various <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0660"/>issues that
                                arise in the course of preparing for the negotiations. Once the
                                negotiations begin next year, some of them may go to Geneva as
                                public advisors to the delegation.</p>
                            <p>We have cleared with the various agencies a list of names proposed as
                                members of this committee, and an order establishing the committee
                                will be sent to you for approval very shortly.</p>
                            <p>The Act also stipulates that two members of the House Committee on
                                Ways and Means and of the Senate Committee on Finance shall act as
                                Congressional delegates to the negotiations and be members of the
                                U.S. delegation.</p>
                            <p>The members of Congress who have been selected are: <list>

                            <p>The position of Special Representative for Trade Negotiations was
                                created by Congress in order to assign responsibility for directing
                                the trade negotiations and their preparation to someone within the
                                President's own Office. By Executive Order, President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> designated the Special
                                Representative to advise and assist him in the administration of
                                trade agreements carried out under the Trade Expansion Act and
                                certain other authorities. He also delegated to the Special
                                Representative the duty of seeking advice and information on
                                proposed trade agreements from various executive departments and
                                other sources. The Special Representative therefore acts as the
                                channel to you of information and advice on the trade agreements
                                program from the agencies within the Executive Branch.</p>
                            <p>Policy decisions in the field of trade agreements and the
                                recommendations made to you by the Special Representative are, as a
                                rule, based upon decisions taken by the Trade Executive Committee
                                made up of senior representatives of seven agencies. The Special
                                Representative has a small staff of his own, however, which
                                constitutes a separate agency within the Executive Office of the
                                President and which is of course at your call at all times.</p>

                        <p>The United States notified the Executive Secretary of the General
                            Agreement on Tariffs and Trade today that it will suspend tariff
                            concessions on brandy, trucks, dextrine, and starches. Higher tariffs on
                            these articles will go into effect on January 7, 1964. This action is
                            being taken to restore the balance of tariff concessions upset by
                            restrictions imposed on poultry imports by the European Economic
                            Community.</p>
                        <p>The new rates will apply to imports of these articles from any source.
                            The original tariff concessions on them, however, had been negotiated
                            with member states of the European Economic Community. These nations
                            account for 94 per cent of United States imports of the affected
                            articles.</p>

                                oral arguments, was well below the U.S. calculation of $40 million,

                            The negotiations are to “be based upon a plan of substantial linear

                            special rules of general and automatic application.” It was further
                            specified that the term “significant” means “meaningful in trade terms”
                            and that the purpose of the special rules is to reduce the
                            disparities.</p>

                        <p>The advantage of a high cut-off level (the U.S. has pushed for 60 per
                            cent) coupled with an arrangement whereby the low rather than the high
                            duty country departs from the linear cut is that the trade coverage
                            subject to special treatment is minimized. It is precisely in high duty
                            items that the U.S. does not have a comparative advantage and,
                            therefore, the volume of U.S. exports on which less than the linear cut
                            is made tends to be small. For example, if the <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> cuts only 20 per cent on all the U.S. disparities it
                            can claim under the unqualified 30-10 rule and 50 per cent on all other
                            items, its average cut will still be 48 per cent. Securing the
                            accept-ance of such criteria as (i), (iii), and (vi) above not only
                            would reduce the direct trade effects of the disparity issue
                            substantially more but also would minimize the possibility of
                            restrictive actions by third countries who are adversely affected by the
                            Community's smaller cut on disparity items.</p>

                            low rate by at least 10 percentage points. For semi-manufactures, only
                            the 2 to 1 ratio would apply. However, the Council did agree to the
                            notion that disparities should be identified only with reference to the

                                <item>Rejected the “low must be a principal supplier to high” rule,

                        <p>Preliminary analyses of the 2-1 plus 10 points rule indicates that, even
                            without the special treatment for semi-manufactures, the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> could invoke about 1100 disparities
                            against the U.S. The U.S. could, however, claim 550 against the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Trade coverage data on these items is
                            not yet available but it is likely to be considerably greater than that
                            involved in the 30-10 rule. Furthermore, the total number of disparities
                            that can be invoked against the U.S. may be much larger than 1100. There
                            may be hardly a U.S. (or <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> and U.K)
                            item on which some <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> member does not
                            have a duty that is less than one-half of it as well as below it by at
                            least 10 percentage points.</p>
                        <p>By the same token, the value of U.S. exports on which a less than 50 per
                            cent cut will be made is likely to be considerably larger, especially
                            since no longer will just high duty industries be involved. In addition,
                            the qualitative criteria accepted will make much of the identification
                            procedure an item-by-item hassle. It thereby will prolong the
                            negotiations and complicate the “end-of-the day” balancing procedure.
                            Finally, the special treatment for semi-manufactures (merely 2 to 1
                            without a 10-point spread) seems tailor-made to provide an additional
                            element of protection for such sensitive <gloss target="#t_EEC1"
                                >EEC</gloss> industries as aluminum, paper, and steel.</p>

                            asking the Chancellor and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> for their evaluation of the recent <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> talks at Brussels.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>
                            described the situation that existed at the time of the Brussels
                            meeting. It had been agreed on May 9 that there would be a synchronized
                            program of negotiations. For the Federal Republic that meant that there
                            would be not only internal development within the Common Market,
                            especially agriculture, but also outward development looking toward the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round. This situation
                            culminated in the Brussels negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> went on to say that
                            difficulties existed at Brussels because the interest of France and some
                            other participants related more to agriculture than to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round, and also because it was
                            obviously impossible to lay down specific positions regarding the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round at this early
                            point. There was therefore a danger that the negotiations could fall
                            apart before any decisions were reached.</p>
                        <p>The French had come to recognize, however, that the Federal Republic was
                            serious about the importance of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round. As a result, the French position has
                            become somewhat better. Reasonable compromises were achieved, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> felt, both in
                            agriculture and in the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            Round position.</p>
                        <p>The change in the French viewpoint, the Foreign Minister continued, was
                            illustrated by the latest meeting between General De Gaulle and the
                            German Ambassador in Paris. De Gaulle said to the Ambassador that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round was an
                            Anglo-Saxon matter but because of the German attitude France would take
                            a different view than before.</p>
                        <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked when that
                            conversation had taken place. The Foreign Minister said that it had
                            occurred a few days before the recent Brussels talks.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister continued that the Rome treaty and its implementing
                            regulations provide not only for internal development within the Common
                            Market but also for consideration of its external aspects. World trade
                            and external conditions must also be considered by the Common Market
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>Disparities had been the most difficult question to resolve at Brussels,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said. The Germans
                            were able to bring about agreement on a new two-to-one formula. This
                            would mean, according to German experts, a reduction in the number of
                            disparities: previously the number would have been twelve hundred US
                            items and a few for the Europeans, whereas now the ratio would be about
                            four to one—eight hundred US to two hundred European. This is the
                            conclusion of German experts.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister emphasized that there are a number of details which
                            are not yet clear. The <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> Commission
                            directive is not yet available. When this is available more detailed
                            discussion can be useful. Nevertheless, German experts believe that
                            sufficient agreement was reached at Brussels to enable the Commission to
                            formulate a position for the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round. The French position is definitely more
                            favorable than before.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister repeated that Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> had succeeded in convincing De Gaulle in November
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round was as
                            important or more important to Germany than the agricultural
                            regulations. The French now clearly recognize this, as illustrated by
                            recent statements by Pompidou and Giscard.</p>
                        <p>In summary the Foreign Minister expressed the belief that the Brussels
                            compromise had been fairly good in balancing Community and <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round interests.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said he
                            would like to add one thought. No decision was taken on cereal prices.
                            This is to be done in April 1964. The <persName corresp="#p_MSL2"
                                >Mansholt</persName> Plan<note n="1" xml:id="d294fn1">See <ref
                                    target="#d291">Document 291</ref>.</note> will be the basis of
                            consideration but it will not be accepted without change in the
                            establishment of Common Market cereal prices. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> noted that the French and
                            other Community members object to some portions of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSL2">Mansholt</persName> Plan. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> also said that the Germans had
                            got a clause inserted in the agreement on this subject which would make
                            agricultural policy more negotiable; this had <pb n="642"
                                xml:id="pg_642" facs="0668"/>not been easy to do in view of the
                            Common Market agricultural regulations on the one hand and the
                            preparations for the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName>
                            Round on the other.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> said that the US
                            had followed the Brussels negotiations closely, had realized the
                            difficulties faced by the Federal Republic both in its own agricultural
                            problems and in the French position, and was most appreciative of the
                            efforts made by the Federal Republic at Brussels to insure consideration
                            of the position of third parties. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> noted that the US is handicapped by not having
                            the text of the arrangements agreed to at Brussels.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> went on to say
                            that what was most satisfying in Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>'s comments was the point that
                            agricultural matters would be subject to negotiation. It would have been
                            most difficult for the US had it been presented with a fait
                            accompli.</p>
                        <p>As regards disparities the initial analysis by the US indicates that the
                            new formula presents many complications. The new formula would by this
                            analysis add 250 items to the US list of disparities and nearly 500 to
                            the European list; this complicates rather than simplifies the problem.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> expressed the
                            view that US experts should meet with Common Market experts and attempt
                            to reach agreement on the facts. The problem of disparities could then
                            be worked out. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName>
                            stressed the difficulty of this problem for the United States and said
                            that it would be difficult to say that the US is pleased by the new
                            formula.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that
                            it is highly desirable for experts on both sides to get together and
                            agree on the facts. A common understanding could thereafter be
                            developed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that if
                            the German analysis is correct, the Brussels agreements represent a step
                            forward.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> said it
                            is unfortunate Mr. Lahr,<note n="2" xml:id="d294fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> one of the senior experts of the Foreign Office,
                            was not present for these discussions. The Foreign Minister said he
                            could only sum up the results as he understood them but he could not of
                            course prove his points.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1">Herter</persName> noted that the
                                <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries consider the
                            Brussels formula unacceptable. Their reasons are not clear but they
                            obviously feel that there are very many complexities to be worked
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> said that he has
                            a great interest in this problem. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HCAJ1"
                                >Herter</persName> and he in a sense had baptized the child at the
                                <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> conference earlier this year.
                            The Chancellor added that he wants the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> Round to be a success. The Chancellor went on to
                            say that the Federal <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0669"/>Republic
                            had relatively little interest in the Common Market regulations but was
                            highly interested in expanding trade as much as possible. Nevertheless
                            it must take its partners into consideration. The Federal Republic feels
                            that it has succeeded in getting adequate agreement in preparation for
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round. It had also
                            succeeded in getting the interests of <gloss target="#t_EFTA1"
                                >EFTA</gloss>, Commonwealth nations and other third parties taken
                            into account in the agricultural regulations. The Chancellor noted that
                            less developed countries are also concerned by the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> agricultural regulations. The
                            Chancellor commented that the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                            negotiations will bring forth some solid opposition to the <gloss
                                target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> regulations. The Chancellor said that
                            he is not afraid of this opposition and that he believes positive
                            results can be achieved.</p>
                        <p>Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> went on to say
                            that it is possible to get lost in details. Foodstuffs which affect the
                            entire world raise larger and more general problems; worldwide
                            agreements are called for. This however is contrary to the thinking of
                            the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. Nevertheless this is a
                            worldwide problem and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> is not the
                            only factor.</p>
                        <p>Regarding disparities the Chancellor said that the point is not their
                            number. Again there is a danger of being lost in detail, especially at
                            the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> conference. The Federal
                            Republic will pursue this problem in Brussels and with the United
                            States, on the basis of factual criteria. Then there will be a sound
                            basis for proceeding.</p>
                        <p>The Chancellor commented that there is not only the matter of the number
                            of items involved but also a difference of trade value. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> noted that economic criteria
                            had also been discussed at Brussels; complete information on the
                            criteria adopted at Brussels is not available and this information may
                            explain the difference in the number of disparities mentioned earlier in
                            the conversations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mike</hi>: First of all, let me thank you for
                            your extremely kind Christmas letter, which I appreciated deeply.
                            Certainly insofar as you <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0670"/>and
                            your family are concerned, I want to reciprocate every good wish for the
                            New Year and to express the hope that working together we can make real
                            progress in the field to which we are now devoting ourselves.</p>
                        <p>I have just returned from the meetings with Erhard at the LBJ Ranch in
                            Texas. My own participation in those meetings was limited to a short
                            morning session with <persName corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_WL5">Westrick</persName> and <persName

                            afternoon meeting with <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName>, et
                            al., at which there was considerable discussion with regard to the
                            progress of the Kennedy Round as well as the importance of what had
                            taken place in Brussels in relation to further political reunification
                            in Europe.</p>
                        <p>In the morning session, I had made it clear that the principal question
                            which we had to ask related to the German interpretation as to what had
                            taken place in Brussels, and whether or not the agricultural agreements,
                            as well as the disparity agreement which had been reached, were subject
                            to negotiation. In regard to the former, Westrick said he wished he
                            could give us a firm answer, but that this could not be done until the
                            Germans had themselves studied what had actually been decided upon in
                            Brussels. This they were unable to do because even Lahr (who was not
                            with the delegation) did not himself possess the text of their
                            agreements. For instance, Westrick cited the fact that during the last
                            hour of the conference, the Germans had offered some twelve amendments
                            to the mandate for the Commission, all of which he believed had been
                            accepted, but none of which were yet incorporated in any document. In
                            other words, it was very difficult for us even to approach any detail
                            since neither side was confident enough of the validity of what had been
                            reported to them to be able to discuss from texts. One very astounding
                            thing did develop, however. It was obvious (and this was confirmed in
                            the afternoon session) that the Germans were really very pleased at the
                            outcome of the Brussels meeting. They thought that the agreement on
                            disparities was a great step forward, with which we ought to be
                            delighted. It turned out, however, that they had been led to believe
                            that the new disparity formula would apply to only some 800 items for
                            the U.S. and 200 items for the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>,
                            whereas the 30-10 formula applied to over 1100 U.S. items and only a
                            handful of <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> items. They did not know
                            how these figures had been arrived at, nor whether the calculation was
                            made after the four trade criteria to be applied to the disparity
                            formula had been agreed to. Here we quickly found that there was no use
                            discussing the matter, since from our initial information these figures
                            made no sense whatever, and it would be impossible to discuss
                            disparities until agreement had been reached as to what we were talking
                            about. Furthermore, the Germans had no idea whatever that Switzerland
                            and other <gloss target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> countries were unhappy
                                <pb n="645" xml:id="pg_645" facs="0671"/>about the new formula. In
                            fact, our bringing out what seemed to be some obvious objections caused
                            a real dent in the euphoria which seemed to pervade the Germans as to
                            the over-all success at Brussels.</p>
                        <p>The afternoon session began with a long summary by <persName
                                corresp="#p_SG3">Schroeder</persName> as to what, in his opinion,
                            had been accomplished. This, I am sure, will be going forward to you as
                            soon as it has been written up by the State Department note takers. I
                            commented quite briefly on <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName>'s summary, saying that we had been rather
                            shaken in the accuracy of the reports we had received as to what had
                            been agreed upon when we found ourselves differing so widely with the
                            German delegation on the matter of disparities. I also commented on how
                            greatly we appreciated the position which the Germans had taken on
                            almost every issue, even though they had not always been successful in
                            carrying their point. I then referred to my real gratification at
                            Shroeder's remark that the agricultural decisions reached with regard to
                            rice, dairy products and meat were most certainly subject to negotiating
                            at Geneva, although as a practical matter I was sure that the Commission
                            would feel that it had no mandate to go any distance beyond the
                            preliminary agreement reached and the recommendations which would later
                            be adopted to implement those agreements. <persName corresp="#p_SG3"
                                >Schroeder</persName> then pointed out the importance which the
                            Germans attached to the so-called escape clause whereby a review of the
                            regulations became practically mandatory should third nation import
                            interests be seriously affected. None of us were too clear as to just
                            what that escape clause meant or how it would be interpreted by the
                            Commission, and it is obvious we will have to get some real
                            clarification on this point before too long.</p>
                        <p>After <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> had commented at
                            some length on the political implications of the Brussels agreements,
                            and expressed our satisfaction that they seemed to constitute a real
                            step forward toward unification, he then expressed our reservations on
                            detailed matters which could not be clearly expressed at this time
                            because of our inability to work from accurate knowledge as to what had
                            taken place. Then <persName corresp="#p_EL1">Erhard</persName> expressed
                            himself at considerable length, not alone on the political implications,
                            but on the general principals which had been adopted. He expressed some
                            doubt as to how far agreement will have been reached on grain prices by
                            April 15th. However, with regard to some of the matters on which we
                            obviously had serious reservations, he stated he was sure that other
                            nations would have similar reservations, mentioning in fact Great
                            Britain and the other Commonwealth countries and the <gloss
                                target="#t_EFTA1">EFTA</gloss> nations, and said that it would not
                            hurt his feelings if in Geneva there appeared concerted opposition to
                            some of those matters which the Germans themselves did not like which
                            would force a reconsideration by the Ministers of these agreements. This
                            was practically an open invitation to try to organize opposition to some
                            of the decisions of the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>, and my own
                                <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0672"/>interpretation of what he
                            said, confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName>,
                            was that this would also apply to possible agreement on grain prices
                            which might be fixed in April. This was, in my opinion, an extremely
                            important statement of his. I might add that when I was saying goodbye
                            to Erhard, he said that if, as he thought probable, we would have some
                            very difficult problems to resolve at a political level later on in
                            Geneva, he would himself be perfectly willing to come to Geneva again,
                            and while not taking part in official negotiations, sit in a back room
                            and try once again to play the role he played at the May Ministerial
                            meeting in Geneva.<note n="2" xml:id="d295fn2">See <ref target="#d282"

                        <p>In most of the above, there is not too much substance, except an
                            indication of a degree of flexibility with regard to the negotiations
                            which is, I think, really encouraging. However, throughout the whole
                            discussion De Gaulle's attitude was referred to several times and I am
                            certain that the Germans do not feel that the agreements reached in
                            Brussels have necessarily off-set the possibility of a disruptive
                            attitude by De Gaulle at a later date.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the knotty problem of agriculture, one thing emerged which
                            I hope you will give some thought to. <persName corresp="#p_EL1"
                                >Erhard</persName> himself referred to his own conviction that in
                            grains the outside world would continue to ship from 10 to 13 million
                            tons to the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> in the future regardless
                            of any increase of any grain production in France. He based this on the
                            continuing need for feed grains as the demand for meat continued to
                            increase. It occurred to me, although I have not mentioned this to
                            anyone except Roth and Hedges here, who both concur, that we might be
                            able to solve the access problem by linking the escape clause adopted to
                            a specific figure such as 10-13 million tons, so that action would
                            become mandatory by the Commission and the Council if the import of
                            grains fell below that figure. This, to my mind, would be infinitely
                            preferable to any effort to secure specific access quota, which as we
                            know would meet serious opposition on the part of the Commission, as
                            well as the French.</p>
                        <p>Before too long you will be hearing more from us on the subject of
                            agriculture, but we are having real difficulty in reconciling the
                            positions of Agriculture, State, and ourselves in order that we may have
                            a clear-cut Government line to follow.</p>
                        <p>There are two random thoughts which deserve some consideration on our
                            part. If, as now seems probable, the whole disparities issue becomes
                            more and more involved and unmanageable, we should be giving
                            consideration to the original Swedish proposal which, as I understand
                            it, would mean cuts of 50% in all tariffs of 30% or above, and would
                            then move down one percentage point with each point below 30, at which
                            tariffs now stand, ending up with a 25% cut at 5% or a 21% cut at <pb
                                n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0673"/>1%. According to our
                            computations, this would end up with a 39% over-all cut by the United
                            States and 35% by the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss>. It would, of
                            course, mean a smaller cut for the low tariff countries, but as between
                            ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_EEC1">EEC</gloss> would, I think, be
                            soluble politically in this country. Whether or not any of the trade
                            criterias could be applied to such a formula, I do not know, but its
                            very simplicity has a great appeal.</p>
                        <p>The second thought follows on top of the first. If we had a bottom cut
                            off of 5% a la ecretement and this were agreed to as a general rule,
                            except where perhaps a principal supplier wished to receive further
                            reductions below this level, we could then solve our oil problem. The
                            bright ideas which we advanced from the point of view of listing oil and
                            so getting it out of the exceptions category is not taking too well with
                            the Interior Department or the <gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss>.
                            Insofar as the principal supplier is concerned, this is clearly
                            Venezuela, which is not apt to join the <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss> negotiations. Canada supplies only 1/8th of our
                            imports.</p>
                        <p>Both of the above may be disturbing thoughts, but I think we ought to
                            give them a good going over.</p>
                        <p>You will undoubtedly have received a good deal more information than this
                            letter contains by cable before you receive it. However, it carries with
                            it all sorts of good wishes for your Japan trip as well as good luck in
                            the very important negotiations which will be taking place in Geneva
                            very soon thereafter. I doubt whether anything of profit could come out
                            of meetings in Geneva until after the Ministerial meeting in Brussels,
                            which I think is on January 15th, at which point there may be a good
                            deal of hassling as to what was really agreed to under the pressures of
                            last week.</p>
                        <p>If there is to be anything like a Ministerial meeting, please be sure to
                            set it after the last two weeks in February, since I have made a solemn
                            promise to take those two weeks off with my wife and this, as you know,
                            constitutes a much stronger obligation than any that might appertain to
                            the success of the <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> Round.
                            I am sure you understand.</p>

                        <p>In his Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union of
                            January 30, 1961, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> said that “we must never forget our hopes for
                            the ultimate freedom and welfare of the Eastern European peoples.” He
                            asked Congress to amend the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of
                            1951, commonly known as the Battle Act (P.L. 82-213, approved October
                            26, 1951; 65 Stat. 644), to allow him more discretion in using economic
                            tools “to help reestablish historic ties of friendship” with Eastern
                            Europe. He also said he hoped “to explore with the Polish Government the
                            possibility of using our frozen Polish funds on projects of peace that
                            will demonstrate abiding friendship for and interest in the people of
                            Poland.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the

                            State Bulletin, March 27, 1961, pages 444-445) The bill permitted grant
                            aid to any nation, excluding the Soviet Union and the Communist-held
                            areas of the Far East (Communist China, North Korea, and North Vietnam).
                            In his statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
                            support of the bill on April 25, Under Secretary of State for Economic
                            Affairs Ball referred to the possible use of accumulated Polish currency
                            as an example of such aid. (Ibid., May 22, 1961, pages 775-776) The
                            Senate amended and passed the bill on May 11 (S.1215, 82d Cong.). It was

                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> arising from advances in

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that while subsequent agreement had
                            been reached on some points, our delegations were still at odds with
                            respect to twenty-three items. He was disturbed that there had been no
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> discussion related to the <gloss

                            disagreement on the criteria. Sir Patrick said that there was real
                            disagreement but only with respect to the interpretation of the
                            criteria. He said that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> views differ
                            somewhat from those of the US with regard to the whole question of the
                            state of the Soviet technology—particularly in light of advances in
                            Soviet rocketry, whether an item should properly be on the munitions

                            and not yet in production. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> looks
                            at the last mentioned as a national security matter and not one for
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. An added problem for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> was under very great internal political pressure to
                            increase trade with the Soviets.</p>

                        <p>Sir Patrick said that they deplored the difference of opinion not so much
                            in terms of magnitude of trade but rather in terms of friction in
                                US/<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> relations, and they would very
                            much like to see a solution found. He suggested that the two countries
                            plan to get together bilaterally and at an appropriate level well in
                            advance of the next annual review. He added that he was not yet ready to
                            suggest a date for such a meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> agreed that it was desirable to have
                            bilateral talks before the next annual review. He thought that May or
                            June might be an appropriate time. By that time we would have completed
                            our review of US/Soviet bloc economic relations, and would be in a
                            better position to sit down with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            and discuss <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> policy.</p>
                        <p>Sir Patrick said, with respect to the current list review, that he hoped
                            both delegations could be instructed to make a big effort to find common
                            ground in order to avoid a US/UK clash. For their part, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> delegation was being instructed to meet
                            the US point of view wherever possible, even where in the delegation's
                            view the matter at hand was contrary to the criteria. He concluded by
                            saying that in the future he personally would keep a close eye on <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> developments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that he was encouraged by Sir
                            Patrick's statements, and that we too would provide further instructions
                            to our <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> delegation.<note n="2"

                        <p><hi rend="italic">As to the pending cases</hi>, I argued for approval
                            along the lines of your letter and Ed Martin's briefing memorandum. I
                            urged that the basic <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy guidance
                            should be followed, and emphasized in particular that we felt that cases
                            such as these should be looked at in terms of whether they would have a
                            substantial impact on the war-making potential of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the Soviet bloc. The question of
                            whether the same items were available elsewhere should be given
                            considerable weight. I said that I thought that if we embarked on a
                            policy with respect to trade which widened the gap in this area between
                            ourselves and our allies, there would be no compensating national
                            security interest which would be served. I <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652"
                                facs="0678"/>also mentioned that a negative position on these cases
                            would conflict with the Administration's general position of favoring
                            the expansion of peaceful trade. Finally, I said that it was very
                            important to rectify the present situation where there was considerable
                            uncertainty on the part of American businessmen and Soviet bloc
                            purchasers, as to what could be licensed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> referred to Ambassador
                            Thompson's telegram, and advised that he would be prepared to approve
                            the applications for transfermatic machines for automotive production,
                            on the understanding that (a) Defense's position was changed to one of
                            approval and (b) Defense advised Congressman Lipscomb of their change in
                            position. It appeared that Defense was ready to revise its position on
                            these machines.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the two cases for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            about which you wrote to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName> on March 27, 1961 (technical data re. nylon 66
                            and carbon bisulphide), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName> said that he would approve the license for the
                            latter, but that Commerce had a question on the former, and would want
                            to check further on Dupont's willingness to permit use of the
                            process.</p>
                        <p>On the case of the research equipment for Poland, Mac Bundy and I argued
                            at length for approval, on the grounds that this equipment would be for
                            research basically in non-military fields. The matter was left that the
                            Defense Department would take another look at its position, and if it
                            withdrew its objection to issuance of the license, Mr. Hodges indicated
                            he would approve.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">As to the future procedure</hi>, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> said that he was sending forward
                            a proposal to the President for an Executive Order, setting up a Board
                            of Export Review (to be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce with
                            participation at the Secretary level) to deal with all export license
                            cases in which there was disagreement among agencies in the present
                            interagency staff committees. His main concern was that the U.S.
                            Government act and speak as one on these matters. He emphasized that,
                            once a license was granted, it should not be revoked. He was also
                            anxious to set up a procedure which would ensure that agency's
                            reservations and dissents were thoroughly thrashed out, and agreement
                            reached on a case. He wanted to end the practice where an agency's
                            non-concurrence with a decision was noted for the record, but not
                            pursued (except perhaps at a later date, as in the ball bearing case).
                            He also said that he thought we should have no more instances where
                            agency's views on cases under review were ventilated to the Congress or
                            the press. There was no disagreement with these objectives.</p>
                        <p>There was considerable discussion as to whether the proposed Board of
                            Export Review would operate by unanimous or majority vote, and it was
                            the consensus that agreement would have to be unanimous (in view of the
                            right of access of Cabinet officers to the President), with all <pb

                            thought that there would only be about four cases a year which would
                            have to be reviewed by the Board, but I rather think that, on the basis
                            of the Department's past experience with Defense and Commerce, we would
                            have more cases than that. There seems, however, some promise of a new
                            viewpoint on these matters in Defense, which should make the Board's and
                            the President's task easier. In any event, I told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> that the Department would want
                            to be given an early opportunity to review the proposed Executive Order
                            to set up such a Board. We are arranging to obtain copies of the draft
                            Order.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6">Feldman</persName> said a revised order
                            would be distributed and he hoped it could be issued early next
                            week.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of this discussion Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> said he wanted White House views
                            on the question of publicity for licenses. He was under heavy pressure
                            from Congressman Moss to provide routine publicity on the name of the
                            company, product and country of destination for all of the 12,000
                            licenses issued each month. After sampling business opinion and securing
                            views from State and Treasury, Commerce had agreed that such a routine
                            publication should not be made. There was a serious problem of releasing
                            competitively valuable information. There was also the problem that many
                            companies feared local public opinion if it became known they were
                            selling to bloc countries. Trade might dry up materially. It was pointed
                            out that such license information is highly misleading since in the case
                            of bloc countries it is usually a “fishing license” and 70% of the
                            licenses are not followed by shipments. Commerce has no information on
                            actual shipments so could not publish these only. The consensus of the
                            group was to support Commerce but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FM6"
                                >Feldman</persName> had reservations, feeling substantially that the
                            competitive argument was not important and you should release anything
                            which there were no strong reasons for concealing. It was understood, of
                            course, that such information would always be made available to
                            Committees of Congress on a confidential basis and the companies were
                            always free to release information if they chose. It was agreed that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> would prepare a
                            document on the subject and discuss it with Mr. Salinger.</p>

                                <item>Bundy apologized profusely when told that the letter to

                                    dispatched in spite of the fact that there had been a Laos cease
                                    fire since May 11. He stated he recognized, in response to my
                                    comment, that this was rather a peculiarly political condition
                                    for Defense to have established but said it was proposed to his
                                    Secretary on a day when the Laotian situation was quite critical
                                    and his Secretary had accepted it.</item>

                                    letter from Bundy on synthetic rubber2 and stated that Secretary
                                        <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> was not
                                    willing to approve on the basis of such a letter with its very
                                    grudging approval from a Defense standpoint. We persuaded Bundy
                                    that the letter did contain phrases which could be taken out of
                                    context and used to seriously embarrass politically the
                                    Secretary of Commerce. Bundy agreed to withdraw the letter and
                                    redraft it confining his comment to saying that any larger
                                    quantities would raise difficulties. On this basis <persName

                                <item><persName corresp="#p_BJN1">Behrman</persName> discussed a
                                    Defense letter on a boiler for the Soviet Union to be shipped by
                                    the Canadian subsidiary of a US company in which Defense had
                                    argued against the shipment but then agreed to approve it in
                                    view of the Canadian angle.<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">Not
                                        found.</note> I concurred in feeling this was a very
                                    unfortunate letter to have in the files. Bundy agreed that he
                                    would not have recommended denial on the basis of the technical
                                    arguments contained in the letter and, therefore, the Canadian
                                    angle was irrelevant. <persName corresp="#p_BJN1"
                                        >Behrman</persName> agreed to see that the license was

                            </list></p>
                        <p>There was also some general discussion of Defense comments on the
                            proposed Commerce instructions to examining officers and the way the
                            burden of proof problem should be handled. This was somewhat
                            inconclusive but it was generally agreed that the US strategic list
                            should be reexamined and that presumption of denial should only mean
                            that the burden of proof is on the applicant or agency who seek
                            approval, not that such cases would normally or usually be denied. A
                            particularly valid reason for granting such licenses would be
                            availability from other sources. There was also a brief discussion of
                            the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> situation and of the review

                            licensing policy. Such action has been under consideration for some

                        <p>It is difficult to anticipate quantitative effect of liberalization since
                            number of factors would influence bloc purchases from US. In general,

                        <p>In exercising licensing authority Commerce will observe reasonable
                            safeguards to assure that these commodities are not transshipped to
                            Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam and Cuba. Where evidence
                            indicates strong likelihood of transshipment to such destinations, will
                            not approve licenses. Exporters will be required to supply commitments
                            from importers in the bloc countries that the commodities will not be
                            reexported to another destination. However, it is recognized that
                            maintenance of effective destination control with respect to these
                            countries poses certain practical difficulties. In any event, in
                            considering licenses Commerce will take into account quantities involved
                            in relation to requirements of country concerned, insofar as can be
                            determined. Any possible applications for East Germany would of course
                            be disposed of in accordance with established US policy toward East
                            Germany.</p>

                            countries. The comments of House members on H. Res. 403 are recorded on

                            Resolution can, perhaps, be correctly interpreted as motivated in some
                            measure by “political antagonisms” or “recrimination” against the
                            Administration—perhaps influenced by the Rules Committee battle early in
                            this session of Congress; and perhaps influenced by other factors such
                            as the redistricting of a Congressional District in North Carolina to
                            the disadvantage of the present incumbent who introduced Resolution No.

                            these political factors, I would now set them to one side. It would be a
                            very serious mistake for us to attribute this development in the
                            Congress to purely “political factors.” We should now dwell on what I
                            consider to be the crux of the case so far as the Administration is
                            concerned; that is, the facts and merits regarding the administration of
                            the Export Control Act during the past several months.</p>

                        <p>So far <hi rend="italic">as announced</hi> formal policy on exports to
                            Soviet bloc countries, the Administration has pretty much continued to
                            “do business as usual,” notwithstanding the Berlin developments. We have
                            continued to author-ize exports of non-strategic goods to the Soviet
                            Union and her satellites with the only announced policy change in recent
                            months having to do with subsidized agricultural products, a decision
                            which was made prior to the present Berlin crisis.</p>
                        <p>Our <hi rend="italic">unannounced</hi> policy has been stricter than we
                            have told the Congress and the public. Congressman Bloomfield (page
                            17444 of the Record) makes the categorical statement we are actually
                            shipping subsidized agricultural products. Even though we are not,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and I in conference
                            with various Congressmen refused to say we would not ship. As Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> will recall, I felt weeks
                            ago we should announce publicly that we would not ship subsidized
                            agricultural products to the Soviet bloc. However, we have withheld such

                            We must recognize that our decision not to announce that we would
                            definitely not ship subsidized agricultural commodities to the Soviet
                            bloc countries has contributed to the Congressional sentiment with

                            hears—comparing our export policy with the Berlin developments and the
                            action taken in recent weeks to strengthen our military forces.</p>

                            knowledge and approval of the President. We have authorized shipment of
                            subsidized agricultural commodities to Poland, but this has been under
                            express statutory authority of Congress (Public Law 480).<note n="4"

                            their own trade policies, and to the great desirability of trying to
                            obtain unity of action among the Western allies. It may be that resolute
                            and determined action on the part of the United States (at the highest
                            level) against continued trade with Soviet bloc countries would have a

                            the Export Control Act. We, of course, want to (1) make decisions on
                            specific license applications which are not now and will not later prove
                            to be against the national interest; and (2) apart from the actual
                            merits of individual decisions, we must try to administer the law in

                            undesirable changes will be made in the law at the next session which
                            could have the effect of greatly restricting desirable flexibility now

                                for U.S. components of items produced abroad for export to the
                                Soviet bloc countries and Poland. <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                    >Rusk</persName> stated that extension of U.S. controls ran “the
                                risk that the adverse effect upon our relations with our friends and
                                allies would outweigh the advantages to be gained.” He suggested
                                that the Advisory Committee on Export Policy discuss <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>' proposals and then he would
                                like to consider them again from the standpoint of foreign policy.
                                (Ibid., 400.119/10-361)</note> on my proposal to institute improved
                            export controls regarding the use abroad of United States exports in

                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> an identical letter

                            concurring in the proposal and offering assistance in the technical

                                xml:id="d303fn2">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>At this time, however, I do wish to clarify several apparent
                            misunderstandings which are reflected in your letter.</p>
                        <p>You appear to have been advised that present United States controls
                            already “afford us a large measure of protection” in this problem area.
                            To the contrary, I have found that controls governing such misuse of
                            United States exports have been so tightly drawn in the past as to have
                            little real application and to have been so inadequately disseminated as
                            to be unknown to broad areas of the United States and international
                            trading community. These are additional underlying reasons why I
                            consider the present situation to be untenable and to require prompt
                            action to improve and extend such controls.</p>
                        <p>Your letter also implies that the purpose of this effort is “to impose
                            the United States level of controls, beyond Coordinating Committee
                            (CoCom) controls, on non-U.S. origin goods.” This was certainly not my
                            intent, and I do not know on what basis such a statement is made. Had
                            such been my intent, I would have clearly so indicated in setting forth
                            in my initial letter the reasons which led me to initiate a further
                            control effort. As you know, the Export Control Act of 1949 (as amended)
                            is not dependent upon the activities of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> although, in many instances, particular United States
                            controls are to varying degrees made ineffective by the absence of
                            supporting controls by CoCom. The present control problem is one which
                            has been examined within the Department of Commerce at various times
                            over many years. A principal reason for the inadequacy of past controls
                            in this area appears to have been the inability to absorb a significant
                            increase in license application workload under past staffing conditions.
                            I feel that I must undertake such additional controls as are needed to
                            carry out the basic objectives of the Act and must somehow find the
                            means to handle such additional workload as may be involved in
                            fulfilling that responsibility. I take this stand not only in matters
                            involving the national security but equally in implementing important
                            foreign policy objectives and in protecting the domestic economy in
                            short supply situations. My first priority in the present effort is to
                            ensure that our exports are not used abroad to frustrate the intent of
                            that Act and <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0689"/>our policies
                            thereunder. I hope these statements will dispel the faulty understanding
                            of my intent reflected in your letter.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, you have noted, I have already recognized that my proposal has
                            foreign policy implications. The basic adverse impact, of course, falls
                            on United States firms, United States subsidiaries and licensees abroad
                            and certain other Free World firms. Some of the adverse reaction of
                            these groups may well spill over into the foreign policy field. If there
                            are truly serious disadvantages to the proposal from a foreign policy
                            standpoint, let us examine them fully in the course of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ACEP1">ACEP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ECRB1"
                                >ECRB</gloss> discussions of the proposal. Since the proposal
                            basically concerns the promotion of our national security, I hope that
                            there will be no request to modify the proposed program to any serious
                            extent except on the basis of quite clear evidence of significant
                            adverse impact on truly important United States foreign policies.</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary of Commerce Gudeman opened the presentation by calling
                            attention to the tables in the secret report submitted by Commerce
                            entitled US Economic Relations with the Soviet Bloc.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d304fn1">Dated January 2; a copy is filed with the source

                            $18,834 million of which only $193.4 million were to Eastern Europe. The
                            largest portion—$143.1 million—was to Poland and this was due to the
                            PL-480 arrangement. Russia itself <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664"
                                facs="0690"/>accounted for $38.4 million. On the import side, total
                            US imports amounted to $14,654 million of which $80.9 million or
                            six-tenths of one per cent, were from Eastern Europe. The tables show
                            that the bulk of the imports from the bloc come from Czechoslovakia,
                            Poland and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and that they
                            consisted chiefly of meat and meat products, furs, glass and glass
                            products, platinum and benzine. Leading US exports to the bloc were
                            wheat, barley, cotton, iron and steel mill products, and textile,
                            sewing, and shoe machinery. Another table shows the various countries
                            and what they get from and ship to the bloc, indicating dependence on
                            the bloc by some of these nations.</p>

                                >Behrman</persName> then made the major presentation. He thought
                            discussion should focus on three major things: a) the assumptions on
                            which we base our activities with the bloc; b) the policy objectives we
                            hope to achieve; and c) specific techniques we might employ to achieve
                            these objectives.</p>

                                do this will increase. We thus face a different sort of problem in

                                >Behrman</persName> called attention to the objectives as listed on
                            page 4 of the above-mentioned report. He noted particularly the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>To support the growth of free international trade and to maintain such
                            trade on a fair and competitive basis.</p>
                        <p>To accelerate the economic growth and maintain the economic preeminence
                            of the US and its Allies.</p>
                        <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0691"/>
                        <p>To promote sound and progressive economic and political growth of the
                            newly emergent free nations and of friendly less-developed
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>To maintain the preeminence of the US and its Allies in technological and
                            scientific research, development and production.</p>
                        <p>These and the other objectives can be narrowed down to specific
                            objectives which may point the way on techniques.</p>
                        <p>To try to force the Soviet bloc to trade on our terms (i.e. on an open
                            market basis). We can do this better by waiting for them to come to us
                            than by our seeking them out.</p>
                        <p>To provide an alternative to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s to
                            trading with the bloc. This might involve commodity stabilization
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>To achieve a maximum agreement on controls by <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries on trade with the bloc.</p>
                        <p>To establish a means of relieving the burden on the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s and others caused by any interdiction
                            of trade coming out of situations such as that in Berlin. (This would
                            apply to countries other than <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s such
                            as Italy, Greece, Iceland, Turkey, and Yugoslavia.)</p>

                                >Behrman</persName> then outlined a number of techniques which might
                            be employed to obtain these objectives.</p>

                            <item>We should try again in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to
                                get agreement on trading rules with the Soviet bloc. We should
                                decide whether there is any hope of the Russians trading according
                                to rules not incompatible with Western practices.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Commerce feels it is necessary to continue very strong pressure on
                                    <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> to maximize the area of
                                agreement or we will have to relax our unilateral controls. We must
                                also consider whether there should be revision of Treasury controls
                                of subsidiaries in Western Europe and whether we want to exercise
                                control over them. These things must be examined, keeping in mind
                                what the effect of such pressure and controls on subsidiaries would
                                be on our relations with our Allies.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>We should consider whether we are directing our control efforts in
                                the wrong area. What Russia wants is capital equipment and
                                technology, and we may have been putting too much emphasis on
                                specific commodity imports rather than on technological data,
                                including transfer of the latter from Western Europe. We may not
                                have paid enough attention to component parts. We have perhaps not
                                been sufficiently attuned to the matter of prototypes and samples.
                                In considering this, Commerce thinks we need studies of the
                                technological aspects of some industries and the uses made of
                                technology in bloc countries. For example, Commerce found that a
                                substantial part of the licenses for Yugoslavia are for electronic
                                materials. We do not know what Yugoslavia is doing in electronics.
                                Commerce has begun a study.</item>

                            <item>We should consider relaxing our unilateral controls of items not
                                controlled multilaterally.</item>

                                terms of Cuba and Latin American countries. We are studying
                                integrating all countries into one system instead of having classes
                                of countries. We haven't had the same ability to check on shipments

                            industrial items that are not so directly related to strategic uses. He
                            was thinking of a broader base of controls on such things as plant
                            prototypes which the bloc could later send to the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BJN1"
                                >Behrman</persName> said that it seemed to him that we should get
                            the maximum multilateral agreement we can on controls and then minimize
                            the negative aspect of our controls, putting as much positive emphasis
                            as we can on peaceful trade, such as consumer goods, and try to push
                            through trade rules that open the way to this trade for us. In other
                            words, we should tighten up on the technological data but loosen up in
                            the other area.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Trade Terms</hi>. With respect to Mr <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJN1">Behrman</persName>'s remark about forcing the bloc
                            to trade on free market terms, the question was asked whether we had not
                            tried that. It was stated that this had been pushed at the end of World
                            War II and discussed in 1956, but it did not get anywhere.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that the State Department did a very
                            thorough study on this last spring for the White House.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d304fn2">Reference presumably is to the paper entitled “US
                                Economic Relations with the Soviet Bloc;” for text, see vol. V, <ref

                            stumbling block has been how to persuade the Soviets to desert their
                            dogmas to do this.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Motivation for Soviet Trade</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> stressed on several occasions
                            that trade with the bloc is not trading in the commercial sense, that we
                            are dealing with a political system, and that the trade will have
                            political consequences for the West. When we sell Russia packaged
                            know-how in a non-military area, Russia can pull its people off this
                            research and put them to work on missiles. Moreover, our trade enables
                            the bloc to penetrate the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s more
                            successfully. They use our prototypes to manufacture plants which they
                            can then offer to the <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> noted that while a great deal of Soviet
                            interest in trade is political, there seems to be some interest in trade
                            for economic benefits. Soviet economists seem to be leaning now to the
                            view that they can benefit from foreign trade and see some future in it
                            for their country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that so far as we
                            can tell there is mixed motivation on the part of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The commercial is one component
                            (particularly with Western Europe). Another component is economic
                            warfare objectives; another, building up their war machine; and still
                            another, improving their relations with the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s. In shaping up a policy we, in concert with our
                            Western Allies, should try to see what we can do to counter the
                            components which are not commercial in character but not counter those
                            which are commercial.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Attitude of our Allies</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> observed that there are obvious
                            limits to what we can obtain from the Western trading nations in the way
                            of agreement on controls of trade with the bloc. It will be the least
                            common denominator of their appreciation of the problem. If we talk
                            about departing from the strategic concept and getting into a concept
                            that has to be redefined as the mobilization base or something more than
                            that, we have to consider the realities of getting agreement on it.
                            Unilateral action by the US is hopeless.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that when he was in London he talked
                            with the bankers and they could not understand our viewpoint. They have
                            been trading with Russia for years and think they are getting the best
                            of the deal. They see nothing but a commercial proposition. British
                            officials are coming here next month to talk with us about trade
                            controls and they will take the attitude that since this is a missile
                            age, the controls we are asking are no longer relevant. This City of
                            London view is typical of the view all over Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that the conditions
                            on each side of the Atlantic are quite different. Our dependence on our
                            exports is very low. We are concerned about our balance of payments, but
                            we are not in as desperate straits as the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> where everything depends on trade. We must recognize
                            that there is a difference in approach. To the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>, trade with the bloc is important to its ability to
                            live. To the US, it is a drop in the bucket. To them, it is asking a lot
                            to give up trade with the bloc; to us, it is nothing.</p>
                        <p>Asked if the British did not realize that they would be building up the
                            bloc so that it would compete with them in some instances, Mr.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> said this did not trouble them. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has been doing business that way
                            for centuries. It sold textile machinery until now it has to get out of
                            textile manufacturing itself. The British just regard that as
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> asked whether the
                            British recognize, apart from the military consequences of strategic
                            items, that they enable the Soviets to beat us in the less-developed
                            countries and the consequences of this from the <pb n="668"
                                xml:id="pg_668" facs="0694"/>free world standpoint. Mr.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> replied that the British think that the
                            Soviets can squeeze out what they need for this purpose in any case.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Elements Which US Must Consider</hi>. Getting back to
                            the basic issue of whether we should try to trade with the bloc or cut
                            off trade, Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said that we should weigh the
                            value of what we get from the bloc and what the value of trade is to the
                            bloc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said two things should be
                            considered: First, what does the Soviet Union get out of trade in terms
                            of technical knowhow and goods? Second, what advantage does it get out
                            of trade as pure economic warfare—the ability to disrupt markets and to
                            penetrate the economies of other countries? There is some advantage to
                            keeping these two things separate as they are really quite
                            different.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> said that if there were

                            taking these and other things into consideration, he would feel more
                            secure about developing more trade with the bloc. We need a coordinated
                            free world approach to the problem of trade and economic relations with
                            the Sino-Soviet bloc or with any of its individual components.</p>

                            The split looks deep and it may be long-term. We have not drawn

                                    it would be helpful if I were to set forth and circulate the
                                    decision taken by the President in the meeting which I arranged
                                    with him and which you attended January 24, 1962 following a
                                    meeting of the Export Control Review Board on January 23. In the
                                    meeting with the President it was agreed that the decision of
                                    August 25 to tighten up in the application of the strategic
                                    criteria had been carried farther than the President wished at
                                    this time. He felt that the type of proposed denials under
                                    review by the Export Control Board indicated a trend toward the
                                    application of export control criteria which went farther than
                                    he thought desirable.” <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                        >Ball</persName> suggested that “we should return to the

                                    potential only, as was done prior to August 25.” (Ibid.) No

                                    controls we have had on the items going to the Soviet Bloc,
                                    leaving the judgment and decision as to what is to be approved
                                    up to us, of course. He intimated that the situation was
                                    somewhat improved, and that we might safely, until further
                                    notice, pursue this policy.” (Memorandum from <persName

                        <p>I think your letter goes much too far in indicating that there was an
                            agreement which would return us to judging license applications under
                            criteria related only to the Bloc's war-making potential.</p>
                        <p>You refer to a meeting with the President on January 24. George, you know
                            this meeting, which was not over one minute's duration, did not lay any
                            facts before the President, except that you and I wanted to get his
                            quick thinking on whether we should relax our controls in view of the
                            apparent easing of tensions with the Soviet.</p>
                        <p>I confirmed to the President later the following paragraph: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"Our Administration's policy on export licenses to these areas is
                                    still not as clear-cut as I'd like to see it, but following your
                                    suggestion the other day (meaning January 24), we are relenting
                                    somewhat on the tight scrutiny we had been employing for the
                                    last few months.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I do not think that this gives any reason for your taking and circulating
                            it that we had agreed with the President on any new approaches.</p>
                        <p>May I suggest that we review completely the criteria which should guide
                            us. Meanwhile, I am still holding up certain requests for licenses <pb
                                n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0697"/>on carbon black, tire cord and
                            fabrics, and other items recently recommended for approval by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ACEP1">ACEP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Since the responsibility for making the final decision on licenses rests
                            with the Secretary of Commerce, I would like to say that I believe the
                            Secretary or his representative should be present when any discussions
                            are had on the policy affecting export licenses, so that we can be of
                            one mind as to the criteria employed under our controls and, equally
                            important, as to what is said and done publicly. We must keep in mind
                            that we publicize these licenses daily, and remember that the two
                            investigating committees of Congress are maintaining close scrutiny of
                            these lists. In this connection, I would like to say that before we
                            change radically any approval of licenses, it would be our idea to
                            notify in writing both of the congressional committees as to what we are
                            doing.</p>

                        <p>Representatives of the US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> held
                            bilateral talks on East-West trade controls in Washington February
                            19-23. Discussion centered around interpretation of the embargo criteria
                            of the Coordinating Committee on Export Control (<gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>). The British put forth three
                            principles which they would like to have accepted in the interest of
                            uniform interpretation of the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            embargo criteria. Application of these principles, in the British view,
                            would lead to a reduction of at least 50% in the coverage of
                            International List I (embargo).</p>
                        <p>The British were very anxious to have further technical discussion on
                            their proposed interpretive principles as they applied to particular
                            items, despite lack of full agreement on the principles themselves. The

                            the US took the opportunity to make additional representations for

                        <p>The discussions began with an exchange of views on Western objectives in
                            economic relations with the Soviet bloc. The <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> expressed agreement that certain aspects of East-West
                            trade should be approached with caution and that certain controls are
                            needed. These controls, however, must continue to make practical sense
                            in light of the current assumptions of nuclear war and the latest
                            estimates of the bloc's economic capacity.</p>
                        <p>The British representative said that his Government was prepared to
                            accept the existing criteria and was not raising any question about the
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> Atomic Energy List,
                            Munitions List or the existing arrangements for military and commercial
                            security; but the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government believes
                            that International List I is out of date in important respects as it now
                            stands and could be substantially reduced both as to number of items and
                            their scope. The British noted the considerable differences in approach
                            between our two governments at the last <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> List Review and expressed a desire to avoid a
                            repetition of such a dispute at the List Review commencing in May.</p>
                        <p>The British argued that, in light of their domestic political pressures,
                            it was necessary for <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> controls to
                            be “defensible in terms of the latest strategic thinking which included
                            general and lively insistence that a healthy economy is the cornerstone
                            of our defenses.” In this regard, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            suggested three principles for interpretation of the strategic
                            criteria.</p>
                        <p>First, the British believe that the common pattern of use of a product,
                            rather than the alleged pattern of use in the Soviet bloc, should
                            determine whether it is to be regarded as of principally military
                            application. A particular type of equipment should not be embargoed
                            merely because its use in the bloc is believed to be mainly military.
                            The bloc use may be predominantly military because in these countries
                            military needs come first and there may not be enough of the equipment
                            to meet civilian requirements as well. The only logical way to judge a
                            case, in the British view, is by reference to the pattern of use in
                            industrialized countries generally. An example of this principle is the
                            use of electronic computers.</p>
                        <p>The second principle the British advanced is that the importance of an
                            item should be taken into account as well as its description in
                            evaluating <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0699"/>it against the
                            criteria. What really matters is the current significance of the item in
                            waging war or in producing military equipment. The type of thing the
                            British have in mind here is jacketed containers for storage of
                            liquefied gases.</p>
                        <p>Their final principle is that the control of equipment should be relaxed
                            when such equipment has been in normal commercial use for so long that
                            the “know-how” could be considered common property. The British believe
                            there are a number of items, especially in the electronics category,
                            which become less and less important strategically as commercial uses
                            grow. After a certain period, say two to four years, varying with the
                            type of equipment, any embargo loses its justification.</p>

                        <p>The US was able to agree to a considerable extent with the <gloss

                                    the pattern of use in the most nearly comparable Western

                                    continue to be embargoed and whether the use of a time period
                                    cut-off is appropriate.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Following discussion of individual points made by the US, the British
                            representative reached the conclusion that the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> could agree with much of what we said. But there were
                            still a number of unresolved issues. We do not believe that we can
                            prepare for the contingency of nuclear war to the exclusion of extended
                            large-scale conventional warfare. Later high-level discussion of this
                            important policy issue through other channels is planned. The US could
                            not go along with the British view that the pattern of use of an item in
                            the Western industrialized countries rather than the possible use in the
                            Soviet bloc should determine military use under the present <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> criteria. Finally, we could not
                            defend anything approaching a 50% reduction in the number of embargoed
                            items on List I.</p>
                        <p>The US representative noted that we are approaching the 1962 <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List Review as an “up-dating” of
                            the list to reflect advances in technology and changes in the Soviet
                            bloc supply situation as it bears on military production. We assume that
                            this is likely to result in a few additions, <pb n="674" xml:id="pg_674"
                                facs="0700"/>a few deletions, and possibly somewhat more numerous
                            redefinitions which cannot be clearly characterized as one or the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>This approach is not, in our thinking, different in concept from that
                            which governed in the last two annual <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> reviews. While we do not visualize a major extension
                            of the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list on the one hand,
                            neither do we contemplate a major contradiction as proposed by the

                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Pipe Embargo Discussed</hi></p>
                        <p>Apart from the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list talks,
                            discussions were also held on the US proposal now before <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for an embargo on oil pipe and
                            equipment. Emphasis was placed on the potential effectiveness of such an
                            embargo since both sides agreed that differences in the assessment of
                            the military importance of the pipeline system rested on differing
                            concepts of the types of possible warfare. An agreed US-<gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-French military position on the
                            significance of Soviet pipelines is expected to be reached in talks
                            beginning March 12 to develop annual intelligence estimates for <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning.</p>
                        <p>The British argued that a pipe embargo would not be effective since by
                            putting aside the construction of gas lines, which represent about half
                            of Soviet pipe requirements, the Soviets could finish oil lines from
                            their own resources without delay. Our representative replied that data
                            on Soviet pipe production were too sketchy; that we should not assume
                            the Soviets would abandon already begun gas lines; that major adjustment
                            of planning always resulted in delays; and that the inclusion of pumps,
                            valves, fittings, and other related equipment in the embargo would
                            increase Soviet difficulties and the probability of delay. We informed
                            the British that we feel strongly about a pipe embargo and thought that
                            other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries were prepared to
                            agree to such an embargo if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            changed its position.</p>
                        <p>The British representative promised to report our views to his Government
                            but doubted that the British position will change. He understood that
                            the British Ministers were not prepared to accept any additions to the
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> embargo list unless reasons
                            therefor are especially strong.</p>

                        <p>We have had continuing differences with the Department of Commerce on
                            export control matters for close to a year. These differences are making
                            it increasingly difficult to conduct day-to-day business on an efficient
                            basis. Significant policy divergences are involved.</p>
                        <p>These divergences were reviewed briefly with the President on January 24
                            when it was agreed that the tightened application of the strategic
                            criteria undertaken in August 1961 could be eased. The Department of
                            Commerce has not, however, made any significant change in its pattern of
                            export licensing actions.</p>
                        <p>Thus there appears to be frustration on all sides; Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> would like to operate under a
                            tighter control policy, but, since he does not have agreement on it, has
                            done nothing but to hold cases he thinks should be denied; the Commerce
                            staff and the interagency advisory committee, operating under the
                            existing policy guidelines, continue to recommend approval for cases
                            which they know Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>
                            will not approve; American businessmen are frequently unable to get a
                            decision of any kind; and the State Department is left in the difficult
                            situation of representing to other countries a policy which does not
                            exist in fact.</p>
                        <p>These problems fall into two parts—policy issues and licensing case
                            questions.</p>

                        <p>The basic policy issue is that Commerce would replace the present
                            long-standing policy of selective export controls with the policy of
                            economic warfare against the Soviet bloc going far beyond the control of
                            strategic exports. Commerce has made its views explicit in a proposed

                        <p>While the Department has recognized the need to provide on a contingent
                            basis for tightening trade controls against the Soviet bloc, in
                            collaboration with our allies, in response to specific Soviet actions or
                            threatened actions, this is quite a different thing from embracing a
                            policy of continuous economic warfare. To do the latter would almost
                            completely ignore the positive side of our East-West policy—to seek
                            through peaceful means to develop as broad a range of contacts as
                            possible between the Soviet bloc nations and the West, to encourage
                            greater independence of action on the part of the Soviet-dominated
                            countries of Eastern Europe, and to increase American influence in that
                            area. A policy of selective trade relations has contributed and still
                            can contribute to the attainment of this aim of penetration in the
                            countries of the Soviet bloc. The actions that would follow from the
                            Commerce Department's revised statement of economic defense policy
                            would, in the unlikely event the policy were supported by Western
                            industrialized countries, serve instead to tighten and to extend
                            economic interdependence within the Soviet bloc by further limiting
                            relationships between the bloc countries and the free societies of the
                            West. The effect would be to lessen the stake of the Eastern European
                            countries in relaxing tensions with the West. A policy of very greatly
                            expanded trade controls would seem particularly pointless in light of

                            European industrial states and Japan such a policy would have only a
                            comparatively limited immediate impact on the Soviet bloc and a marginal
                            effect on its long-term growth.</p>
                        <p>Within the basic policy divergence, there are several specific issues:
                            There are differences with respect to the present strategic criteria,
                            Commerce wishing to reinterpret and amend them to bring a wider range of
                            items, including clearly non-strategic items, under embargo. Such a
                            change would greatly complicate our negotiating problems in <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>. Commerce would also propose to
                            follow a general rule of denying U.S. exports “regardless of whether it
                            is demonstrated that the same kinds of items are available to the Soviet
                            bloc from other countries”. This policy would penalize American
                            businessmen and the American economy without having any impact on the
                            Soviet bloc. Along the same lines, Commerce wants to tighten U.S.
                            controls over advanced technology, even in the non-strategic area,
                            including controls over its use by friendly countries. Finally, Commerce
                            proposes greatly tightening controls over trade with Poland presumably
                            based on the assumption that Polish assurances concerning re-exports
                            cannot be considered valid.</p>

                        <p>The particular cases which have been held by the Secretary of Commerce
                            are illustrative of the policy differences described above. These cases
                            fall into three broad categories—cases related to the tire industry (Tab
                            G), cases related to the petrochemical industry (Tab H), and cases
                            involving technical data (Tab I). They were all discussed at the
                            Advisory Committee on Export Policy (<gloss target="#t_ACEP1"
                                >ACEP</gloss>) meeting of February 8.</p>
                        <p>In a number of cases the <gloss target="#t_ACEP1">ACEP</gloss> Chairman,
                            with the concurrence of all members, recommended approval. In other
                            cases the <gloss target="#t_ACEP1">ACEP</gloss> Chairman deferred
                            recommendation pending clarification of the petrochemical policy and of
                            the technical data policy (in actual fact pending review of basic
                            economic defense policy). The Secretary of Commerce, however, has not
                            yet authorized the issuance of export licenses for the cases recommended
                            for approval; nor has further action been taken on the cases de-ferred
                            for policy clarification. Since some of these cases date back as far as
                            August 1961, there have been increasing complaints from American
                            businessmen over their inability to get action of any kind.</p>

                            have come up for discussion in the Operating Committee (<gloss
                                target="#t_OC1">OC</gloss>). Final decision on these cases should be
                            consistent with the action taken on the earlier cases in the respective
                            categories, and these cases have therefore been held for <gloss

                        <p>State has likewise appealed denial recommendations on two other cases not
                            falling into any of the foregoing categories. One involves
                            interpretation by Commerce of the <gloss target="#t_ECRB1">ECRB</gloss>
                            decision of January 23, regarding pulp and paper machinery, in a manner
                            broader than was believed intended by the <gloss target="#t_ECRB1"
                                >ECRB</gloss> (Tab J). The other involves denial of a commodity of a
                            non-strategic type simply because other types in the same chemical
                            family are strategic, an action inconsistent with established licensing
                            guidelines (Tab K). In all cases correct application of the established
                            licensing guidelines (Tab E) would result in approval.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Department of State and Commerce have had recurring differences
                            during the past year over the licensing of exports to the European
                            Communist bloc. There are now pending and we are in disagreement with
                            regard to a number of applications for licenses to ship commodities and
                            equipment to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and to other
                            Eastern European countries.</p>
                        <p>Neither these applications as a group nor our total trade with the bloc
                            are quantitatively important. The dollar value of the goods represented
                            by the applications is approximately $2,400,000. Our total sales to the
                            European Soviet bloc in 1961 came to $133,000,000, of which sales to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> amounted to $42,600,000.
                            Nevertheless, trade is an instrument of our over-all policy toward the
                            bloc and export licensing should be consistent with that policy.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the pending license applications should be approved. The
                            articles and equipment covered by the applications qualify for approval
                            under our policy and the licensing criteria developed under that policy
                            (see Enclosures 1 and 2). That is, either they are non-strategic by our
                            own definitions or the items themselves and the know-how involved are
                            available to the Soviet bloc in the same or substantially the same form
                            from Western Europe or Japan. If we were to deny the applications, it
                            would have negligible consequences for the material strength of the
                            Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>There is another and I think a decisive point involved. Denial of these
                            applications would work at cross purposes with our attempt to establish
                            sober communications with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            the Eastern European bloc. The underlying premise for our export control
                            policy has been, of course, that trade is one of the few means for
                            influencing the <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0705"/>peoples of the
                            Soviet Union toward a national attitude that will tend to make the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a more responsible and
                            peaceful member of the international community. I developed this premise
                            at some length before Representative Kitchin's Subcommittee last
                            October. I think that it remains the soundest basis for export control
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>This is all the more so because the Russians appear to attach a
                            psychological importance to our export control procedures that is quite
                            disproportionate to the small amounts at issue. There is a tendency,
                            unfounded as it may seem to us, for the Soviets to view our operations
                            in the field of trade as indicators of our over-all attitudes. At a time
                            when we are engaged in a series of diplomatic discussions with the
                            Soviets about Berlin and other matters, nothing is to be gained by
                            giving the Russians a misleading impression of our point of view about
                            the kind of relationship we hope ultimately to have with them. On the
                            contrary, so long as the Soviets are in a mood for rational
                            conversation, it is important that we avoid actions in trade control
                            policy or elsewhere which seem to the Soviets to belie our expressed
                            readiness to maintain normal contacts of all kinds with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as long as these are possible.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Thompson during his recent visit expressed the opinion that
                            Soviet policy may now be at a crossroads, that it can move either toward
                            detente or toward increased pressure against the West, and that our
                            export control policy may well have a bearing upon the Soviet choice.
                            The Ambassador recognized that we cannot attempt to affect Soviet
                            decisions at the expense of our vital interests. We may not be able to
                            affect the outcome at all. But he feels, and I agree, that we should not
                            risk tipping the balance by actions in matters that are not otherwise of
                            genuine strategic significance.</p>
                        <p>Our friends and allies are entirely opposed to an increase in the
                            severity of existing trade controls at this time. As a practical matter,
                            domestic political forces in Western Europe and Japan leave the
                            governments there with little ability to strengthen the control
                            mechanism. The United States should therefore have no illusions that
                            restrictions by us would be effective in preventing such trade between
                            the Soviet bloc and the rest of the free world.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the recent Congressional discussion in the course of
                            extending the Export Control Act was on the whole more helpful than
                            otherwise. The amendments that were adopted do not require that we give
                            up any of the flexibility we have had in operating our export control
                            policy (Enclosure 3 analyzes the several amendments in the light of the
                            Congressional discussion).<note n="1" xml:id="d309fn1">Not printed, but

                            Congressman Kitchin's amendment, which would have created a presumption
                            of denial of export license applications, <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680"
                                facs="0706"/>was revised and in practical effect reversed in
                            conference. This was at the specific request of the Executive Branch
                            which objected strongly to the change of policy that the amendment would
                            have required.</p>
                        <p>In order to clarify our export control procedures for the future, and in
                            line with the request of the National Security Council Standing Group
                            Meeting of January 26, 1962, I have had reviewed our economic defense
                            policy as set forth in NSC 5704/3. I believe that this policy continues
                            to be consistent with and applicable to our objectives. I have taken the
                            opportunity of this review, however, to propose simpler language and so
                            far as possible to bring policy up to date with the current situation.
                            The resulting redraft is shown as Enclosure 1. I have also attached as
                            Enclosure 2 the Statement of “Criteria and Licensing Policy” which has
                            been the agreed basis for day to day decisions at the staff level in the
                            Departments of State, Commerce and Defense.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that the statement of economic defense policy, and the
                            licensing criteria and policy that apply to it, be affirmed. At the same
                            time, I recommend that the license applications which, under existing
                            criteria and policy, have been recommended for approval at the staff

                            <p>U.S. Economic Defense Policy must be viewed as an instrument of our
                                overall policy toward the bloc and of our total national strategy.
                                Furthermore, it should incorporate the major governing elements of
                                security trade control policy as it has been defined by the present
                                Administration. These governing elements are as follows: <list>

                                        countries continues to be threatened by the Sino-Soviet
                                        bloc. We thus should apply against the bloc such economic
                                        defense measures as will retard the growth of the bloc's

                                        is important to retain controls in such form that they can
                                        be available for use as an instrument of policy during a
                                        crisis situation, and provide a means of putting pressure on
                                        Soviet bloc leaders when their demands become intolerable
                                        and of forcing them, short of a resort to arms, to realize
                                        our determination and the need to reconsider their own

                                    <item>While it is necessary to maintain a system of economic
                                        defense measures, it is equally necessary to maintain or
                                        expand such contacts with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                            >USSR</gloss> and countries of the bloc as will
                                        influence them over the long-run to become more responsible
                                        and peaceful members of the community of nations. Trade
                                        relations are an important channel of communication with
                                        bloc countries. The courses we take should be based on the
                                        assumption that the maintenance of commercial contacts and
                                        trade between the Free World and the European Soviet bloc
                                        may have positive advantages during this period of tension
                                        and watchfulness, and that such trade should be encouraged
                                        except where it would directly increase the military
                                        strength of the bloc. The decision either to restrict or to
                                        promote such trade should be coordinated with decisions in
                                        other fields of our foreign relations so that foreign trade
                                        policy may serve our overall foreign policy goal.</item>

                                    <item>There are forces making for fragmentation within the bloc.
                                        When an opportunity presents itself, as in the case of
                                        Poland, trade and economic relations can become an active
                                        instrument for the promotion of United States policy
                                        interests in relation to bloc cohesion. Economic defense
                                        measures should therefore be applied on a selective basis to
                                        support United States policy with respect to encouraging and
                                        assisting the bloc countries of Eastern Europe to achieve
                                        increased self-determination and more active pursuit of
                                        their own national interests.</item>

                                    <item>To be of greatest effectiveness, the economic defense
                                        system should represent the cooperative efforts of the
                                        principal trading nations and should be coordinated with the
                                        larger system of military and political alliances. In order
                                        to be realistic and effective, the economic defense measures
                                        which the United States should adopt should be coordinated
                                        to the extent possible with those of Free World countries.
                                        In the trade control field our allies are interested,
                                        generally speaking, in limiting controls to commodities of
                                        reasonably clear and direct military significance and
                                        entertain a strong reluctance to enlarge the area of
                                        restrictions. This fact rules out economic warfare except at
                                        a time of high crisis.</item>

                                    <item>The system of trade control should be selective and should
                                        concentrate on the denial of commodities or technology which

                                1949, as amended by P.L. 87-515, approved on July 1, 1962; 76 Stat.
                                127; 50 USC App. 2021-2032. Airgram CA-298 to Belgrade, July 9,
                                summarized the amendments as follows: 1) amendment to Section 1 of
                                the Act broadened the scope of controls to exports of economic
                                significance as well as those of military significance; 2) amendment
                                to Section 2 called for U.S. cooperation with its allies to the
                                maximum extent possible, and the formulation of a unified trading
                                policy by the non-Communist world; 3) amendment to Section 2 called
                                for conduct of U.S. trade with Communist-dominated countries so as
                                to further U.S. national security and policy objectives; 4)
                                amendment to Section 3, a compromise amendment, required a finding
                                to deny a license, while the original proposal required a finding to
                                grand one; and 5) amendment to Section 5 made willful violation of
                                the Act a felony rather than a misdemeanor, and increased penalties
                                accordingly. In this form the Act was extended for 3 years.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, 400.119/7-962)</note> calls for
                            a reassessment of the use of export controls to achieve U.S. national
                                <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0711"/>security and foreign policy
                            objectives. Two major changes were written into the Act: <quote

                                <p>That the United States should make every effort to obtain maximum
                                    agreement among its military Allies on expanded export
                                    controls;</p>
                                <p>That the control system should take into account the “economic
                                    significance” of exports to the Bloc.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The first provision could imply the use of the entire gamut of political,
                            military and economic persuasions to achieve maximum controls. The
                            second could lead to a virtual embargo of exports in that almost any
                            additional goods provided to the Soviet Bloc will per se add to its
                            economic potential.</p>
                        <p>The central questions are whether and how the export control system can
                            contribute to U.S. national security; the answers depend on the nature
                            of the threat:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item><p>If the Soviet Bloc poses a military threat to the Free World,
                                    as U.S. policy currently assumes especially in periphery
                                    countries around the Bloc, certainly the maximum agreement with
                                    our military Allies on trade controls is desirable. If the Bloc
                                    poses a threat to the Free World through either economic
                                    penetration in the less-developed countries or a more rapid
                                    economic growth within the Bloc which permits a commitment of
                                    increased resources to aggressive acts of military, political,
                                    economic, cultural, or propagandistic nature, then a control
                                    system restricting trade which will add to this potential is
                                    certainly desirable. Therefore, the use of our economic and
                                    political power to obtain maximum agreement on expanded controls
                                    by the Allies would be in order, as the new Act urges.</p>
                                <p>Obviously, maximum agreement would not mean total embargo, for
                                    many items contribute so little to economic potentials that
                                    controls would be too costly and unwieldy to impose. Rather, the
                                    objective should be the maximum delay of growth of the Soviet
                                    Bloc at the least cost to other objectives. This greater control
                                    should be imposed over advanced technical data, prototypes, on
                                    entire plants which break significant economic bottlenecks, and
                                    on capital equipment which substantially reduces the drain on
                                    research and development by the Bloc. Little control would be
                                    imposed on consumer goods, which would directly raise the
                                    standard of living of the Bloc and would continually demonstrate
                                        <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0712"/>to their people
                                    that such amenities come from the Free World. What capital
                                    equipment or technical services are exported should be done so
                                    as to increase the people's understanding of the source of these

                            <item>If, on the other hand, controls by the United States which are not
                                concurred in by its Allies and which are over and above the current
                                military-oriented controls have no appreciable adverse impact on the
                                    <hi rend="italic">economic</hi> potential of the Bloc, balance
                                of payments and other considerations would suggest that we abandon
                                all controls other than those imposed under multilateral
                                arrangements (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>). It would
                                then be desirable to seek the maximum outlets for the sales of
                                non-military goods in the Bloc in competition with other Free World
                                suppliers. The means of increasing such sales would include an
                                exchange of Trade Missions, the establishment of a Trade Center in
                                Moscow, the signing of a bilateral trade agreement, and other trade
                                promotion devices. If this approach were to be taken, it would
                                obviously be to our advantage to negotiate our new posture with the
                                Bloc so as to obtain concessions for the relaxation of our controls
                                and the introduction of trade promotion arrangements.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Adoption of the first approach—that of persuading our Allies to invoke
                            tighter controls—would pose no serious problems with Congress, but it
                            raises most difficult problems of negotiation with our Allies. Our
                            intelligence suggests that our Allies would take hardly any step in the
                            direction of economic defense measures, and our current negotiations at
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> demonstrate that they desire
                            to relax current controls. However, the American business community is
                            not convinced that the European business community is eager for an
                            uncontrolled expansion of trade with the Bloc. The assertion by the
                            European businessman that he sells to the Bloc because of government
                            policy and that by European government officials that they cannot
                            control trade because of pressure from the business interests simply do
                            not jibe. We need considerably better intelligence than we have to
                            determine the type and weight of tactics needed to persuade our Allies
                            to become more restrictive. Once this intelligence is gathered, we could
                            determine more accurately the cost in other economic and political
                            relationships with our Allies of pressing for tighter controls. Also,
                            only after a strong attempt in this direction, could we convincingly
                            demonstrate to Congress that the failure to expand controls did not rest
                            on the shoulders of the Administration.</p>
                        <p>If the second approach—that of relaxing controls—is adopted, our Allies
                            will find us more compatible bedfellows but also more competitive. The
                            Congress on the other hand, and probably the public, would be
                            ill-satisfied with an unexplained adoption of a policy which apparently
                            does not coincide with the intention expressed in the Export Control
                            Act. Therefore, the best possible explanation will be needed of the
                            proposition <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0713"/>that controls over
                            non-military items contribute little or nothing to national security or
                            foreign policy objectives of the United States and/or the collateral
                            proposition that economic cooperation with the Bloc (and economic
                            competition in third areas) will gradually mellow the Bloc and draw her
                            into closer association with the Free World.</p>
                        <p>The present policy of control over items contributing to the
                            military-industrial mobilization base of the Bloc plus unilateral
                            controls by the United States accords with neither of the above
                            approaches and leaves both the Congress (and some of the public) and our
                            foreign Allies (and some U.S. businessmen) dissatisfied. It also
                            possibly gains nothing in our relations with the Bloc. It therefore
                            seems to me that we have chosen the least potentially successful
                            policy—that of seeking neither maximum adverse impact on the Soviet
                            economy nor the maximum economic trading contacts with the Bloc for
                            commercial and political advantage.</p>
                        <p>Once the decision is made on these basic approaches, a series of pending
                            cases (including $4.5 million of technical data and equipment in
                            production of tires and petrochemicals and other items and $43 million
                            in automotive machine tolls) and procedural questions will be
                            resolved.</p>

                            <item>Addendum to Memorandum of July 10 on Export Control Policy</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>In discussions with the Departments of Commerce and Defense occasioned by
                            my memorandum of July 10, 1962 for the National Security <pb n="688"
                                xml:id="pg_688" facs="0714"/>Council, it was agreed that the
                            restatement of United States Economic Defense Policy should more
                            explicitly reflect the recent changes in the language of the Export
                            Control Act. I would therefore recommend that the paragraph in enclosure
                            1, which has the agreement of the Departments of Commerce and Defense,
                            be substituted for Paragraph 8 under Courses of Action in the Statement
                            of United States Economic Defense Policy (enclosure 1 to my memorandum
                            of July 10). The Department of Commerce considered that it was necessary
                            to retain the clause in the present <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5704/3 providing for unilateral U.S. control to “serve other U.S. policy
                            objectives.” It is understood that this clause is intended to cover
                            those few special cases (such as scrap iron) on which we have a “moral”
                            position of not participating in exports to the Soviet bloc,
                            irrespective of what other countries do, although the item is not
                            otherwise covered by the language of the enclosed paragraph.</p>
                        <p>It also seems desirable to carry through with the “economic potential”
                            concept set forth in the revised paragraph in enclosure 1 by adding a
                            fourth criterion to the “Criteria and Licensing Policy” (enclosure 2 to
                            my memorandum of July 10). Such a new criterion is included as enclosure
                            2. The criterion covers actions such as that undertaken to deny pipe and
                            pipeline equipment in an attempt to limit the Soviet potential for
                            disrupting the pattern of free world oil supply. Thus this new criterion
                            is intended to carry out the intent of Congress to assure that U.S.
                            exports do not contribute to Soviet economic potentialities which could
                            be damaging to the national security and welfare. This new criterion has
                            likewise been agreed by Commerce and Defense.</p>
                        <p>Finally, while no change seems necessary in criterion (b) of the
                            “Criteria and Licensing Policy” relating to technical data, there is
                            agreement that special effort should be used to assure that controls
                            over technical data adequately protect the national security and
                            welfare.</p>

                                objectives judged by the U.S. control authorities to warrant the use
                                of unilateral controls; provide for denial of all such items the
                                export of which would prove to be detrimental to the national

                                measures as will effectively enforce these controls and prevent

                            Departments of State and Commerce have had recurring differences <pb
                                n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0716"/>over licensing of exports to
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and other Eastern European
                            countries. Pending resolution of this difference in policy view, I have
                            withheld final action on some 59 export license applications. These
                            applications have a total value in excess of $4.8 million. Of this
                            total, approximately $4.4 million involve commodities and $.4 million
                            technical data. (Attachment 1 gives further summary detail on the
                            commodities and technical data in question.)<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2"
                                >Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>I agree completely with the Secretary of State that these pending
                            applications, and indeed our total trade with the Soviet bloc, are
                            “quantitatively” unimportant. Precisely because the amount involved
                            cannot be regarded as significant to the U.S. economy the Administration
                            has, in a sense, an extra burden to show that the United States is not
                            making a “qualitative” contribution to the buildup of the Soviet bloc
                            economy—at the ultimate expense of this country and our allies. In fact,
                            one of the real difficulties confronting us in administering the Export
                            Control Act is the consistent pattern which Soviet bloc countries follow
                            in their trading efforts with the United States. There is little or no
                            indication that I am aware of that the Soviet bloc is genuinely
                            interested in trying to establish a continuing and significant trade
                            with the United States in consumer-type goods produced in the United
                            States in exchange for goods produced in those countries. Rather, the
                            whole pattern is the opposite. The evidence available to me is
                            overwhelming that the Soviet bloc is interested primarily in obtaining
                            machinery, technical data and technically advanced commodities for the
                            purpose of enabling the Soviet bloc to develop its own capacity to
                            produce what it wants rather than expand the scope of a continuing,
                            peaceful trade with the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am completely in accord with the often expressed premise that trade is
                            one of the few means for influencing the Soviet Union toward a more
                            responsible and peaceful attitude in the international community. I
                            believe the United States should, therefore, endeavor to expand trade
                            with the Soviet Union and other bloc countries. However, where items
                            under control are involved which are, at best, in the gray area, I
                            believe their export to the Soviet bloc should be authorized on the
                            basis of a reasonable possibility the Soviet Union will indeed be
                            influenced to a more responsible and peaceful attitude—not on the basis
                            of a mere expression of hope on our part.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most serious problem in our control of exports to the Soviet
                            bloc is the disparity of controls between the United States and our
                            allies. On practically every one of the applications on which there is
                            strong interagency disagreement the primary reason usually cited for
                            authorizing the export is the fact similar items are available to the
                            bloc from other Western nations. Thus, more often than not, the apparent
                                <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0717"/>availability of a similar
                            item from a European source becomes the main reason for authorizing the
                            export from the United States. If there is no possibility of persuading
                            our allies to increase their trade controls, as has been indicated by
                            the Secretary of State, then we are left with the problem of
                            administering whatever level of unilateral controls is deemed
                            appropriate, notwithstanding the position of our allies. In my opinion,
                            we should not set our export controls at the lowest level represented by
                            our allies, and we should not reach the same result indirectly by a
                            process of attrition, that is by approving export applications simply
                            because our allies have not joined us in effective multilateral control
                            of those items in question. At least we should not deliberately follow
                            such a course without establishing a clear record that we have done
                            everything reasonably possible since January 1961 to persuade our allies
                            to much closer agreement with us on the extent of export controls.</p>
                        <p>I therefore suggest that the level of controls on which we should seek to
                            achieve agreement is that described in Attachment 2.<note n="3"

                        <p>The above comments relate to what I would term the “substance” of the
                            issue, apart from the factor of Congressional or public opinion. The
                            latter, of course, deserves careful consideration in view of the recent
                            amendments to the Export Control Act and the investigations of export
                            control during the preceding months by both House and Senate
                            Committees.</p>
                        <p>Relevant to the issue of multilateral controls, Section 1 of the Export
                            Control Act now has the following language: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"The Congress further declares that it is the policy of the
                                    United States to formulate, reformulate, and apply such controls
                                    to the maximum extent possible in cooperation with all nations
                                    with which the United States has defense treaty commitments, and
                                    to formulate a unified commercial and trading policy to be
                                    observed by the non-Communist-dominated nations or areas in
                                    their dealings with the Communist-dominated nations.</p>
                                <p>The Congress further declares that it is the policy of the United
                                    States to use its economic resources and advantages in trade
                                    with Communist-dominated nations to further the national
                                    security and foreign policy objectives of the United
                                    States.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Both the House and Senate Committees investigating export control
                            administration expressed strong concern over the lack of effective
                            multilateral control of exports to the Soviet bloc. The floor debate
                            preceding enactment of this amendment gave further emphasis to this same
                            concern. I think the Administration should, as a part of a desirable and
                            necessary defense of whatever is done in administering the Export
                            Control Act, establish a record of doing something additional during the
                            coming <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0718"/>months to get agreement
                            with our allies on more effective multilateral controls.</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of relevance to deciding individual export license
                            applications, the recent amendment to Section 3 of the Act is the most
                            important. The new language added is as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"Such rules and regulations shall provide for denial of any
                                    request or application for authority to export articles,
                                    materials, or supplies, including technical data, from the
                                    United States, its territories and possessions, to any nation or
                                    combination of nations threatening the national security of the
                                    United States if the President shall determine that such export
                                    makes a significant contribution to the military or economic
                                    potential of such nation or nations which would prove
                                    detrimental to the national security and welfare of the United
                                    States.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As a statement of Congressional intent and policy, the important factor
                            written into the Act by the above quoted language is the economic
                            criterion. Here again, both House and Senate investigating committees
                            expressed strong concern that the Administration should give proper
                            regard to the economic factor in administering export controls. (No one
                            had any particular question about export control of military items.)</p>
                        <p>Under the above quoted language, the President has, in a legal sense,
                            very broad administrative discretion in determining what shall be
                            authorized for export and what shall be denied. It is a matter of
                            executive discretion as to what nation or nations are threatening the
                            national security. It is a matter of administrative discretion to
                            determine whether an export makes a contribution to the military or
                            economic potential of another nation and whether that contribution is
                            “significant.” And, finally, it is a matter of administrative discretion
                            as to whether in any event the export, if authorized, would prove
                            detrimental to the national security and welfare of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the broad legal authority of executive officials under
                            the above quoted language, the Export Control Act should be administered
                            in such a way as to obtain the support of a majority of the Congress. If
                            this is not done, the reaction is likely to be quick and decisive in
                            further restricting executive discretion by changing the Export Control
                            law or in prejudicing other legislative programs of the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>(In writing to the House Committee my comments on the proposed amendment
                            to Section 3, I stated in effect that the Administration was following
                            the standard implicit in the amendment, that is, we were not authorizing
                            for export any items which make a significant contribution to the
                            military or economic potential which would prove detrimental to the
                            national security of the United States.<note n="4" xml:id="d312fn4"

                                been found.</note> In making this statement, I had <pb n="693"
                                xml:id="pg_693" facs="0719"/>in mind those applications which have
                            not been approved as well as those which have been approved.)</p>
                        <p>I cannot agree with the distinguished Secretary of State that the recent
                            Congressional discussion on the Export Control Act was helpful to the
                            Administration. Nor do I agree with the interpretation implicit in the
                            Secretary's memorandum that the recent changes in the Act reflect a
                            Congressional intent that export controls should be administered in a
                            less restrictive manner than has been the case for the last few months.
                            I gather the very opposite impression from a reading of the floor debate
                            on these amendments and from the action in Congress during the past
                            several months. (Attachment 3 consists of pages from the Congressional
                            Record giving the floor debate on extension of the Export Control Act,
                            including the proceedings in the Senate when the first Conference
                            Committee Report was rejected, and the discussion in both the Senate and
                            House when the final Conference Report was approved.)<note n="5"

                                1949 for 1 year without amendment, was rejected by the Senate on

                        <p>To carry out the requirement now contained in Section 3 of the Export
                            Control Act, the Departments of State, Commerce and Defense have agreed

                        <p>In our appearances before the Senate and House Committees investigating
                            the administration of the Export Control Act, as well as our appearance
                            before the Senate and House Banking and Currency Committees in
                            connection with the extension of the Act we did not convince the
                            Committee members that we should have less export control. I believe it
                            would be unfortunate, and unwise, to adopt a policy of export control
                            which will almost assuredly subject the Administration in the coming
                            months to time-consuming and harassing investigations which the Senate
                            Committee has not yet concluded and for which purpose the House Select
                            Committee is seeking additional funds. In addition, I think there would
                            be a definite possibility that further direct legislative action
                            regarding export controls would be taken at this session of Congress if
                            there is any discernible lessening at this time of restrictions on
                            exports to the Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>I would like further to suggest a course of action which, if successful,
                            would achieve a positive gain for the United States and which, if not
                            productive of concrete results, would nevertheless put the
                            Administration <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0720"/>in a position of
                            having a record of doing all that could reasonably be expected in

                            <p>Maintain toward the non-Communist countries export controls over
                                materials, equipment, supplies and technical data (including plants,
                                processes, designs, components, parts, production equipment and
                                production materials) in specific areas, as is required to prevent
                                such items from making a significant contribution to the military or
                                economic potential of the Communist countries such as their ability

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> introduced a
                            discussion of U.S. export control policy by commenting on the thankless
                            task which the Secretary of Commerce had been given by Congress in
                            making him responsible for the administration of the Export Control
                            Act.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, in reviewing the
                            existing situation, pointed out that U.S. trade with the Soviet Bloc was
                            very small, but that the Congress continued to have an unusual interest
                            in this subject. He cited changes in the law adopted by the Congress
                            this session which had an effect on the implementation of the Export
                            Control Act. He emphasized that Congressman Kitchin had been successful
                            in adding to the definition of trade to be controlled and the concept of
                            trade contributing to the economic potential of the Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that everyone
                            in the Administration agreed on the general policy to be followed in
                            licensing exports to the Bloc, but trouble always arose when judgments
                            had to be made on individual cases.</p>
                        <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0722"/>
                        <p>Trade with the Soviet Bloc is not only a problem for us domestically, but
                            has important multilateral aspects. For example, the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> wants to expand its trade with the Soviet
                            Bloc and reduce the number of items which cannot be traded freely to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Our allies, he continued, are
                            heavier traders with the Bloc, and, therefore, they will not support us
                            to the extent we wish on limiting or controlling this trade. In addition
                            to the economic reasons, our allies differ with us in principle in that
                            they have basic doubts as to the value of conducting what they describe
                            as economic warfare against the Bloc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> proposed that no
                            effort be made now to decide our long-run policy, but that we should
                            decide to deal favorably toward the 59 pending export license
                            applications referred to in the letter of July 16, 1962 from the
                            Secretary of Commerce.<note n="1" xml:id="d313fn1"><ref target="#d312"
                                    >Document 312</ref>.</note> He again referred to the present
                            situation in which we are confronting the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> on Berlin. He said the Soviet Union is now faced with
                            a choice of moving toward peace or toward war in the immediate future.
                            His recommendation was that we not yield at all on Berlin, but we should
                            convey to the Soviet Union our flexibility in other fields, for example,
                            in an easier export license policy. In the event that the Berlin crisis
                            is resolved, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said
                            we should immediately examine the entire question of trade with the
                            Soviet Bloc.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that our export control policy is more strict
                            than the limitations placed on our allies by the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list. He also noted that the
                            Soviets do not want to buy from us goods which are peaceful, and,
                            therefore, not controlled, but they continue to insist on trying to buy
                            goods which they want for their own purposes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName>, in response to a
                            question from the President, recalled that when Khrushchev was in the
                            U.S. no increase in trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            resulted from the conversations at that time because the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> wanted to make all its purchases on
                                credit.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">Reference is to the visit to the
                                United States by Soviet Chairman Nikita S. Khru-shchev September

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said we could easily
                            expand our trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if we
                            granted credit as is being done by our allies in Europe. He said that
                            the Soviets would be prepared to settle their lend-lease accounts if we
                            gave them credits. He recounted the staged irritation of Khrushchev
                            involving our disinclination to sell the Russians a complete shoe
                            manufacturing plant.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1"
                                >Kohler</persName> said that the Russians would probably be willing
                            to pay us $300 million in settlement of the lend-lease accounts if we
                            provided substantial credits to them. It was pointed out that credits to
                            the Soviet Union are controlled by the Johnson <pb n="697"

                            would have to be changed if we decided to extend credit to the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>, in defending his
                            position of denying the majority of the pending export license
                            applications, said that the U.S. was now selling very little to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He said the Russians were
                            picking and choosing things they want, with the result that we were
                            helping to build up their economy. He urged that we try once more to
                            persuade our allies to join us in strict control of trade with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. If this attempt failed, he
                            urged that we negotiate bilaterally with the Russians in an effort to
                            increase vastly our trade with them. He viewed present policy as getting
                            us nothing and at the same time exposing us to serious Congressional
                            criticism.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> said that the new
                            policy agreed to by State and Commerce, in effect, meant that we were
                            throwing away the existing Economic Defense Policy even before we sought
                            to persuade our allies to go along with implementing strict trade
                            control measures. In his view the new proposal goes directly against
                            Congressional wishes expressed this session. The new paper omits several
                            parts of the old paper which he felt should be kept. He recommended that
                            the existing paper be reaffirmed after modifying it in order to meet the
                            legislative changes approved by Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the State
                            Department could live with the existing paper. He urged, however, that
                            we not attempt to persuade our allies to follow us in a policy of strict
                            control of exports to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He
                            doubted that our allies would be persuaded and the only result would be
                            that our failure would hurt us with Congress and hurt us in other
                            countries. In fact, it might produce in Congress a strong reaction
                            against our allies. He concluded by saying that in his opinion recent
                            legislative changes require no change in our existing export control
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that general
                            language was very difficult to draft. He added that he had agreed upon
                            the earlier rules governing implementation of our policy, but that at
                            the time of the Berlin crisis we had made the rules much more
                            restrictive. He believed that we should now return the licensing rules
                            to the level existing prior to the Berlin crisis. He agreed that if the
                            Defense Department said in a specific case that the goods involved were
                            of strategic importance to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            then such a license should be denied. However, if the goods did not
                            seriously affect the military potential of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, he believed the license should be granted.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the
                            Defense Department agreed with everyone that goods involving the

                            not be exported, but called attention to the differing views on whether
                            it <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0724"/>was in the U.S. interest to
                            assist in building up the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> economy.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> called attention to
                            the mutual benefit of trade with the Bloc. Although our trade is very
                            little, Europe's trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            of real benefit to the West in that it increases the economic health of
                            the European countries.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether we want anything from Russian trade other
                            than gold, and the answer was no. He then suggested we approach our
                            allies in order to meet Congressional pressure. Following this approach,
                            we would talk to the Russians about trade in general, and if they were
                            uninterested, we would continue the present unsatisfactory
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that if we deny the
                            pending licenses, the Russians will conclude that we do not want to
                            trade with them. The subject of trade has always been of great
                            importance to them, even though the amount of trade is very little. He
                            said that our trade this year with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is about half of what it was last year. He then
                            proposed that we talk to our allies about a “fair trade practice”
                            agreement which we would then present to the Russians. His suggestion
                            was that we meet the requirement to talk to our allies by attempting to
                            take the problem of trade out of the cold war area. To do this, he would
                            seek to draft a trade pact with rules. The purpose would be to induce
                            the Russians to trade in a fair way in the West rather than using trade
                            as an instrument of their foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized the discussion by directing that the existing
                            Economic Defense Policy paper be revised to the extent necessary to
                            reflect recent changes in the law made by Congress. Trade for the next
                            two months with the Soviet Union would continue about as it was prior to
                            the Berlin conference. As soon as we knew what was going to happen in
                            Berlin, we would then review our policy. At some point we would tell the
                            Russians frankly that if they keep asking for the same type of goods as
                            they have in the past, it would be very difficult for us to increase
                            substantially peaceful trade with them.</p>
                        <p>Following the meeting and after the President left, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> discussed for fifteen minutes
                            the pending export license applications. Their agreement is reflected in
                            the Record of Action of the meeting, i.e., most pending licenses will be
                            approved and the export to the Soviet Bloc of automotive manufacturing
                            machinery will be denied.</p>

                            REVIEW</p>
                        <p>The Coordinating Committee on Export Controls (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss>) has completed its annual review of 1962 of the
                            international lists. Changes will be effective October 1. The lists
                            define strategic items over which the Free World exercises control of
                            exports to the Soviet bloc. The major part of the review was devoted to
                            the electronics category of the embargo list. This reflects the
                            strategic importance of advancing electronics technology in today's age
                            of rocketry and space exploration.</p>
                        <p>The results of the review, which was conducted in Paris April 1-July 13,
                            1962, are highly satisfactory from our standpoint. There were no
                            significant differences of opinion with the British similar to those
                            which characterized the review last year. This was due in large part to
                            successful high-level policy discussions with the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> here in February and subsequent bilateral working level
                            meetings in London. (See page 1, February 27, 1962 issue.)<note n="1"

                        <p>The participating countries in the 1962 list review took some 90 actions
                            affecting 74 items as defined in International List I (embargo), List IV
                            (watch list) and the Munitions List. New important items added to the
                            embargo list include: electric arc devices, electron beam welders, some
                            15 fluorocarbon compounds, gravity meters, and special batteries or
                            power sources. Most of these new items embody advanced technology and in
                            the US are related to production for or use in military and space
                            exploration programs. The only new item of consequence we had proposed
                            for embargo and which did not get acceptance was multifuel engines.</p>
                        <p>Jig borers, forging hammers, and picric acid were deleted from the
                            embargo list as were certain type of transistors and magnetic metals, in
                            view of the unanimous judgment of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> that they no longer meet the strategic criteria for
                            embargo.</p>
                        <p>Many more items were redefined. Embargo coverage was narrowed for 22 IL-I
                            items, expanded for 17 items, and clarified for 6 items. Twelve <pb

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Luther</hi>: Thank you for your letter of July
                            20 giving some further thoughts on the matters discussed at the National
                            Security Council meeting on July 17.<note n="1" xml:id="d316fn1">In his
                                July 20 letter to <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> called for a U.S.
                                approach through the Consultative Group in Paris “to get our Allies
                                to agree to improve the level of multilateral export controls toward
                                the Sino-Soviet bloc, as proposed at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> meeting on Tuesday, July 17.” He suggested
                                discussions in the Consultative Group for joint action on expanding
                                trade in consumer goods with the Soviet bloc or arranging U.S.
                                bilateral trade agreements with Soviet bloc countries for trade not
                                under multilateral controls. He also suggested a commercial code of
                                trade behavior. (Ibid., 490.119/7-2062)</note></p>
                        <p>Since receiving your letter, we have also received the National Security
                            Council Record of Action (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Action
                            2455) of the Council meeting of July 17, 1962. The Record of Action
                            conforms with my understanding of the agreement reached on that occasion
                            with regard to the nature of the approach to our Allies, namely, that as
                            a complementary approach to <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0728"
                            />economic defense an effort would be made in an appropriate Allied
                            forum “to draft a Western code of fair trade practices for presentation
                            to the Soviet Bloc”. In this connection, we have already undertaken work
                            within this Department on the question of a code of fair practices, and
                            are reviewing that work at the moment as a basis for further discussion
                            with the other interested agencies.</p>
                        <p>It seems quite clear that the receptivity of our Allies to the proposal
                            for establishment of a code of fair practices in East-West trade will
                            depend on their initial understanding and support of our concern at the
                            need to develop uniform ground rules covering the conduct of Allied
                            trade with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Bloc. It will
                            be necessary to obtain their agreement at a high level on the
                            desirability, as a general matter of foreign policy, of agreeing upon
                            such principles. In this connection, I agree with your suggestion that
                            at an appropriate time preliminary high level approaches be made
                            bilaterally to prepare a favorable reception for our formal multilateral
                            approach. Only following agreement by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries as a group would it be possible fruitfully
                            to consider such specific matters as the development of uniform rules to
                            cope with disruptive pricing practices, the resale of primary
                            commodities, inadequate arbitration, patent and copyright procedures,
                            and the lack of reasonable access by businessmen. I think you will agree
                            that these are all rather complicated and diverse matters which will
                            involve considerable study in order to coordinate an Allied position
                            thereon.</p>
                        <p>As to the appropriate international forum for these projected
                            discussions, it would seem to us that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> Council of Economic Advisers (<gloss
                                target="#t_ECONAD1">ECONAD</gloss>) would be initially the suitable
                            and logical place for such discussions with our principal Allies. As you
                            know, with the exception of the question of strategic trade controls,
                            the <gloss target="#t_ECONAD1">ECONAD</gloss> is the forum in which
                            questions of economic relationships between <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries and the Soviet Bloc have been discussed—for
                            example, Soviet oil, oil pipelines, credits to the Soviet Bloc. If we
                            meet with some success in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we
                            could then consider broadening our approach to other forums.</p>
                        <p>We will be taking up with your Department shortly our detailed proposals
                            for the code of general trading practices.</p>
                        <p>With warm personal regards,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Luther</hi>: This is in response to the
                            suggestion in your letter of August 17 about the possibility of
                            negotiating an expansion of multilateral controls on trade with the
                            Soviet bloc.<note n="1" xml:id="d317fn1">In his August 17 letter to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> proposed negotiations on
                                expansion of trade in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                Council of Economic Advisers and on expansion of the level of export
                                controls in the Consultative Group. (Ibid.)</note></p>
                        <p>I realize that the National Security Council on July 17 discussed the
                            idea of a determined effort to get our Allies to agree to a higher level
                            of multilateral export controls, but I am not aware of any agreement
                            having been reached that a special attempt along those lines should be
                            made, nor does <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> action 2455 record
                            any such agreement.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, we could not at this time obtain agreement in <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> on an expansion of export controls.
                            Prevailing attitudes in Western Europe and Japan on Soviet bloc trade,
                            when coupled with the rule of unanimity in the Coordinating Committee,
                            make it clear that negotiations would be fruitless. At a time when we
                            are engaged in talks with the Soviets on matters of major political
                            importance, I would not wish to undertake trade control negotiations
                            which I believe could not succeed and which would seem likely to have an
                            adverse impact on our bilateral talks with the Soviets and add to the
                            differences among the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance
                            countries. In saying this, I wish to add that should the situation in
                            Berlin or elsewhere take a marked turn for the worse, I would expect
                            that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would promptly take up the
                            imposition of selected economic countermeasures as one of several
                            important indicators to the Soviets of the unity of the Western nations
                            in the face of a crisis. As you know, last year <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> agreed in principle on a total economic embargo on the
                            Soviet bloc in the event of blockage of access to Berlin and on air
                            countermeasures in the event of significant air corridor harassment.</p>

                            will recall in the discussion at the July 17th meeting of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, I coupled the approaches to our Allies
                            on these two issues. I have since that meeting reported to both
                            Congressman Kitchin and Senator Dodds and stated in my press conference
                            today that we would seek multilateral agreement with our Allies on these
                            aspects of trade with the bloc. These statements were in accord with my
                            understanding of the discussion at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss>, in which the President told the two of us to see what
                            could be done towards multilateral agreement on both expanded controls
                            and peaceful trade, even though it appeared that we might not
                            succeed.</p>
                        <p>I, of course, accept your judgment as to whether now is the appropriate
                            time to seek an expanded level of controls with our Allies, <pb n="705"
                                xml:id="pg_705" facs="0731"/>particularly to offset the economic
                            warfare thrust of the bloc. But I had a clear understanding from the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> discussion that we would seek an
                            appropriate time for such discussions.</p>
                        <p>It was my further clear understanding that after the multilateral
                            discussions, setting the limits of beneficial trade, we would seek to
                            develop an agreed code of fair practices for trade with State-trading
                            countries. I am glad to have the suggested code which you sent and am
                            having it examined by my staff. I am asking Dr. <persName

                        <p>The Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 had an impact on U.S. export
                            control policy. On October 23, President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> proclaimed U.S. interdiction of offensive
                            weapons to Cuba, effective October 24. The Department of Commerce
                            continued to allow shipments only of nonsubsidized foodstuffs,
                            medicines, and medical supplies on humanitarian grounds as well as gift
                            parcels of limited value to Cuba, but held up, for the time being,
                            approval of all licenses for shipment to Soviet bloc countries and
                            Yugoslavia, except general licenses for moving goods of no strategic
                            value and gifts. It did nothing about licenses already issued, all of
                            which were valid for 6 months. (Memorandum from <persName

                            October 1960 discouraged all shipments to Cuba other than specified food

                        <p>In summary, these letters set forth a Department position along the
                            following lines. The annual review of the international strategic lists
                            in the Coordinating Committee (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>)
                            is the principal means of carrying out the intent of Congress that the
                            United States should “formulate, reformulate, and apply such
                            [export]controls to the maximum extent possible in cooperation with all
                            nations with which the United States has defense treaty commitments.”
                            Any consideration of an expanded multilateral export control program of
                            the comprehensive nature described by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1"
                                >Fowler</persName> must take account of the basic non-negotiability
                            of such proposals in the absence of a very much worsened international
                            climate. The lines of development in East-West relations growing from
                            the Cuban confrontation seem today even less likely to support a broad
                            new economic warfare approach than was the case in early September when
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> dealt with this
                            question in his letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName>. With respect to the more explicit requirement in
                            the amendment to Section 2 of the Export Control Act that the United
                            States should “formulate a unified commercial and trading policy to be
                            observed by the non-Communist nations”, the Department has proposed and
                            transmitted initially to Commerce for comment under cover of the
                            Secretary's letter to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName> of September 5 a draft “Code of Fair Practices in
                            International Trade”.</p>
                        <p>It should be recognized that progress has been made, to the extent
                            warranted by the circumstances and practicable at the time, on all the
                            four points enumerated by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1"
                                >Fowler</persName> on pages four and five of his memorandum, even
                            though they have not been presented in an over-all package program. We
                            do have a coordinated program with our Allies for the utilization of
                            economic sanctions in the event of blockage of access to <pb n="708"
                                xml:id="pg_708" facs="0734"/>Berlin and with respect to Cuba, even
                            though these measures may not be as extensive as we would prefer.
                            (Indeed, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> himself
                            performed a valuable service in handling the four power negotiations in
                            Paris and Washington last year on Berlin countermeasures.) We do have an
                            agreement developed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> which lays
                            the basis for the limitation of sales of large diameter pipe to the
                            Soviet bloc. We have discussed in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            the problem of Soviet oil sales and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> countries have agreed to a policy of caution and
                            restraint with respect to imports of Soviet oil. We also have in <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> a recognized opening to discuss other
                            commodity problems that may involve questions of excessive dependence on
                            bloc materials or supplies. We have over the years made a very great
                            effort to obtain recognition of the United States position on the
                            extension of credits to the Soviet bloc, and have an agreed system of
                            reporting, periodic review and discussion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. It is surely fair to say that the entire array of our
                            efforts to enlist cooperation from our Allies in aid programs for less
                            developed countries represents the kind of effort at “preventing,
                            countering, checking or minimizing Sino-Soviet bloc economic penetration
                            and subversion of uncommitted or less developed countries” which Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> mentions in his third
                            point. There is also an established program in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> for periodic review and discussion of the Soviet
                            economic offensive, an arrangement which makes possible the discussion
                            of potential danger spots. Finally, there is agreement to discuss in
                                <gloss target="#t_ECONAD1">ECONAD</gloss> the kind of program
                            concerning trade with the Soviet bloc visualized in Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName>'s fourth point, and this
                            Department's draft trade code looks in the direction of developing a
                            United States position for such a discussion.</p>
                        <p>The achievement of the kind of comprehensive program outlined by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FHH1">Fowler</persName> would depend upon
                            gaining the full support of our Allies. Since there are very real
                            differences on their part with both the underlying policy justification
                            and details of such a program, we believe our best course is to continue
                            to pursue more limited objectives. We would conclude, therefore, that
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy, amended as we have
                            suggested, will for the present continue to provide an adequate basis
                            for our efforts in the economic defense area.</p>

                        <p>It is necessary to bring up-to-date our policy statement on bilateral
                            civil aviation relations with the Sino-Soviet Bloc in view of
                            developments since the previous policy statement adopted in 1957 by the
                            National Security Council was withdrawn last year.<note n="1"

                            that in the foreseeable future there is unlikely to be an improvement in
                            our relations with the Bloc of sufficient importance to warrant
                            consideration of a bilateral civil aviation agreement, we should be
                            ready for such a contingency. The attached policy statement (Tab A)
                            provides for that contingency and incorporates considerations militating
                            for and against an agreement on our side and on the Bloc side.<note

                        <p>The second draft policy statement (Tab B) has been developed because
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5726/1 has been withdrawn and we
                            need comprehensive policy guidance in the area of Bloc civil air
                            activities abroad. Our experience with the Congo, the Sudan, and Cuba
                            suggests strongly to me that we need a basic policy statement against
                            which to measure and develop programs of action, particularly in Africa
                            and Latin America, related to Bloc civil air activities in the Free
                            World.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that such a policy must rest on the following premises and
                            rationale: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That Bloc inroads in the civil aviation area are undesirable
                                    because they can enhance, sometimes in substantial measure, the
                                    Bloc's capabilities to attain its military and political
                                    objectives in the developing countries, and</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>For both political and economic reasons, our capabilities to
                                    prevent such inroads are limited and therefore must be applied
                                    with circumspection on the basis of a carefully defined system
                                    of priorities.</item>

                        <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0736"/>
                        <p>While the dangers from Bloc moves in this field can be indiscriminately
                            exaggerated, our experience amply demonstrates that they can afford
                            opportunities for Bloc political gains beyond those provided by other
                            forms of Bloc presence. In a crisis situation such as occurred in the
                            Congo and in Cuba, the lack of air traffic rights handicapped the Bloc
                            in supporting footholds it had gained through other means. Equally
                            serious is the possibility that Bloc influence in, and control over, air
                            facilities within a country could enable it to act quickly and
                            decisively at a time of internal political crisis.</p>
                        <p>Beyond these critical potentialities, civil air access to the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s tends to enhance the Bloc's prestige
                            and to facilitate its over-all program to develop close political and
                            economic bonds with specific developing countries. Bloc experience in
                            Guinea and Ghana, however, indicates that civil aviation activities can
                            boomerang. When the Bloc undertakes to support a civil aviation program
                            that is uneconomic to begin with, it runs the risk of being saddled with
                            the costs and the onus of responsibility when the program fails and
                            disillusionment sets in. More generally, in any attempt to establish a
                            broad international civil aviation network in competition with the West,
                            the Bloc operates under the considerable disabilities of its relatively
                            inferior equipment and of prospectively thin traffic routes.</p>
                        <p>In regard to our own limitations, we must recognize first that among the
                            non-aligned developing countries the negotiation of an exchange of air
                            rights with the Bloc frequently is viewed as an assertion of their
                            recently won sovereignty and an evidence of balanced neutrality.
                            Additionally, an offer of Bloc civil aviation assistance can appeal to a
                            strongly felt need irrespective of its justification for improved
                            transport facilities within and through these countries. We could
                            attempt to consider such offers whenever they are made but such an
                            across-the-board effort would be politically burdensome and would create
                            serious distortions in our economic assistance programs.</p>
                        <p>These circumstances point to the need for flexible and carefully
                            modulated measures in this field. Our civil aviation program in
                            developing countries will be most successful in limiting Bloc
                            penetration to the degree that they are consistent with over-all
                            economic assistance criteria. <hi rend="italic">We cannot, however,
                                limit our actions in this field solely to measures justified by
                                these criteria</hi>. Our approach should be based on the following
                            principles:</p>

                                stress-ing the dangers involved and our unfavorable view of such
                                actions. At the same time, we should make sure that the developing
                                countries have a clear understanding of where their self-interest in
                                fact lies and an accurate measure of their bargaining strength in
                                any negotiation with the Bloc.</item>

                            <item>Through our own programs and through actions developed jointly
                                with our allies, we should seek to encourage the development of
                                national air services that meet the transportation development needs
                                of the country concerned and fit into feasible regional services.
                                Such programs would tend to fill vacuums that Bloc civil aviation
                                offers seek to exploit and thus would provide the developing
                                countries with effective self-interest grounds for rejecting civil

                        <p>The Secretary of Commerce has raised two important questions about our
                            present trade with the Soviet Union which I think worth serious

                            <item><p>Do we now deal with the Soviet Union on the export of
                                    technically advanced machinery and equipment in a manner which
                                    adequately protects U.S. interests? Where a national security
                                    issue is presented, we of course deny an export license. There
                                    are, however, many cases in which no clear security issue arises
                                    and yet we know that the Soviets are using American machinery
                                    and equipment as a basis for copying our technology. Are we
                                    being adequately compensated in these sales?</p>
                                <p>Is there any method of organizing these transactions which would
                                    secure a better quid pro quo than the present method of leaving
                                    it to the individual seller to secure the best price he can in
                                    the transaction, in the light of the fact the Soviet Union does

                            <item>Should we reconsider the whole of our trade with the Soviet Union
                                in the light of trade between Western Europe and the Soviet Union
                                and its European satellites? Considering the character and volume of
                                that trade, would a generally less restrictive policy be more in
                                keeping with the interests of the United States? How much
                                possibility is there for a significant broadening of trade that is
                                consistent with our security interests? Would this possibility be
                                such as to justify a general negotiation on trade and commercial
                                matters with the Soviet Union?</item>

                                the Export Control Act of 1949: “The Congress further declares that
                                it is the policy of the United States to formulate, reformulate, and

                            of trade carried on with the Soviet bloc by our Allies as compared with
                            our own trade with the bloc, as well as the differing political
                            evaluations of that trade by individual Western governments, the United
                            States has been remarkably successful in obtaining as substantial a
                            multilateral control policy as now exists. It is, however, a compelling
                            fact that without itself having a significant stake in East-West trade,
                            the United States cannot expect to have a determining voice in the
                            manner in which such trade is carried on by other major Western
                            countries under present world conditions.</p>

                            Western countries a uniform policy on trade with the Soviet bloc
                            countries, I would appreciate it if you would regard the report as not

                                SECTION 3(b) OF THE EXPORT CONTROL ACT OF 1949 AS AMENDED JULY 1,
                                1962</p>
                            <p>The amendment to Section 3(b) of the Export Control Act of 1949
                                provides a clear endorsement of the principle that our efforts in
                                the East-West field should be carried out to the maximum extent
                                possible on a multilateral basis. This amendment has two aspects
                                which are commented on separately.</p>
                            <p>The first is the provision that the United States should formulate,
                                reformulate and apply export controls to the maximum extent possible
                                in cooperation with Allied nations. The major means whereby we
                                pursue this objective is through the Consultative Group and
                                Coordinating Committee (<gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss>-<gloss
                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>) operation and the annual list
                                review procedure. The purpose of the annual <gloss
                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> list review is to keep the
                                International <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0740"/>Lists
                                currently valid by adjusting them to new technological, military and
                                economic developments in the Sino-Soviet bloc and the free world. It
                                provides this Government with an opportunity to propose the addition
                                of important new items to the International Lists, provided that
                                they can be justified under the applicable criteria. In the 1962
                                review the United States was successful in obtaining agreement for
                                the addition to the embargo list of the following new items:
                                electrical arc heaters, electron beam welders, some fifteen
                                fluorocarbon compounds, gravity meters, and special batteries or
                                power sources. Most of these new items embody advanced technology
                                and in the United States are related to production for or use in
                                military and space exploration programs. Only two whole items and
                                two partial items were deleted from the embargo list; the United
                                States itself proposed deletion of these items on the grounds that
                                they were no longer significant. Forty-five items were revised or
                                clarified, seventeen of these revisions resulting in net expansion
                                of embargo coverage.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> annual review is
                                scheduled to begin in October of this year. Careful preparations are
                                being made for this review by canvassing all available American
                                research developments and intelligence in order to identify the
                                technologically advanced items of strategic significance that should
                                be brought under multilateral control. While we cannot be certain
                                what negotiating problems may be faced this year, the Department
                                intends to make every effort to further the interests of this
                                Government consistent with the objectives of United States policy in
                                this field as set forth both in the Export Control Act and the
                                Mutual Defense Assist-ance Control Act of 1951.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the second provision of the amendment requiring the
                                formulation of a “unified commercial and trading policy to be
                                observed by the non-Communist nations”,<note n="5" xml:id="d323fn5"
                                    >This phrase should read “by the non-Communist-dominated
                                    nations.”</note> the situation is not as clear cut as is the
                                case with respect to the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                                negotiations. With respect to <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                    >COCOM</gloss> and Battle Act strategic controls it is fair to
                                say that we do have a unified policy although there may be
                                differences in detail on the merits of embargoing particular
                                commodities. In the area of trade and economic relations with the
                                Soviet bloc beyond the scope of strategic controls, however, the
                                fact is that the United States has a more restrictive policy than do
                                other Western nations. The United States denies the export to the
                                Soviet bloc of a wider range of commodities and technology than do
                                other major trading countries. We maintain a complete embargo on
                                trade with Communist China, North Korea and north Viet-Nam. We do
                                not permit United States flag vessels to engage in voyages to those
                                areas. Our controls on trade and shipping with Cuba are more
                                sweeping than the controls of other friendly countries. American law
                                in effect prevents <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0741"/>the
                                extension of credit to the Soviet bloc and requires the payment of a
                                higher level of import tariffs on goods of Soviet bloc origin. The
                                entry of certain types of furs from the Soviet Union is prohibited
                                by United States law.</p>
                            <p>To achieve uniformity on the basis of the policies and practices of
                                our Allies, assuming we wished as a matter of policy to do so, would
                                require changes in American laws. Alternatively, to attempt to
                                achieve uniformity on the basis of present American policy and
                                practices would require a major policy confrontation with other
                                Western countries. Given the economic and foreign trade problems
                                that some of these countries face, they are aggressively pursuing
                                the expansion of trade with the Soviet bloc, and they consider that
                                this has political as well as purely commercial or balance of
                                payment advantages. While United States policy toward trade is
                                permissive, it also is based on the assumption that the continuation
                                of a pattern of mutually advantageous trade relationships with the
                                Soviet bloc is to the interest of the West.</p>
                            <p>The question is, therefore, whether there is a redefinition of
                                East-West economic relationships which would be advantageous, which
                                would fall somewhere between our policy and that of our Allies, and
                                which might be negotiable with them. In studying the possibilities
                                for such a proposal, we are considering the concept of a code which
                                might set forth standards to be sought by market economy countries
                                in their trading relations with the state trading countries of the
                                Soviet bloc.</p>
                            <p>The objective of achieving agreement on such a standardized pattern
                                of trading relations with the Soviet bloc nations is unquestionably
                                a highly desirable one. Whatever attempts we make to this end,
                                however, must be viewed against the background of the present state
                                of trading relationships between Western countries and Soviet bloc
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>The principal compelling fact is that the other major industrialized
                                countries of the Western world carry on trading relationships with
                                the Soviet bloc at a much higher level than is the case with respect
                                to the United States, and with far less predisposition to restrict
                                exports. The exports of the Western European countries to the Soviet
                                bloc run at a rate of over $2 billion annually while the United
                                States exports are only a twentieth of that. Western European (and
                                Japanese) exports to the Sino-Soviet bloc rose to $2.8 billion in
                                1962 and imports to $2.9 billion. United States exports to the bloc
                                were only $125 million and imports $79 million. The exports of all
                                free world countries to the Soviet bloc exceeded $5 billion.</p>
                            <p>In these circumstances and under present conditions in East-West
                                relations, the United States would be in a very difficult position
                                to persuade other major trading countries that they should make any
                                sweeping changes in their methods of trading with the Soviet bloc.
                                From their standpoint, while there may be some complications in
                                carrying on trade <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0742"/>with
                                state-trading countries, the amount of trade that takes place
                                indicates that the Western countries have been reasonably successful
                                in overcoming those difficulties. Without a significant stake in
                                East-West trade the United States cannot expect to have a
                                determining voice in the manner in which such trade is carried on by
                                other Western trading countries.</p>
                            <p>The trade of other free world countries, moreover, is carried on
                                without the apparatus of restriction and control over both strategic
                                and nonstrategic trade which already characterizes United States
                                trade with the Soviet bloc. As long as the other industrialized
                                countries of the West are satisfied with the conditions under which
                                their trade with the Soviet bloc takes place, there is no compelling
                                reason for them to impose new or different standards or regulations,
                                especially if such action is unlikely to increase the level of
                                trade. At the same time, so long as other countries are unwilling to
                                adopt rules on exports as stringent as those enforced by the United
                                States, American controls will inevitably have a limited effect.
                                Unless the commodities embargoed by the United States are subject to
                                identical international control or are uniquely American in their
                                availability, the Soviet bloc can obtain what it wishes from other
                                supplying countries. In these circumstances and recognizing that in
                                the absence of a marked worsening of international relations a
                                change in the attitude of other countries is unlikely, the problems
                                of achieving a general agreement on a common code of trade practices
                                appear very formidable indeed. Nevertheless, the Department intends
                                to have discussions on this problem with our Allies in the future
                                and has been actively working on the elements of a standardized code
                                which might be negotiable. We cannot, however, be optimistic about
                                the prospects for making a useful settlement in this area.</p>
                            <p>Although we face the general negotiating problem outlined, we have on
                                certain issues sought an accommodation with Allied countries in an
                                area beyond the limitations of the present <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                    >COCOM</gloss> system. This has been the case on such questions
                                as the supply of wide diameter pipe to the Soviet Union, the problem
                                of credit terms to the Soviet bloc, Soviet penetration of less
                                developed countries, and specialized world commodity problems such
                                as petroleum in which Soviet capabilities are a significant factor.
                                We will continue to make further efforts at reaching multilateral
                                agreements over and beyond the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                    >COCOM</gloss> control when the situation warrants such
                                efforts.</p>
                            <p>In summary, it must be recognized that there are manifold issues
                                involved in the carrying on of economic and commercial relations
                                with the Soviet bloc during the present stage of East-West
                                relationships. Concurrently, it must also be recognized that almost
                                without exception the objectives which we seek in terms of a more
                                regularized Western trading policy towards the bloc would require a
                                strengthening of governmental control in one form or another by
                                other cooperating nations. Given the <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717"
                                    facs="0743"/>present attitude of Western European countries
                                towards East-West trade, we could not expect to obtain full Western
                                European acceptance and application of any pattern of economic
                                relationships with the Soviet bloc that might contain elements of
                                economic warfare, even if that aim were considered by this
                                Government to be desirable.</p>
                            <p>United States policies are kept under continuous examination to
                                assure that they contain the proper balance of restraint and
                                permissive contacts which are so highly necessary as a means of
                                working towards a long-term assumption of responsible patterns of
                                conduct by the Soviet Union and other Soviet bloc countries. As is
                                recognized in the amendment to the Export Control Act, our only
                                prospect for effectiveness in seeking coordinated trade policies is
                                to work with our Allies on a mutual basis. While there is some
                                indication of an increased awareness on the part of our Allies and
                                the less committed countries of Soviet objectives and capabilities
                                in the economic field, it must be emphasized that given the present
                                attitude of Western European countries on East-West trade it would
                                at best be very difficult to obtain their cooperation in a uniform
                                trade policy. So long as we are enabled to preserve a flexible and
                                balanced approach to these problems under existing legislation, we
                                should continue to be able to make some progress towards United
                                States objectives.</p>

                                    technically-advanced machinery and equipment in a manner which
                                    adequately protects U.S. interests? Where a national security
                                    issue is presented, we of course deny an export license. There
                                    are, however, many cases in which no clear security issue arises
                                    and yet we know that the Soviets are using American machinery
                                    and equipment as a basis for copying our technology. Are we
                                    being adequately compensated in these sales?</p>

                                Union in the light of trade between Western Europe and the Soviet
                                Union and its European satellites? Considering the character and
                                volume of that trade, would a generally less restrictive policy be
                                more in keeping with the interests of the United States? How much
                                possibility is there for a significant broadening of trade that is
                                consistent with our security interests? Would this possibility be
                                such as to justify a general negotiation on trade and commercial

                        <p>Although phrased in terms of the commercial possibilities and security
                            interests involved in trade with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, these questions are intimately concerned with our
                            over-all political relations with the Bloc. Trade policy toward the
                            European satellites is a necessary element in the examination. For the
                            same reason, our policy on trade with Communist China and Cuba can be
                            excluded, as being greatly subordinated to a separate body of political
                            factors affecting our relations with these areas.</p>
                        <p>The President's questions, therefore, pose all the basic issues involved
                            in our controls on trade with the European Communist Bloc. What are
                            these controls achieving and what are they failing to achieve? What are
                            the major stakes we have in this policy? Is this an “expendable” policy
                            from the standpoint of the U.S. and under what circumstances; is it a
                            “saleable” commodity to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and
                            in what sense?</p>
                        <p>These are broad issues because the political significance attached to our
                            trade restrictions has been disproportionate to the trade itself. For a
                            number of years now, we have attempted to maintain, virtually in
                            isolation, a posture tantamount to economic warfare. A change in this
                            stance would therefore carry considerable meaning. In essence, the
                            problem comes down to this: how can the U.S. most effectively use trade
                            policy as an instrument in the conduct of its affairs with the <gloss

                                complete denial of, trade with the U.S. can affect Soviet
                                capabilities to wage war—either hot or cold war. Nor can either

                                <p>The most that can be said for trade with the industrial West as a
                                    whole is that it provides a useful element of flexibility to
                                    Bloc planning and perhaps adds a lubricating quality to the

                                <p>In these terms U.S. trade alone, which is all that is relevant to

                                    significance. Present U.S. trade with the Bloc is small enough
                                    to be completely disregarded.</p>
                                <p>If the U.S. removed restrictions and traded with the Bloc on the

                                    Payments difficulties, however, would set sharp limits on this

                                cold war conditions is so significant that the policy would be
                                difficult to do without, or even to modify, as long as those
                                conditions continue. In a situation of unyielding confrontation
                                between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                                there can be no question of giving quarter, psychological or

                                change in the policy in such circumstances would constitute an
                                important shift in the over-all U.S. political stance, and would
                                impair U.S. effectiveness in holding up its end of the cold war.
                                Moreover a change under static conditions would be difficult to
                                justify to the American public and to the Congress.</item>

                            <item>The usefulness of the restrictive policy is, however, solely the
                                product of a static situation in the cold war. All the criteria that
                                underlie and justify the policy are the criteria of warfare in the
                                traditional sense. These criteria presuppose that for the time being
                                at least we cannot protect ourselves or promote our interests by
                                normal methods, that we are in a position where we have no choice
                                but to resort to “the continuation of politics by other

                                of direct strategic importance, would fall away. At the same time,
                                the control policy would be particularly useful, and almost uniquely
                                so, as a means of furthering the movement process. <list>

                                        The Soviet leaders have made clear they equate “peaceful
                                        relations” with “trade relations;” they would insist on
                                        consideration of controls in any serious negotiations; and
                                        they would consider U.S. attitudes on this issue as a
                                        decisive test of U.S. intentions.</item>

                                        will. At the same time, once a new start had been made on
                                        trade, the U.S. for the first time since the war's end would

                                must be a matter of political judgment based on both objective and
                                subjective considerations. On the one hand, there would need to be
                                concrete evidence of Soviet interest in generally improved relations
                                with the U.S. and of Soviet willingness to take, on the basis of
                                mutual concessions, the specific steps necessary to effect this
                                improvement. On the other hand, the situation should be such as to
                                indicate that discussion of the trade issue would be a logical and
                                fruitful, perhaps necessary, means of adding significant momentum to
                                the forward movement that had been gotten underway. As a rule of
                                thumb, it can be said that the U.S. should wait for the <gloss

                                showed at the same time a genuine desire to proceed with a serious
                                and fruitful discussion of other matters, including those that most
                                closely press in on immediate U.S. security interests, the U.S.
                                should agree to a mutual review of “obstacles to improved trade and
                                general intercourse” between the two nations. Final modification of

                                discretionary authority had been granted the President, would be
                                left to a later and more decisive stage in the negotiation

                                need do so not in terms of a simple abandonment of the system but in
                                terms of replacing it with another. Despite the likely absence of
                                any large volume of trade between the U.S. and the Bloc, even under
                                relaxed conditions, it would not be in either our commercial or

                            limited and wasting asset for a still limited but growing asset. The
                            main hope for such a fortuitous turn would lie in the possibility that
                            even as a minor trade partner of the several Bloc countries the U.S.
                            would be better able to influence the course of events and the evolution

                            term, would be modest at best; but they could be of very considerable
                            significance in the case of the Satellites. We have good reason to

                            the U.S. to shape the course of these events. In any case, from the

                            <item>The U.S. should in this circumstance also undertake, through
                                advance consultation, to prepare the ground with our allies for a
                                change in U.S. policy. In these consultations, we should discuss any
                                implications that a change in U.S. policy would have on the
                                multilateral system of controls and any changes that might be
                                required to maintain collective surveillance and control of
                                strategic commodities as multilaterally defined. In keeping with the
                                objective of using trade more effectively for political purposes, we
                                should seek a closer understanding with our Allies whereby we would
                                collectively restrict or cut-off trade as a means of response to
                                Soviet-initiated crises.</item>

                        <p>The first draft talked in common-sensible terms about the character of
                            our present trade policy toward the Soviets—emphasizing that its primary
                            considerations were largely political rather than strategic or economic
                            and recognizing that trade provided useful political leverage in dealing
                            with the Soviets. But its recommendations, in effect, denied the use of
                            trade as an instrument for political bargaining. It set as a
                            pre-condition for a modification of our present policy “concrete
                            evidence of Soviet interest in generating improved relations with the
                            U.S. and of Soviet willingness to take, on the basis of mutual
                            concessions, specific steps necessary to effect this improvement.”</p>
                        <p>This perhaps is unchallengeable as a statement of abstract principle, but
                            as an operating guideline its value is questionable because it leaves
                            little or no maneuvering ground for useful political bargaining.</p>
                        <p>It is not enough to say the trade question should be reconsidered <hi
                                rend="italic">after</hi> the Soviets have taken specific steps to
                            bring about an improvement in the existing situation. Improvement will
                            only be possible by some give and take on both sides, and it is
                            unrealistic to suggest that the other side must first demonstrate its
                            good intentions before we can consider meeting them part way. For it is
                            in the give and take process that the intention of the other side can be
                            ascertained.</p>
                        <p>No one can seriously assert that our present relationship with Moscow can
                            properly be characterized as “detente” or “rapprochement.” Whether
                            either of these is in the cards remains to be seen. But the indisputable
                            fact is that there is movement—the first in a long time—and there is an
                            obligation on our part to attempt to ascertain its course and assess its
                            significance.</p>
                        <p>In this context, it makes little sense to assert that insofar as the
                            possible use of trade in this bargaining exercise is concerned, the only
                            real alternative is to wait and see what the other side does. Some
                            waiting and seeing is called for. But carried on over a prolonged
                            period, it will not produce much. If there is to be progress, there must
                            be movement on both sides, and there is no convincing argument for
                            excluding trade from the dialogue if it provides useful leverage.</p>
                        <p>In this context, it is important to define the kinds of trade and trade
                            restrictions we are talking about.</p>
                        <p>There were the restrictions on crabmeat which were lifted early in this
                            Administration. The impact of this action was largely psychological.
                            Politically and economically it did little either for us or the Soviets
                            except to clear away something which had only nuisance value.</p>
                        <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0753"/>
                        <p>At the other end of the spectrum there are broad legal restrictions in
                            the form of multilateral agreements (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss>) and legislation—the Battle and Johnson Acts. And
                            there is little that can be done about these limitations since this
                            clearly is not the time to seek modification either of the multilateral
                            agreements or legislation.</p>
                        <p>But in between the crabmeat exercise and the treaty and legislative
                            barriers, there is also a considerable area of potential activity that
                            is controlled by administrative action—export licensing. Its character
                            depends on the way the Secretary of Commerce's discretionary licensing
                            authority is used. Historically, the restrictions have been severe and
                            rigid because the political decision was taken to keep trade with the
                            Communists at an absolute minimum. As a consequence, the United States
                            has less trade today with the Soviet Union than any of its major Western
                            European Allies.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets, of course, are not interested in trade in general; they are
                            interested in specific kinds of trade—selected heavy industrial goods
                            and industrial plants. Khrushchev, in his conversations with the
                            Secretary and Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Harriman</persName>,
                            talked about the possibilities of buying American chemical plant
                            equipment. In other contexts, the Soviets have talked about buying tire
                            plants and transportation equipment. All of these commodities, the
                            experts have assured me, can actually be sold to the Soviets now, if a
                            political decision were taken to do so. They are not <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> items; nor do they appear on any
                            other trade ban list. They merely require an export license which is
                            within the Secretary of Commerce's discretion to issue.</p>
                        <p>One “expert” has said that if the political climate is right and the
                            political decision is taken to lift—to whatever degree is deemed
                            desirable—East-West trade barriers, what needs to be done is “to
                            liberalize export licensing, and let them (the Soviets) come and shop up
                            to their ability to pay, by normal marketing of their commodities, gold
                            sales, or settlement in foreign exchange earned elsewhere.”</p>
                        <p>But the exercise is somewhat more complicated, for as pariahs in our
                            market place, the Soviets have several additional problems to contend
                            with: <list>

                                <item>The Soviets and their satellites are not entitled to <gloss

                                    get them) and therefore must face unequal competition.</item>

                                    satellites have to contend with importer and consumer

                                <item>Moreover, the Soviets and their satellites do not have easy
                                    access to credits. The Battle and Johnson Acts cut off the most
                                    important sources, although by recent rulings on the Johnson
                                    Act, the Justice <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0754"

                            </list></p>
                        <p>And over and above these, there are several political factors which must
                            also be taken into account. Assuming that the licensing and payment
                            problems can be dealt with, the fact is if trade with the Bloc should
                            reach substantial proportions before the necessary political groundwork
                            is laid on Capitol Hill—even though legislative requirements are not
                            directly involved—the entire operation could boomerang and complicate
                            rather than help the situation. Moreover, at some point in any
                            large-scale trade exercise with the Soviets, lend-lease is almost
                            certain to rear its head and create political, if not legal,
                            complications.</p>
                        <p>Having said all this, the essential points are: <list>

                                    certain to arise again and at the very least we should be

                                    consider liberalizing existing trade arrangements if the
                                    political developments were right—that we would be prepared to

                                    we remain alert to political developments and aware of the
                                    importance of not holding back so long that an opportunity for

                            meeting by saying that he had drafted a letter to the President<note

                            memorandum addressed to the Export Control Review Board of May 16,
                                1963.<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2"><ref target="#d322">Document
                                    322</ref>.</note> He asked Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJN1">Behrman</persName> to review the background of the
                            proposals to the President and then asked for comment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> indicated he had no
                            adverse comments on the report itself but offered his views about the
                            current state of Soviet policy and US-<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> relations and about the place of trade relations in
                            our over-all relations with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>He cautioned, first of all, against being swept away by excessive
                            optimism. Soviet foreign policy has appeared to change before. Each
                            time, however, hostility toward the West has come to the surface again.
                            Present comparatively friendly attitudes could change overnight. The
                            break between Communist China and the Soviet Union seems to be genuine
                            but we cannot be certain about its durability. There could be a reversal
                            of Chinese or Soviet attitudes and a restoration of the Sino-Soviet
                            common front against the West.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            said, Soviet policy probably is in a state of flux. It is often said
                            that we must wait for a change in “the atmosphere” before we take steps
                            in trade relations or in other matters to ease our relations with the
                            Soviets. The trouble with that axiom is that the things that we say
                            should not be changed without a change in the atmos-phere are the very
                            elements that make up the atmosphere. In our trade relations with the
                            Soviets and the European Soviet Bloc, he said, we should begin actively
                            to probe and explore. There is plenty of room for scouting the terrain,
                            he thought, as for example, by being ready to sell fertilizer plants and
                            other items. Our willingness to sell certain kinds of advanced plant
                            equipment for cash, even without pushing for relaxation <pb n="730"
                                xml:id="pg_730" facs="0756"/>of the existing ban on longer term
                            credits, would be a signal to the Soviets of our willingness to move
                            ahead on a fair basis. We need not rush too far or too fast. There is
                            much exploration and scouting to be done before we will be ready to
                            negotiate a bilateral trade agreement, although such an agreement may
                            indeed be the end product of our explorations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> pointed out that
                            American businessmen frequently cannot understand the fact that,
                            although Western Europe was trading with Russia in an increasing amount,
                            we were still maintaining a very tight restriction on such trade. In
                            reply Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            pointed out that differences exist between European attitudes toward
                            trade with the Bloc in that there has been a closer historical
                            connection and a heavier reliance on trade by the Europeans than by the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> mentioned that
                            Khrushchev had said to him, on the question of trade, that both sides
                            should get an advantage. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> thought that we sometimes tend to forget this
                            truism. In loosening our trade controls, we should be watchful, not only
                            to see that we are making satisfactory trade exchanges but also to be
                            sure that progress is being made in other areas. At the moment, Rumania
                            seems to be ripe for a push toward better relations. We should be
                            forthcoming promptly on a number of trade items in which Rumania is
                            interested. If, then, the hoped-for improvement in our relations takes
                            place, we should liberalize further.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the question of the Soviet Union itself, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> expressed the view that it was
                            almost inevitable that Ambassador Dobrynin will raise the trade issue
                            when he begins his talks with him. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName> agreed and referred to the invitation to Under
                            Secretary of Commerce Roosevelt to visit the Soviet Union as indicating
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s interest in expanded trade.
                            He went on to say that he is frequently asked by American businessmen
                            why the Europeans can sell such large amounts to the Soviet Union while
                            Americans are restricted in their access to the Soviet market. In
                            effect, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> said,
                            they are asking whether we are right and the Europeans wrong about
                            proper trade policy toward the Soviet Bloc. He mentioned in this context
                            Soviet statements that a U.S. export market of $1-1/2 billion per year
                            could be developed in the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>There was a general discussion of the possibilities of the Soviet market.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> both stressed the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s payment problem and the limits
                            which this sets on the Soviet purchases. The Soviets seem to be
                            unwilling to expand imports by gold sales and for the most part resist
                            multilateral balancing of trade in favor of fairly strict bilateral
                            equivalence. Furthermore, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> noted, the Johnson Act prevents us from extending
                            credits of up to five years which the European suppliers do provide. The
                            Johnson Act thus sets the limits on exports to the Soviet Union at
                            fairly low levels.</p>
                        <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0757"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked about the
                            recommendation that a U.S. Commercial Corporation be formed to conduct
                            trade with the Soviet Union. He expressed his own misgivings about this
                            idea. Mr. Wyman asked how otherwise we could get a quid pro quo for our
                            sales to the Soviets. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1"
                                >Ball</persName> observed that this could be achieved through a
                            bilateral trade agreement, to the extent that private firms were not
                            able to hold up their end in bargaining. He pointed out that the
                            Europeans had not found it necessary to establish governmental agencies
                            to conduct trade with the Soviets and he wondered if we needed to
                            conform our economy to that of the Soviet Union in order to conduct
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the problem of credits, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> said that he would be willing to consider the
                            legislative action needed to liberalize our position if we could have
                            credit liberalization accompanied by a Lend-Lease settlement. Secretary
                            Hodges thought a Lend-Lease settlement well worth exploring. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> and Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, in response
                            to a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName>, said that to him the question of trade relations
                            with the Soviet Bloc was “purely a foreign policy matter.” He had
                            thought for years that we have been misjudging and grossly
                            overestimating the impact of our trade controls on Soviet military
                            power. While the controls undoubtedly commend themselves to the body of
                            American opinion and in political terms are probably necessary, the fact
                            is that peaceful trade between the United States and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would tend on the whole to mold the
                            Soviet Union in the Western image. He felt that it should be U.S. policy
                            to seek to alter Soviet attitudes and he thought that a positive
                            attitude toward trade was an important aspect of such a policy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed noting that a
                            recent U.S. Congressional delegation to Russia had come out in favor of
                            a greater exploration of the possibilities of trade. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> noted that even two members of
                            the Kitchin investigating committee indicated that they were willing to
                            expand trade on a quid pro quo basis.</p>
                        <p>In another brief exchange with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1"
                                >Hodges</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> mentioned some of the small indicators for a change
                            for the better in Soviet attitudes toward the West, such as the end of
                            jamming of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_BBC1">BBC</gloss> broadcasts, and an apparent increase in
                            Soviet receptivity to scientific exchanges. He thought that there may be
                            basic reasons for a change in the Soviet viewpoint toward the West and
                            in Soviet policy. One, of course, was the conflict with Communist China,
                            but there was also, first the increasing awareness among the Soviet
                            leaders of the awful hazards of atomic conflict and, second, a desire,
                            at least on the part of Mr. Khru-shchev to make progress toward the
                            solution of internal economic problems, foremost of which is a conflict
                            between enormous expenditures on <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0758"
                            />the military budget and the goal of higher living standards for the
                            Russian people.</p>
                        <p>A number of possible actions were then discussed:</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> said that it was his
                            impression that there was considerable interest in the Congress in the
                            question of trade with the Soviets. The Senators who had accompanied him
                            to Moscow had mentioned the matter and Senator Williams of Delaware had
                            asked for an assurance that the test ban pact had not been accompanied
                            by an understanding on a trade agreement. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> thought that he, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>, and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> should explore
                            informally with the Hill leadership the whole area of trade with the
                            Bloc, not in relation to any immediate legislative requests, but as a
                            means of keeping the Congress informed of the possibilities for a
                            changed U.S. position in trade matters. This suggestion was accepted by
                            the other Secretaries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> then suggested that
                            after he had begun his talks with Dobrynin, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName> join them some Saturday
                            afternoon for discussions in a relaxed atmosphere, perhaps on a boat on
                            the Potomac. This proposal was also agreed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> asked that in
                            addition to the studies proposed in the recommendations to the
                            President, the agencies concerned take a close look at the possibilities
                            for purchases from the Soviet Union and at the whole Soviet payments
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that it
                            appeared that we could proceed promptly to liberalize trade with the
                            satellites, whatever the decision about the Soviet Union itself.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> agreed and said
                            that Rumania was the most immediate matter to be looked at. He thought,
                            also, that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HLH1">Hodges</persName>
                            should have “something in his pocket” for his forthcoming visit to
                            Czechoslovakia. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName>
                            thought that the Czechoslovakians may be ready for expanded trade with
                            the United States, since international trade represents a very large
                            factor in the Czechoslovakian economy.</p>
                        <p>At this point there was a brief discussion of press inquiries. It was
                            agreed that the agencies concerned should not, at this stage, give
                            backgrounders or otherwise talk to the press about an increased U.S.
                            interest in Soviet trade possibilities.</p>
                        <p>The three Secretaries agreed that the report drafted in response to the
                            President should be forwarded and each signed the letter of
                            transmittal.</p>

                                            of technically-advanced machinery and equipment in a

                                            national security issue is presented, we of course deny
                                            an export license. There are, however, many cases in
                                            which no clear security issue arises and yet we know
                                            that the Soviets are using American machinery and
                                            equipment as a basis for copying our technology. Are we
                                            being adequately compensated in these sales?</p>
                                        <p>"Is there any method of organizing these transactions
                                            which would secure a better quid pro quo than the
                                            present method of leaving it to the individual seller to
                                            secure the best price he can in the transaction, in
                                            light of the fact the Soviet Union does not ordinarily
                                            respect the patent and copyright arrangements on which
                                            we rely in our commercial transactions with other

                                    <item>"2. Should we reconsider the whole of our trade with the
                                        Soviet Union in the light of trade between Western Europe
                                        and the Soviet Union and its European satellites?
                                        Considering the character and volume of that trade, would a
                                        generally less restrictive policy be more in keeping with
                                        the interests of the United States? How much possibility is
                                        there for a significant broadening of trade that is
                                        consistent with our security interests? Would this
                                        possibility be such as to justify a general negotiation on
                                        trade and commercial matters with the Soviet Union?”</item>

                                U.S.-Soviet trade should be negotiated and undertaken only in the

                                        with the present negotiating situation. There is, however,
                                        little to be gained from a serious extension of the controls
                                        or a serious relaxation of them on a unilateral basis.</p>

                            of propositions on East-West trade to be approved by the <pb n="738"

                            Their recommendations are in response to a Presidential request of May
                            16, 1963 (Tab B).<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2"><ref target="#d322"

                        <p>Their recommendations generally provide license for expanded East-West
                            trade and more flexibility for managing this trade. The next step is to
                            transfer the further responsibility in this exercise to the operators to
                            put these recommendations into a meaningful political context. As I see
                            it, this should result in giving <persName corresp="#p_HWA2">Averell
                                Harriman</persName> the mandate to come up with proposals for using
                            trade as a lever for developing our relations with the Soviet Union and
                            the Soviet satellites.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Export Control Review Board's specific recommendations are
                            concerned, the key passages are nos. 2 and 3. They call upon Commerce to
                            tidy up its licensing practices to insure that these do not weaken the
                            future negotiating posture of the U.S., and also recognize possible
                            advantages in liberalizing existing practices to permit better
                            exploitation of the changing situation in the Communist world.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation #1 calls for a special study by the Export Control Review
                            Board of the problem of “adequate compensation for U.S. technology.”
                            This could be useful and I see no reason for discouraging it.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation #5 proposes that the Review Board study the advisability
                            of establishing a U.S. commercial corporation to provide a stronger
                            institutional base for conducting East-West trade under the conditions
                            of expanding trade. This, too, might produce something constructive and
                            the Board should be instructed to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>However, I am reluctant about recommendations 4, 6 and 7. Recommendation
                            4 suggests that the Review Board prepare “on an urgent basis a
                            contingency plan for negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.” I appreciate the possible
                            advantages of such an enterprise, but I do not think we are quite ready
                            for this step yet and I do not think it would be useful to have the
                            departments become energetically engaged in such enterprise. It could
                            not be kept under wraps long and would not only get in the way of
                            domestic politics; it would get in the way of negotiations with the
                            Soviets. For the same general reasons, I have even greater qualms about
                            seeking Congressional action to eliminate present legislative
                            restrictions on East-West trade (Recommendation 6) and going to our
                            Allies to review <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> (Recommendation
                            7). The experts in the field believe we already have sufficient leeway
                            and authority to deal with the problem (via licensing) and even credit
                            arrangements, limited as they are, are adequate to cope with the first
                            anticipated increases in trade. If there is progress in East-West trade,
                            these things will have to be dealt with in a more comprehensive fashion.
                            But at this point our emphasis <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0765"
                            />should be on utilizing the discretionary authority the Executive
                            branch already has and the credit arrangements which already exist and
                            which, in fact, have been liberalized by Justice Department's rulings.

                        <p>In summary, recommendations 1, 2, 3 and 5 should go on to the President
                            for approval and recommendations 4, 6 and 7 should be shelved for the
                            present. With this action out of the way, it should be possible to go
                            ahead with the more important part of the exercise—determining how trade
                            leverage might be usefully exploited with the Communist Bloc.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned in two previous memoranda (Tab C and D),<note n="4"

                            order and magnitude than trade with the Soviet Union. The two are not
                            tied together; nor should one wait upon the other.</p>
                        <p>In the case of the satellites, our purpose is to establish broader
                            Western ties with them, giving them an alternative to the Soviets for
                            their economic development and political relations. Go ahead signals
                            have already been given in the case of Rumania because of developments
                            there. But there are interesting opportunities in other Bloc states as
                            well—including Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and even Albania.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Soviet side of the picture is concerned, there is an
                            important place for the trade item in moving along the dialogue—which
                            already includes such items as security (non-aggression pacts,
                            observation posts, etc.), Germany and Berlin.</p>
                        <p>All this requires a hard look at the political problems at a high level,
                            by someone with sufficient authority and prestige to direct the
                            exercise, not only through the Department of State, but also through the
                            other interested Government agencies—e.g., <persName corresp="#p_HWA2"

                                    this program into action, and after further consultation I
                                    expect to designate such a person. I should be glad to have

                                go forward with the studies suggested in the first, fourth, fifth
                                and sixth recommendations. Further, the studies and other staff work
                                described in the seventh recommendation should be undertaken under

                        <p>At his news conference on October 9, 1963, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> stated that the U.S. Government
                            would not prohibit sales of surplus wheat to the Soviet Union and
                            various East European countries by American private grain dealers at the
                            regular world price for dollars or gold, either cash on delivery or
                            normal commercial terms. He said that he had decided this after
                            consulting with the National Security Council and informing the
                            appropriate leaders of Congress. He added that “the wheat we sell to the
                            Soviet Union will be carried in available American ships, supplemented
                            by ships of other countries as required.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> also stated that
                            “this particular decision does not represent a new Soviet-American trade
                            policy,” but “it did represent one more hopeful sign that a more
                            peaceful world is both possible and beneficial to us all.” He pointed
                            out that “to the extent that their limited supplies of gold, dollars,
                            and foreign exchange must be used for food, they cannot be used to
                            purchase military or other equipment.” (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers

                            776-778) Released with the letter was the opinion of the Department of

                            act of Congress. (Letter from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to

                        <p>Assuming that the President's announcement of U.S. willingness to sell
                            wheat to the Soviet bloc might raise questions about U.S. East-West
                            trade policy, the Department of State circularized to its posts abroad
                            an expression of U.S. policy on East-West economic relationships as
                            background for responses to official inquiries. It stated that the
                            United States was exploring the possibility of modifying U.S.
                            restrictions on non-strategic trade with the European Soviet bloc on a
                            basis more comparable with other trading countries. Trade would be used
                            to take advantage of current trends in East European states and to
                            enhance the range of communication with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The circular telegram stated that the approach on economic problems would
                            be “considered within the context overall U.S. relationship <pb n="742"
                                xml:id="pg_742" facs="0768"/>with European Communist countries.” It
                            pointed out that signature of the nuclear test ban treaty and other
                            disarmament discussions had not ended the cold war. “Soviet leaders will
                            hold uncompromising positions on such matters as Berlin and continue to
                            make clear ultimate goal of world communism and advocate what they term
                            ‘national liberation movements of oppressed peoples.'” The United States
                            therefore adhered to its basic East-West economic policy, which the
                            circular telegram then outlined. (Circular telegram 688 to 112 Embassies

                        <p>During consideration of the foreign assistance authorization bill (H.R.
                            7885, 88th Cong.) on November 14, Senator Karl E. Mundt (R.-S.D.)
                            offered an amendment to prohibit the Export-Import Bank from
                            guaranteeing or extending credit to any Communist country for the
                            purchase of U.S. grain. President <persName corresp="#p_KJF2"
                                >Kennedy</persName> urged “in the strongest terms” that the Senate
                            not approve this amendment. (Letter from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> to Senator Mike Mansfield

                            Trade, East/West) On the same day, Senator Mundt withdrew his proposal
                            after the Senate leadership agreed to consider it in a separate bill.
                            That bill (S. 2310, 88th Cong.) would have banned Export-Import Bank
                            credit and credit guarantees to Communist countries for purchase of any
                            U.S. commodity, but it failed of adoption in the Senate on November
                            26.</p>
                        <p>The House of Representatives approved a similar ban in the foreign aid
                            appropriation bill for fiscal year 1964 (H.R. 9499, 88th Cong.),
                            December 16, but the Senate rejected it on December 19. On December 24,
                            the House of Representatives agreed to the foreign aid appropriation
                            conference report (H. Rept. 1091, 88th Cong.) with a provision that left
                            to the President's discretion authorization of Export-Import Bank credit
                            or credit guarantees to Communist countries if he determined it was in
                            the national interest and reported each determination to Congress within
                            30 days. The Senate approved the conference report on December 30.
                            Presidential discretionary authority to approve Export-Import Bank
                            credits to Communist countries thus became part of the Foreign Aid and

                            purpose, and it is his understanding that under the direction of the

                            will be prepared to discuss the general question of United States-Soviet
                            trade relations as well as the specific problem of wheat sales. The
                            Ambassador agreed that the first discussion on this subject might be
                            held in the middle of next week, in an unpublicized manner, and, for the
                            first meeting, would be held to two or three persons on each side.<note

                            have in mind as to the scope of the negotiations. The following appear
                            to be the chief elements of the problem:</p>

                                    whether, in these discussions, we will seek a major settlement
                                    of trade problems or simply some modest expansion through
                                    liberalizing current restrictions without involving

                                    expressed to him the opinion that we probably could not reach a
                                    broad settlement of trade problems, including legislative
                                    action, until after our elections. I think this is probably
                                    recognized by the Soviet side. On the other hand, there have
                                    recently been indications that they would consider a lend-lease
                                    settlement which could conceivably open the way to a major deal.
                                    The Soviets have always stated they were seeking the end of any
                                    discrimination against them in the trade field. The only
                                    important fields of discrimination are the denial of
                                    Most-Favored-Nation treatment, the restrictions on credit by the
                                    Johnson Act, and controls on arms and strategic
                                items.</p></item>

                                the extension of credit by private firms to the Soviet Union for the
                                sale of industrial plants for three and possibly even five years.
                                Our Allies are now giving or guaranteeing credits up to five years
                                for such equipment, and we are now engaged in an exercise in <gloss

                                longer credit terms which the British, in particular, are inclined
                                to give. If the Soviets thought they could get credit from us for as
                                much as five years, they would probably have less interest in a
                                lend-lease settlement, although they will still wish to obtain
                                    <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment. To remove the
                                prohibitions of the Johnson Act with respect to the Soviet Union, it
                                would be necessary to arrive at a lend-lease settlement as well as
                                the settlement of certain Government loans in default. These could,
                                of course, be included in the lend-lease settlement.</item>

                            <item><hi rend="italic">Lend-lease Settlement</hi>. The last Soviet
                                offer of a lend-lease settlement was for three hundred million

                                including ships furnished to the Soviet Union. When we attempted to
                                renew negotiations in January 1960, the Soviets attempted to make a
                                condition of settlement, the simultaneous conclusion of a trade
                                agreement giving <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to
                                the Soviet Union and the granting by the United States Government of

                                do not think we can expect them to settle their lend-lease accounts.
                                It would seem to me that we might, however, reach an agreement

                            Act of 1963 (P.L. 88-205; 77 Stat. 379), which, among other things,

                            imports from Poland and Yugoslavia. Section 231 of the Trade Expansion
                            Act of 1962 (P.L. 87-794, approved on October 11, 1962; 76 Stat. 872)
                            had required the denial of such tariffs to products of Communist
                            countries, “as soon as practicable.” This had not yet been done.</p>

                        <p>Lord Hood said that he was not prepared to go into the details or the
                            technicalities of oil, but rather wished to discuss the subject in
                            general terms. Energy was, of course, vital to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> economy, and of all the energy sources
                            oil was the most important. Moreover, oil's share of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> energy market was constantly increasing.
                            Not only must the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> import this large
                            amount of oil, but it has a further interest in that earnings from its
                            oil companies were very important to the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> international payments position. A significant aspect of
                            the oil situation was that production, refining, transportation and
                            marketing were largely centralized in seven international oil
                            companies—five US owned, one <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and the
                            other half <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and half Dutch. Oil was
                            thus largely controlled by Anglo-American firms and is identified as
                            such in the outside world.</p>
                        <p>Lord Hood felt that it was very important for our two countries to keep
                            in touch with respect to the oil situation, particularly since in their
                            view our difficulties were likely to increase. He said that they thought
                            it necessary for our two governments to provide political guidance to
                            the oil companies and government backing when free world oil was
                            threatened. The principal problem areas were as follows: <list>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that we could
                            readily agree on problems 1 and 2, but he was not so sure about the
                            question of political guidance to private companies. We have always had
                            difficulty here because of our antitrust laws. The difficulty over the
                            Iranian arrangement was mentioned as a case in point. He added that we
                            probably could not expect any radical change in our policy on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nichols said that there was a general appreciation in the US that the
                            historical basis for the orderly distribution and marketing of oil was
                            undergoing change. Our oil companies, however, have a history of doing a
                            fairly good job in adjusting to and managing the changing situation
                            themselves. He said that in Europe there was continuous discussion of
                            energy policy by government bodies. The situation there was complicated
                            by the rivalry between different energy sources, particularly oil and
                            coal, and by the unusual degree of public ownership. We ourselves
                            participated in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> oil study
                            group which was now completing a comprehensive report on the problem of
                            Soviet oil in relation to Western interests. It was anticipated that the
                            report, which should prove to be a very useful document, will be turned
                            over to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> economic advisers in
                            about five weeks.<note n="1" xml:id="d336fn1">Not found.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> said that Ambassador
                            Thompson, in recent talks here, stated that over the next ten years we
                            should be prepared to face greatly increased Soviet capabilities in the
                            economic field. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> added
                            that the West may have to organize to meet the threat of increased
                            economic warfare, perhaps along lines similar to the wartime effort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> observed that while he
                            agreed that bilateral discussions should be held, it seemed that much
                            could also be done in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forum.
                            Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> replied that he agreed
                            with this, and pointed to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            study as being very useful in pulling all the threads together.</p>
                        <p>Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> asked if we agreed that
                            our Governments may have to give backing to the oil companies. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> replied in the
                            affirmative. Mr. Meyer asked if the British had anything specific in
                            mind. Lord <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> said that
                            Indonesia was a good example, and possibly even Venezuela and Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nichols observed that in some areas there were policy questions which
                            go beyond oil that may have to be settled. He said that, for example,
                            large pipe had been taken off the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> list some time ago, and <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754"
                                facs="0780"/>since then imported pipe had been of great use to the
                            U.S.S.R. in building oil pipe lines to the West. This may be a matter
                            for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> consideration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> asked if the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had had any thoughts on how to bring the
                            Italian concern Mattei back under control. This firm was very useful to
                            the Soviets as a means of breaking into Western oil markets. Lord
                                <persName corresp="#p_HVS1">Hood</persName> replied in the
                            negative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meyer, referring to the question of guidance to oil companies, said
                            that we do talk to our oil companies from time to time about their
                            problems around the world, and they are usually cooperative since they
                            consider themselves as being in the same boat. Perhaps the greatest
                            problem is in educating the companies' home offices.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3">Rusk</persName> opened the
                            conversation by stating that the Administration accepted a 21-month

                            felt it of great importance that the bill, as submitted by Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName>,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d337fn1">H.R. 3738, 87th Cong., introduced by Representative
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Harold D. Cooley</persName>
                                (D.-N.C.) on February 2</note> be amended to give the President
                            discretionary power with respect to that portion of the Cuban quota
                            which might otherwise have to be allocated to the Dominican
                            Republic.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary based this letter request primarily on the serious
                            potential threat to United States and hemisphere security which is
                            presented <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0781"/>by the present
                            situation in Cuba. He indicated that it was essential to take vigorous
                            action to prevent the Castro regime from continuing its efforts to upset
                            peaceful and friendly regimes in Latin America and from becoming a more
                            serious military threat to the United States. A number of steps were
                            under consideration to this end. To be effective it was essential that
                            we have at least understanding and in some cases active cooperation from
                            the other members of the Organization of American States. It was also
                            necessary to have their cooperation and sympathy if we were to succeed
                            in other measures which we wish to take in Latin America in order to
                            establish more firmly regimes in those countries which are friendly to
                            the United States and able to resist Communist infiltration from
                            whatever source it may come.</p>
                        <p>To many of these Latin American countries, led by Venezuela, the
                            Dominican Republic presents an equally serious threat to their
                            stability. Failure of the United States to see the problem of Trujillo
                            as a threat equally as serious as Castro will deprive us of the support
                            and sympathy which we need. The attempt on the life of the President of
                            Venezuela, which was organized in the Dominican Republic with Trujillo's
                            help, stands out as an illustration to them of his threat.</p>
                        <p>To these people it is incomprehensible that the United States should be
                            willing to punish Castro by not buying sugar in Cuba and then turn to
                            the Dominican Republic to replace much of it. It is a windfall and a
                            reward when they think only punishment is justified.</p>
                        <p>From a United States standpoint, we are also concerned about the current
                            political activities of Trujillo. His propaganda machine, which is well
                            financed, is extremely active and a cause of concern to our intelligence
                            agencies. His publicity has become violently anti-American and
                            sympathetic to many Soviet interests. There is evidence that his regime
                            is in contact with Soviet bloc and Castro representatives.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName> inquired
                            whether it wasn't true that the Latin American countries had not
                            supported us in the Organization of American States on action against
                            Cuba and wasn't it desirable that they evidence this support before we
                            take the action they want vis-a-vis the Dominican Republic. The
                            Secretary agreed that we had not gotten all we had asked for, yet it had
                            been a step ahead and had been helpful. We did not think we could go to
                            them for support on the measures we now contemplated taking, much more
                            radical in nature, without having given them in advance evidence of our
                            good faith and intentions with respect to the Dominican Republic. He
                            pointed out that, while the <gloss target="#t_OAS1">OAS</gloss> had not
                            adopted resolutions specifically embargoing purchases of goods such as
                            sugar from the Dominican Republic, it had taken a number of concrete
                            measures in the trade field, whose spirit they felt would be abrogated
                            by United States windfall purchases in the Dominican Republic.</p>
                        <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0782"/>
                        <p>Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName>, McCormack and
                            Poage pressed a number of questions with respect to what we expected to
                            happen in the Dominican Republic if Trujillo was upset. Their great fear
                            was that this prevented an opportunity for a Castro-sponsored regime to
                            take over. The Secretary replied that our purpose was not to upset
                            Trujillo, though failure to purchase sugar above and beyond the quota
                            may well contribute to this end. If for this and other reasons, and
                            there was evidence of extensive discontent, Trujillo were upset, our
                            best guess was that a military regime would take over for a period.
                            There were a substantial number of citizens who were anti-Trujillo and
                            would cooperate, we thought, in any such regime. However, the brutality
                            and repressions of the dictatorship had prevented these groups from
                            effective organization. We felt there were military leaders who could
                            continue a stable regime and put down any attempt of a Castro-type
                            take-over, though, of course, we could give no guarantee as to the
                            future course of events.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName> indicated that
                            he had been discussing the problem of Dominican Republic sugar with a
                            number of people in recent days, including Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCB1">Bowles</persName>, Berle, Governor Munos Marin of
                            Puerto Rico and others. The three Congressmen had just returned from
                            lunch at the Venezuelan Embassy during which the Venezuelan and
                            Colombian Ambassadors had expressed strongly their views. Everyone he
                            had talked to had agreed with the Secretary that our Latin American
                            policy would be seriously prejudiced by continued United States
                            purchases of former Cuban quota sugar from the Dominican Republic. He
                            was, therefore, sympathetic to the idea of giving the President
                            discretionary authority. However, he thought it would be desirable in
                            order to secure an orderly transition and prevent a Castro-type
                            take-over if Trujillo could be persuaded that now was a good time for
                            him to retire to some quiet part of the world. He was known to have a
                            substantial fortune abroad. If he stayed on and provoked violent
                            revolution or if he started playing with the Communists, the first
                            target for either group would be himself and his fortune. He could be
                            told that he could not expect to sell sugar beyond the Dominican
                            Republic quota to United States so there were not additional gains to be
                            made in the near future. He should leave, call elections for 60 days
                            hence, and thus provide an orderly transition. Congressman Cooley
                            suggested that he knew some people who were close friends of Trujillo
                            and could carry such a message to him. They would be persuasive and he
                            thought he might listen to them. He thought this should be done before
                            any action was taken on sugar legislation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary protested strongly that there was not time to undertake
                            such a step, even if it were a wise thing to do, before enacting sugar
                            legislation. In addition he felt that the persuasiveness of any such
                            approach would be greatly increased if the President had already been
                            given discretionary authority to cut off the Dominican Republic
                            allotment <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0783"/>before Trujillo was
                            talked to. Otherwise, he could still hope that his friends in Washington
                            could save the day for him as they had in the past. The Speaker strongly
                            supported the Secretary on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to say that a similar mission had, he thought,
                            though of an unofficial character, talked to Trujillo not too long ago
                            without success. He did not know if this was a useful or practical idea.
                            He would wish to consult advisers who were better informed than he on
                            the subject of Dominican Republic situations. He could agree to explore
                            it, but that was all.</p>
                        <p>Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName> then raised the
                            question of the necessity of having an unallocated sugar quota available
                            to give to a new regime, either in Cuba or the Dominican Republic, in
                            order to provide it support. Such regimes might come into existence
                            before the end of the calendar year and, therefore, he thought it would
                            be desirable to have the sugar allocated on a quarterly basis so that we
                            would always have plenty in reserve. He thought that this presented some
                            problems to the Department of Agriculture. Mr.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> indicated that he agreed it would
                            pre-sent problems but that he thought if an arrangement, which was
                            otherwise satisfactory, could be worked out, these problems could
                            somehow be resolved.</p>
                        <p>The Speaker asked Congressman Hoeven his views on the Secretary's
                            request. Congressman Hoeven replied that he personally was glad to
                            support the position presented by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD3"
                                >Rusk</persName> which seemed to him substantially identical to that
                            which had been held by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> previously. He felt the Republican members of
                            the Committee would do the same and also the Republican Policy
                            Committee. Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName>
                            said that if the Secretary was prepared to explore the possibility of
                            making contact with Trujillo and recommending that he depart now and
                            with an understanding that an arrangement like a quarterly allocation
                            could be worked out to preserve a sugar quota for a new regime, he was
                            ready to support the Secretary's proposal for discretionary power to the
                            President. Congressman Poage agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then pointed out that he had said to them many things which
                            he could not say in a public hearing. There were also things which it
                            was awkward to even discuss in public hearings because what you did not
                            say became significant. He, therefore, wondered if it would be possible
                            for the Committee to report out the Bill without a hearing. Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName> said that this was the
                            way he preferred to handle it. He had talked to several of the
                            Democratic Congressmen and he thought they would go along with him
                            without the necessity of hearings, especially if he could pass on what
                            the Secretary said during their discussion. Congressman Hoeven was not
                            so sure, feeling that it was desirable to provide information to some of
                            the newer members of the Committee on the issues involved. It was left
                            that Congressman <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName> would
                            discuss <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0784"/>the need for a hearing
                            with the Committee when it organized but that in any case he would limit
                            the hearing to an executive session, probably with the Secretary only
                            appearing. He expressed the view that it would not be useful for anybody
                            below the Secretary to talk to the Committee. The Secretary said this
                            would be quite agreeable with him.</p>
                        <p>Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_CHD1">Cooley</persName> and Poage
                            pointed out there were also problems on the Senate side and that it
                            would be useful in their judgment if the Secretary could have a quiet
                            talk, similar to the one they had, with two or three of the leading
                            Senators, like Byrd and Ellender. The Secretary agreed to do this.</p>
                        <p>Congressman McCormack then asked a number of questions about Trujillo's
                            relations with the Soviets. He said if he were to reverse the position
                            he took last year, he would have to have evidence that there had been a
                            change in the situation and that the evidence which would interest him
                            most would relate to the Trujillo relationships with the Soviets. The
                            Secretary agreed to get further information on this point and present it
                            to the Congressman.</p>
                        <p>The Speaker in closing asked the Secretary to send him a letter with the
                            text of the amendment the Department proposed in the bill.<note n="2"

                            purchases from foreign governments through 1966. I believe the letter
                            adequately covers the points which the President, at the 1 February 1961
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, asked me to investigate

                        <p>You will note that most of the uranium purchases, involving a net dollar

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: This is to inform you
                                of the situation with respect to foreign uranium purchases. The
                                Atomic Energy Commission is obligated to purchase approximately
                                36,000 tons of uranium oxide between July 1, 1961 and December 31,
                                1966, involving a net dollar outlay of $700 million. Most of these
                                purchases will be made from Canada and the Union of South Africa,
                                countries now having foreign exchange problems. Both contracts have
                                recently been renegotiated to obtain the maximum benefit for the
                                United States. There is no reasonable expectation that further
                                deferment in purchases or payments could be negotiated. Barter of
                                surplus commodities for some South African uranium is a
                                possibility.</p>
                            <p>As shown on the attached tabulation,<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">Not
                                    printed.</note> the net payments for Canadian uranium will total
                                $370 million for deliveries under a contract with <pb n="760"
                                    xml:id="pg_760" facs="0786"/>Eldorado Mining and Refining
                                Limited, a Canadian Government corporation, and $325 million for
                                uranium from the Union of South Africa under a contract with the
                                South African Atomic Energy Board. In each case the Government
                                agency with which <gloss target="#t_AEC1">AEC</gloss> has its
                                contract has underlying contracts with private uranium producers.
                                The balance of the uranium (less than one percent, costing about $5
                                million) will come from small operations in Australia and
                                Portugal.</p>
                            <p>The Canadian contracts were recently revised to provide for a
                                stretch-out in uranium production and deliveries. Delivery of
                                approximately $140 million worth of uranium which would have been
                                delivered in 1961 and 1962 has been deferred to later years. All
                                deliveries are to be completed by the end of 1966. Had it not been
                                for the stretch-out, Canadian deliveries to the U.S. would have been
                                largely completed at the end of calendar 1962 with only minor
                                deliveries coming in 1963. Prior to the time the stretch-out
                                arrangement was agreed upon, the U.S. had notified the Canadian
                                Government that it did not intend to exercise its options to
                                purchase additional quantities of uranium and proposed that a
                                stretch-out be considered which would involve no additional costs
                                and no increase in the quantity of uranium being purchased. The
                                Commission's decision not to exercise its options, as well as the
                                stretch-out arrangement, posed major economic and political problems
                                for the Canadian Government. Although operations will continue over
                                a longer period, the stretch-out arrangement has cut the Canadian
                                industry roughly in half with many of the mines being closed. Under
                                the circumstances there is no reasonable prospect that further
                                deferrals could be obtained.</p>
                            <p>South African purchases were formerly made under a joint United
                                States-United Kingdom contract with the South African Atomic Energy
                                Board running through 1966. The U.S. bought two-thirds of the
                                production and the U.K. one-third. This arrangement has also been
                                recently revised to provide for separate AEC-South African and U.K.
                                Atomic Energy Authority-South African contracts, the quantities
                                remaining unchanged. The revised <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                >AEC</gloss>-South African contract provides for a $20 million
                                reduction in total cost and in a minor deferral of deliveries which
                                would have been made in F.Y. 1961 and 1962 totalling $7 million.
                                Under the new arrangement the U.K. will take most of its material
                                after 1966 but, because South Africa also has a foreign exchange
                                problem, will make substantial advances for each pound deferred. No
                                advances are involved in the <gloss target="#t_AEC1"
                                >AEC</gloss>-South African contract and all deliveries are to be
                                completed by December 31, 1966. The Commission decided not to extend
                                South African deliveries beyond 1966 because of possible problems
                                with domestic producers. Our present domestic uranium program
                                terminates December 31, 1966.</p>
                            <p>It is unlikely that a further stretch-out of South African deliveries
                                and payments can be negotiated. There is a possibility, however,
                                that <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0787"/>some portion of the
                                South African uranium could be paid for with surplus commodities,
                                provided the U.S. is willing, as an incentive, to purchase
                                additional quantities of uranium which it does not need. In prior
                                conversations, Commodity Credit Corporation indicated that the
                                amount of surplus commodities which might be involved in a barter
                                arrangement probably would not exceed $20 million annually. Part of
                                this would go to pay for the additional quantity of uranium which
                                might be involved.</p>
                            <p>The problems in attempting barter relate, first, to displacement of
                                U.S. cash sales of the commodities and, second, to displacement of
                                sales by friendly governments which also export the commodities
                                involved. The proposed barter program would undoubtedly cause
                                resentment on the part of Canada, particularly if it involved
                                additional uranium purchases—purchases which we refused to make from
                                Canada. Canada has already raised objections to this country's
                                agricultural barter program. Domestic producers also are likely to
                                raise objections to additional foreign uranium purchases since the
                                domestic program has been cut back.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the problems, we propose to explore the matter with
                                Commodity Credit Corporation and possibly the South Africans to see
                                what kind of arrangement might be worked out and to better define
                                any problems which may be involved.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> reported on his
                            recent trip to the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark and Sweden where he
                            undertook an on-the-spot appraisal of Soviet exports of oil, both as it
                            exists now and future trends. He said he was quite disturbed by his
                            findings. There is considerable interest in, and pressure for, increased
                            trade with the Soviets, with much of this pressure coming from business
                            interests. In order to expand trade with the Soviets, Western European
                            countries were being pressed to take increasing quantities of Soviet
                            oil, which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> thought
                            the Soviets were using as a tool in the cold war. Soviet oil is priced
                            to Western European countries considerably below oil from all other
                            sources, making it attractive to many countries. Western oil companies
                            could not compete with Soviet prices, since the latter did not have to
                            be based on economic considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States Government is concerned about
                            the increase in Soviet exports and is consulting closely with our Allies
                            on this problem. He asked for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1"
                                >Rathbone</persName>'s evaluation of Soviet oil reserves and
                            supplies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> said there was no
                            question but that the Soviets had very large reserves and could produce
                            5 million barrels of oil a day in the next three years. This compared
                            with current United States production of 7 million barrels a day and a
                            United States potential of 10 million barrels a day. He also felt that
                            internal Soviet consumption would not absorb Russian oil supplies,
                            particularly since the Soviets were developing the use of natural gas
                            for industry and would thus have large supplies of oil available for
                            export. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> thought the
                            Soviets were very well aware of the usefulness of oil in expanding their
                            trade and the potential mischief this could create in the West. In
                            Sweden, he said, approximately <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0789"
                            />50 percent of heavy industry depended on Soviet oil. Heavy reliance on
                            Soviet oil was dangerous, since it could lead to an undesirable
                            influence in government decisions affecting policy; it was an unreliable
                            source which the Soviets could manipulate to their advantage; it could
                            endanger the availability of oil from the Middle East, and have serious
                            political and strategic implications for the Middle East. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> considered it particularly
                            undesirable that close allies of the United States become significantly
                            dependent on the Soviets for their sources of oil.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName>
                            to expand on his discussions with the British, particularly his
                            conversation with Selwyn Lloyd. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1"
                                >Rathbone</persName> said that he had talked with Maudling,
                            following the latter's return from Moscow, and with Mr. Wood, the Power
                            Minister, who set up an appointment with him with Mr. Lloyd. Although
                            the British have so far resisted taking any significant quantities of
                            Soviet oil, they were under great pressure to import Soviet oil at their
                            recent trade negotiations with the Russians. They were successful in
                            holding off the Russians for another year on oil, telling them that they
                            had a surplus of oil and would be happy to sell some to the Russians.
                            According to both Maudling and Lloyd, however, it appeared unlikely that
                            the British would be able to hold off taking Russian oil beyond this
                            year, since they were under considerable pressure from their business
                            people to expand <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Soviet trade. The
                            question now appeared to be not whether the British would take Soviet
                            oil in the future, but how they would handle the oil
                            administratively.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lloyd had asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName>
                            what he thought would be the best way to handle imports of Russian oil.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> indicated he was not
                            in favor of the idea in principle, and there was no really good way of
                            handling it. He saw, however, three ways of distributing Russian oil in
                            the U.K., if this oil were taken: (1) let the companies using the oil
                            and the Soviets work it out directly; (2) have the Government take over
                            the oil and make arrangements for its distribution; and (3) turn the oil
                            over to the oil companies for their allocation to consumers. Of all
                            three approaches, he thought the third one would be most difficult, if
                            not impossible, for American companies due to United States anti-trust
                            laws. He thought the first approach was also bad, since it might result
                            in serious inequities. While the second approach also had difficulties,
                            it would be the least troublesome of the three.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> said that if the oil
                            companies undertook to distribute Soviet crude, there would be a great
                            out-cry from the Middle Eastern oil countries. The Secretary asked
                            whether the Middle Eastern countries have made diplomatic approaches to
                            the Western European countries who are taking substantial quantities of
                            Soviet oil. According to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1"
                                >Rathbone</persName>, practically nothing has been done by the
                            Middle Eastern countries, since half refuse to recognize the Soviet
                            danger and the others <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0790"/>do not
                            know what to do. He said some 25 million tons of Soviet oil were
                            exported to Western Europe last year, the bulk of which came directly
                            out of the Middle Eastern share. The Secretary then suggested that it
                            might be useful to stir up the Middle Eastern countries to make
                            approaches to the Western European countries and to make them aware of
                            the dangers to their own interests in the Soviet oil export trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> thought the United
                            States ought to take the following three lines of action to counter the
                            Soviet oil export drives: (1) instruct all our posts abroad on United
                            States policy in this field; (2) hold high level conversations with our
                            allies; and (3) exert “moderate pressure” on the less-developed
                            countries taking Soviet oil, in connection with United States aid
                            programs or loans. He understood the United States had taken action
                            along the lines of his first proposal and that discussions were going
                            forward in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1"
                                >Rathbone</persName> considered, however, that there was not
                            sufficient high level attention being given to the discussions with our
                            allies. The Secretary noted we were discussing this question on various
                            levels and that it would probably come up for discussion at the December
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial Meeting. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> thought December
                            might be too late and suggested a greater sense of urgency on this
                            problem. The Secretary said that the question was being currently dealt
                            with and that it would be involved in the Department's consultations on
                            Berlin which were going forward on a current basis.</p>
                        <p>The conversation turned to the subject of prices and the Secretary asked
                            what the influence of Sahara oil would be. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> said that the Soviets are
                            pricing oil to Western Europe at about $1 a barrel below posted prices
                            from Persian Gulf sources and about 75 cents below discount prices. The
                            oil situation would be complicated by the additional supply from Sahara
                            and, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> estimated that
                            in a year or so, three-fourths of the French requirements would be
                            supplied by Saharan oil. The Secretary asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> if his company were
                            contemplating a change in its price structure. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RMJ1">Rathbone</persName> said the company had tried to
                            reduce prices a year ago and that they had been faced with what he
                            characterized “almost a revolution” in the Middle Eastern oil countries.
                            Although the companies wanted to reduce prices, he felt it was not
                            possible to do so.</p>

                                    memorandum.</p>
                                <p>The only argument against this action is the adverse impact on
                                    our relations with Latin America, and Bolivia in particular. We
                                    cannot continue to base our good relations on the unrealistic
                                    policy of accumulating stockpiles in excess of any sensible
                                    need. This is to extend the vices of our domestic agricultural
                                    policy abroad, and we will find it simply intolerable, as well
                                    as politically impossible to do so. Indeed, to the extent that
                                    we are considering entering into commodity agreements, we must
                                    make it clear from the outset that we will not accept the task
                                    of simply financing other countries' surplus production ad
                                    infinitum. On the other side, the interest of American
                                    consumers, and the long-run interest of tin producers, both go
                                    in the same direction: for disposal. Further, this represents an
                                    important opportunity to reduce the costs of holding the
                                    stockpile and to make some profit on the sale. The gross profit
                                    on the disposal would run in the neighborhood of 8-10 million
                                    dollars over the average acquisition costs. We would reduce
                                    investment in the stockpile by some $150 million.</p></item>

                            <item>The price of tin has recently reached a new high and as a
                                consequence there has been pressure on the government to dispose of
                                some of our strategic stockpile. The pressure arises from two
                                sources: First, the International Tin Cartel (of which the U.S. is
                                not a member) has sold out its whole buffer stock as required by its
                                statutes when the price reaches $1.10 per pound. It is now $1.16,
                                and it has been as high as $1.20 this year. The second source of
                                pressure is from the consuming industries in the U.S.: the steel
                                industry, and the users of tinplate. In addition to this, there is
                                the pressure of logic: this is an opportunity to diminish our
                                investment in unnecessary stockpiles and to contribute even a small
                                downward push to prices in a period of rising economic
                                activity.</item>

                            <item>The rise in price has been consequent on a gradual decline in
                                production in Bolivia and Indonesia, arising from political
                                disorganization in both countries. This production seems unlikely to
                                be made good in the immediate future, and Malaya, the major
                                producer, is running about at capacity now and cannot readily
                                increase its supply much in the short-run.</item>

                            <item>Present holdings in our strategic stockpile are about 345,000
                                tons, acquired at an average price of about $1.085 per pound. This
                                    <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0793"/>compares with annual
                                world production of something like 145,000 tons currently, and U.S.
                                consumption of 55-60,000 tons of primary tin. The stockpile
                                objective until May of 1960 was a basic figure of 192,000 tons, and
                                a maximum of 198,000 tons. On June 14, 1960, the objectives were
                                reduced to a basic objective of 150,000 tons and a maximum of
                                185,000 tons. Thus, we have an excess of at least 160,000 tons over
                                our estimated emergency requirements. In fact, the emergency
                                requirements are still set too high. They are calculated on the
                                basis of three-year use. Given the likelihood that a war serious
                                enough to cut off the sources of supply would become a general war,
                                that would destroy much more of the capacity for using tin than it
                                would the tin stockpile, and the possibility of a substitution of
                                other products for tin, there would seem to be no doubt of the
                                generosity of the three-year figure.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss> is considering a
                                recommendation that up to 50,000 tons be sold from the stockpile in
                                the next two years. Any such action requires six months' notice to
                                Congress and Congressional approval. The proposed <gloss
                                    target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss> recommendation suggests that the
                                President request Congress for the waiver of the six-months' notice
                                with respect to 10,000 tons, and that the President therefore have
                                the authority to dispose of this much immediately. The best
                                estimates that are available suggest that 10,000 tons could be
                                disposed of with little if any effect on the price, and that
                                therefore the stockpile would realize a significant profit (the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GSA1">GSA</gloss> is now disposing of 4,000
                                tons which were under the control of the <gloss target="#t_GSA1"
                                    >GSA</gloss> in part of the strategic stockpile, and this is
                                expected to go without any effect on the current price of $1.16).
                                The 50,000 tons, if disposed of in the course of a year, might push
                                the price down to $1.05.</item>

                                Bolivia, in particular, is very sensitive about the disposal of tin.
                                Wymberley Coerr, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                                Inter-American Affairs (<gloss target="#t_ARA1">ARA</gloss>), is
                                strongly of the opinion that nothing should be said that would
                                produce any public indication of our intention to sell tin during
                                the course of the Montevideo Conference.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3"
                                    >Reference possibly is to the special meeting of the
                                    Inter-American Economic and Social Council at Punta del Este,
                                    Uruguay, August 5-17, 1961.</note> He believes any discussion of
                                the subject, even a rumor, will be extremely damaging to our
                                position there. On the longer-run, Coerr says that the Bolivians are
                                irrational about disposal <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0794"
                                />of any sort. Past attempts to convince them that the very high
                                price of tin hurts them in the long-run have not been too
                                successful. Further, at the moment, there is a struggle between
                                Communist and anti-Communist factions among the tin miners, and we
                                will do ourselves no good there by any disposal. Coerr agreed that
                                it might be worth thinking about more effective ways of making the
                                Bolivians conscious of their long-run interests in the price of tin;
                                namely, that generally high prices and short supply encourage
                                substitutions away from tin, which once made, may well be
                                permanent.</item>

                            <item>The Congressional situation on the request for waiver is as
                                follows: The matter is within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services
                                Committees, chaired in the Senate by Senator Russell, and in the
                                House by Congressman Vinson. The subcommittees that have cognizance
                                are chaired in the Senate by Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2"
                                    >Symington</persName>, and in the House by Congressman Philbin.
                                So far as is known, none of these is expected to object to the
                                request for the waiver of notice. It is the estimate of Messrs.
                                Wilson and Manatos that, with no objection from the relevant
                                chairmen, the waiver request would go through readily, and that
                                nothing would be lost by waiting until the end of the Montevideo
                                Conference to raise the issue.</item>

                            authority from the Congress at this session, if possible, to release a
                            maximum of 50,000 tons from the strategic stockpile and to waive the six
                            months waiting requirement for 10,000 tons of this amount. I understand
                            that recommendations to this effect have now gone forward from General
                            Services Administration to the Congress.<note n="3" xml:id="d343fn3">For

                            a result, there has already been a break in the price and the upward

                                chairman of the U.S. Delegation, intimated that the United States

                                before further discussions, and he wrote a letter to Roger M.
                                Blough, Chairman of U.S. Steel Corporation, September 6 (filed with
                                the source text), for his views.</note> After their return we will
                            have a period of at least two to three months during which the Commerce
                            Department will have further discussions with the tin consuming
                            industry. The State Department is quite willing to be present at any
                            such meetings and to assist in explaining the various factors involved
                            in becoming full-fledged members of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>In any case, if matters proceed smoothly, we would not be in a position
                            to recommend accession to the Congress, and to have this recommendation
                            acted upon, until the second quarter of 1962.</p>
                        <p>There was also general agreement that the present price of tin is too
                            high and that this presents real threats to the long-run prospects of
                            the tin producing industries throughout the world by stimulating
                            research programs directed toward more economical use of tin and the
                            development of substitute materials. For this and other reasons, we
                            agreed that the U.S. should, at the present time, oppose increases in
                            the price range for tin fixed by the Agreement.</p>

                        <p>The study will take into account not only the welfare of the domestic
                            petroleum industries, but also the need to promote the Nation's economic
                            growth in the face of rapid technological and world changes. The study
                            group has been asked to make recommendations on alternative means of
                            achieving our security objectives and providing a basis for increasing
                            our strength to compete in the free world.</p>
                        <p>Since the study will include a review of the mandatory oil import quota
                            program, it will provide a basis for the consideration of any changes in
                            the existing program that may be necessary. In the meantime, allocations
                            of oil import quotas will continue to be made under the existing
                            proclamation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Present import quota system questioned as a defense
                                measure</hi>. One of the major points raised and around which a
                            number of questions centered was whether the present oil import controls
                            serve the national security interest as effectively and as cheaply as
                            other arrangements would. If the national security interest requires a
                            large quantity of readily available oil in this country, should not oil
                            be stockpiled? One method would be for the Government to buy up some
                            fields and keep them largely out of production until they were needed.
                            Another method would be to import Middle East oil and store it in old
                            oil wells in the United States, particularly in Pennsylvania. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName> said that these
                            measures were possible. He pointed out that only about two-thirds of the
                            oil put into old wells would be recovered because of loss through
                            “wetting.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName> thought that
                            curtailment of U.S. production would be unwise, however, because of the
                            changing fuel picture. He said that 50 years ago lots of people wanted
                            the Government to take over the coal areas and hold them for future use,
                            but that the emergence of oil and gas has shown that such a policy would
                            have been unwise. Likewise, conservation measures for oil might turn out
                            later to have been unnecessary. Mr. Rowen inquired whether Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName> meant by this that we need not
                            worry about oil for defense? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1"
                                >Kelly</persName> replied that he thought that enough U.S. oil would
                            be forthcoming if the domestic industry, particularly because of its
                            exploration activities, could be protected from large imports.</p>
                        <p>The cost of the present import quota system to U.S. oil users was
                            estimated by Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gordon</hi> (<gloss target="#t_CEA1"
                                >CEA</gloss>) at $3 billion per year. (This figure is based on U.S.
                            consumption of 10,000,000 barrels per day at a price $1.25 per barrel
                            above the price of Middle East oil delivered to East Coast refineries,
                            reduced by one-third.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName>
                            replied that this figure assumes that all oil consumed in the United
                            States would be imported from the Middle East at a two-thirds saving of
                            the $1.25 differential. Mr. Gordon questioned this inference stating
                            that he assumed only that the United States domestic price would be
                            governed by the world price. Questions were raised as to whether this
                            cost served effectively to promote the discovery and development of new
                            oil fields in the United States, and whether less costly means could not
                            be found for assuring the availability of adequate oil for defense
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Profits from import controls</hi>. There were several
                            questions about who should be allowed to profit from our import
                            controls. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName> noted that
                            the import restrictions were a response to the difference in production
                            costs in the U.S. and in the Middle East. Though the price difference
                            was about $1.25 per barrel, not all this difference represented profit
                            for domestic U.S. producers. Importers into the U.S. were able, however,
                            to pocket the difference between the U.S. price and the import cost. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName>, in reply to a question
                            as to why we did not tax away this profit on <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773"
                                facs="0799"/>imports, said that this would involve a tariff. He said
                            that a sizable part of the industry would prefer a tariff to quotas, so
                            that they could operate in a freer market, and Interior does not close
                            the door to this approach. He said there would be problems in the use of
                            a tariff, however, because of the different cost conditions between, for
                            example, Venezuela and the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Canadian problem</hi>. The U.S. consumer is
                            subsidizing Canadian producers at the rate of about $250,000 per day,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName> said, since oil from
                            Canada enters the U.S. without any quota restrictions. Canada could meet
                            its entire market by itself, but finds it more economic to export its
                            oil to our Middle West rather than ship it to the Montreal area, and to
                            supply the Montreal area from imports, largely Venezuelan. Others
                            commented that it is in our national security interest to receive
                            Canadian oil. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJM1">Kelly</persName> replied
                            that both countries have the same security interests and that we have
                            protected our East Coast security interest by pipelines while Canada has
                            not, though within five years Canada may start taking care of the
                            Montreal complex by pipeline from its West. In the meantime, Canadian
                            oil competes with U.S. oil in our Midwest.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The broad international problem</hi>. Mr.
                                <persName>Martin</persName> noted that not only does the Free World
                            get two-thirds of its oil from the Middle East now but that 50 years
                            from now it will probably be even more dependent on Middle East
                            supplies. From the security standpoint of our longer-term interest in
                            the broadest sense, we must consider what kind of arrangements we can
                            work out to insure Free World access to Middle East oil.</p>
                        <p>Already we have an irrational situation in the Middle East producing and
                            distributing situation. It is irrational not only economically but
                            politically. The international oil companies within the borders of these
                            countries are in a position to dominate completely the political life of
                            the countries because the companies are the source of the bulk of the
                            Governments' revenues. The companies are earning enormous amounts of
                            money and this is resented. This makes them a likely target for the
                            worst kind of attack on political and economic grounds.</p>
                        <p>On the other end of the spectrum, the companies themselves are faced with
                            all kinds of problems. They are faced with the surpluses of stocks and
                            capacity, with increasing competition of substitutes, with new oil
                            discoveries which jeopardize their traditional markets, with competition
                            from Soviet oil, with having to use their Middle East profits to cover
                            costs of explorations elsewhere that prove sterile, with the constant
                            demand of the Middle East Governments for a larger share of oil revenue,
                            and with no flexibility on prices. These all add up to a serious state
                            of tension.</p>
                        <p>As a result our oil companies are handicapped in other less developed
                            countries where the Soviets use cheap oil and oil exploration to
                            penetrate the countries. Shall Western companies try to compete with the
                                <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0800"/>Soviets in price? (The
                            French assumed that we put import controls on to get high profits for
                            our international oil companies so that they could sell at cut prices in
                            the less developed countries in order to compete with the Soviets.) The
                            companies are in difficulty on exploratory concessions. They come in and
                            spend lots of money and if they don't find oil, they are faced with the
                            charge that they didn't really want to as it would have cut down on
                            their Middle East profits. Then the less developed countries say they
                            will ask the Soviets to come in.</p>
                        <p>The companies are scared of <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> because
                            they don't think the people running it have a sufficient understanding
                            of the economies of oil. They are frightened that the <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> Governments will put international
                            prorationing into effect.</p>
                        <p>Then there is the problem of the European countries in connection with
                            the Soviet oil offensive. The average person in Italy gets his oil
                            cheaper because Italy is importing Soviet oil. Industrialists in Europe
                            can produce at less cost because of Soviet oil. It is hard, under those
                            circumstances, to work up resistance to imports of Soviet oil. Our
                            argument has to be the danger of dependence on Soviet oil. We have made
                            some headway on this, Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> said, as we have
                            agreement (in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>) that the whole
                            question of Soviet dependence has to be watched very carefully and steps
                            taken if necessary. We also think we have now made a little progress on
                            the oil pipe question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Martin</persName> stressed the importance of the
                            Administration address-ing itself to these international oil
                            problems.</p>

                        <p>At his news conference on January 31, 1962, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> made an announcement about the
                            national stockpiling program. He said that the size of the stockpile,
                            $7.7 billion worth of materials, exceeded emergency needs by nearly $3.4
                            billion and that his administration had <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775"
                                facs="0801"/>taken steps to halt any new acquisitions. He deplored
                            the secrecy surrounding the program, which he said was “only an
                            invitation to mismanagement.” He stated that he had discussed the matter
                            with Senator <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Stuart Symington</persName>
                            (D.-Mo.), chairman of the Senate stockpiling subcommittee, who agreed on
                            the need to explore the program completely. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJF2">Kennedy</persName> said that he assured Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWS2">Symington</persName> that the “executive
                            branch will cooperate fully with any investigation.” He noted that he
                            was appointing a commission to review stockpiling policies, programs,
                            and goals. He was “very much aware of the intricate and interrelated
                            problems involved in this area, including the difficulties experienced
                            by certain domestic mineral industries, the impact on world markets, and
                            the heavy reliance of certain countries on producing one or more of
                            these minerals.” In this regard he gave assurance that the United States
                            “will take no action which will disrupt commodity prices.” (<hi

                                further identified.</note> I am designating you to serve as the
                            chairman of a group of department and agency heads to review the
                            principles and policies which should guide our program for the
                            stockpiling of strategic materials. Any stockpiling must obviously be
                            related to our Nation's defense strategy, and must insure that materials
                            necessary to our national defense and security will be available in the
                            event of national emergency.</p>
                        <p>I believe your committee should also give attention to specific goals as
                            well as to basic principles, to the acquisition and maintenance of the
                            materiel, and to the disposal of materials now on hand in excess of
                            goals determined to be appropriate. This program is of vital importance
                            to the Nation both in terms of our security and in terms of the Federal
                            investment in these stockpiled goods. In addition, consideration should
                            be given to the problems of our domestic minerals industry and to the
                            international consequences of our programs of acquisition and
                            disposal.</p>
                        <p>In the past there may have been justification for classifying all or most
                            of the information bearing on this program, but the changes in
                            circumstances from the initiation of the program to the present call for
                            a review of the secret classifications. I expect, therefore, that your
                            committee composed of the heads of those departments and agencies whose
                            responsibilities bear heavily on whether classification is warranted
                            promptly review this question and that you will take the steps necessary
                            to declassify as much information as possible consistent with national
                            security. I am hopeful that your review will be completed by an early
                            date and, in any event, no later than March 19.</p>

                                Regarding inquiries about this development, the Department of State
                                instructed Embassies to point out to their respective governments
                                that Latin American countries other than Cuba supplied only a small
                                part of the U.S. market and that the total premium was only $12.8
                                million. Embassies could also state that the administration was
                                considering asking Congress to make funds collected on sugar from
                                Latin America available for Latin American economic development.

                                xml:id="pg_778" facs="0804"/>the great importance to the Peruvian
                            economy and to the Peruvian Government's development programs of
                            revenues resulting from the exportation of sugar. You therefore request
                            that any decision reached by the United States take into account the
                            serious repercussions for Peru that would result from any reduction in
                            the price of imported sugar.</p>
                        <p>I had delayed until now answering your letter in the expectation that the
                            thinking of the Executive Branch on this subject would have reached a
                            point where it might have been possible to explain more precisely the
                            prospective recommendations to be made by the Administration to the
                            Congress. The matter continues to be under active study within the
                            Executive Branch, however, and the proposals of which your Ambassador
                            has informed you thus do not yet represent the Administration's
                            position. I have, meanwhile, asked the Department of State to keep your
                            Ambassador in Washington informed of principal developments, and,
                            consequently, the Under Secretary of State, Mr. <persName

                        <p>I am confident that Your Excellency will appreciate the various
                            considerations my Government must weigh in conducting this study and
                            reaching a final position. Please be assured that we, for our part, are
                            fully aware of the importance of this problem to Peru and to other
                            friendly countries and that we sincerely trust the solution we achieve
                            will in the long run prove beneficial. I should also emphasize, of
                            course, that the final decision on United States sugar policies rests
                            with the United States Congress.</p>
                        <p>I very much appreciate your remark about the closely linked interests of
                            our two countries, and should like to add that we in this country value
                            most highly this close relationship with Peru.</p>

                            guide our national stockpile of strategic materials and its relationship
                            to our national defense and security. The Committee has examined
                            specifically the policies governing the program, the acquisition and
                            maintenance of the inventories in the stockpile, the disposal of excess
                            materials, and the classification of information bearing on this
                            program. No examination could be made on the specific goals or
                            objectives because of limited time and lack of new requirements
                            information. This examination will be expedited in the coming
                            months.</p>
                        <p>On March 2, 1962, this Committee recommended to you that information
                            pertaining to the current objectives and inventories of the Strategic
                            and Critical Materials Stockpile should be declassified.<note n="2"

                        <p>The other recommendations of the Committee are presented herewith for
                            your approval. A substantial number of these recommendations can be put
                            into effect by administrative actions. New legislation will be necessary
                            to implement the others.</p>
                        <p>The United States Government, as of December 31, 1961, held raw materials
                            inventories with a market value of $7,723 million. Within this total,
                            the inventory valuations are: National Stockpile, $5,729 million;
                            Defense Production Act, $921 million; Commodity Credit Corporation
                            Barter and Supplemental Stockpiles, $1,070 million; and Federal
                            Facilities Corporation, $3 million. Current maximum objectives in the
                            National Stockpile are valued at $4,332 million, and excess materials at
                            $3,391 million. Net storage, rotation and disposal, and administrative
                            expenses approximate $21-$22 million annually.</p>

                        <p>In its examination of the scope of stockpile objectives, the Committee
                            has considered the following points:</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Current policy provides that the strategic stockpile objectives
                                shall be adequate to cover material deficits for limited or general
                                nuclear war (including reconstruction), whichever is greater. The
                                planning assumptions now used by the Office of Emergency Planning
                                and other Government departments and agencies engaged in defense
                                mobilization activities are consonant with this policy. However, no
                                definitive scope has been established for general nuclear war, nor
                                has the extent of the reconstruction period been clearly
                                defined.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>No material is now included in the stockpile objectives for
                                allocation to our allies other than normal wartime exports.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>At present there is no reserve in strategic and critical materials
                                stockpile objectives to guard against long term materials deficits
                                in the United States projected a decade or more. The time and
                                amounts of deficits would be almost impossible to determine.
                                Discovery of new sources of supply, availability of substitute
                                materials, and many other things could eliminate the need for
                                inventories in the stockpile. It is believed that the initiative and
                                ingenuity of a healthy and dynamic free economy will help make the
                                necessary adjustments in supply and demand in the long run.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Defense Mobilization Order V-7 provides that stockpile objectives
                                shall consist of (1) a “basic objective” which assumes reliance on
                                sources of supply factored to reflect estimated supply risks, and
                                (2) a “maximum objective” which includes an additional allowance to
                                take into account the complete discounting of sources of supply
                                beyond North America and comparably accessible areas. Since 1958 new
                                cash procurement for the stockpile has been limited to minimum
                                objectives. Maximum objectives were to be attained by barter and
                                other methods. With the exception of five materials, inventories on
                                hand now exceed or closely approximate the maximum objectives of all
                                items in the stockpile. Current procurement is limited to three of
                                these materials because of uncertainty of the future requirements
                                for the other two. Establishment of a single objective would
                                simplify the determination of objectives and <pb n="781"
                                    xml:id="pg_781" facs="0807"/>would eliminate considerable paper
                                work in the management functions of the stockpile.</item>

                            survival probability in nuclear war of production and consumption plants
                            in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Committee believes that the supply information received by the Office
                            of Emergency Planning is adequate, and its system of discounting is
                            sound.</p>

                        <p>The current stockpile objectives are limited to meeting the estimated
                            shortages of materials for a three-year emergency. This planning period
                            cannot be determined with mathematical accuracy. At best, it is an
                            expert judgment based on considerations of a multitude of

                            matter will receive the further attention of the Committee.</p>
                        <p>The planning period for nuclear war is indeterminate because of lack of
                            supply-requirements estimates and criteria defining the extent of
                            coverage. The studies suggested under Scope of Objectives should provide
                            a sound basis for these studies.</p>
                        <p>Present regulations require that the supply-requirements balance for any

                            significant bearing on the United States wartime readiness position. All
                            stockpile objectives are examined at least once a year to ascertain the
                            need for a full-scale review. However, these examinations have shown no
                            significant changes in the past three or four years, due principally to
                            relative stability of military requirements in this period.</p>

                            MATERIALS</p>
                        <p>Effective management of the stockpile of the Office of Emergency Planning
                            and the General Services Administration requires considerable
                            flexibility in acquisition and disposal of materials. Sufficient
                            flexibility has been available in the acquisition of materials, but this
                            phase of stockpiling is largely completed. Disposal activity, however,
                            is controlled by legislation and executive policies.</p>
                        <p>One of the executive controls applicable to disposals is the provision
                            written into Defense Mobilization Order V-7 in 1959 which states in part
                            that “except when (surplus) materials are channeled to other agencies
                            for their direct use, (the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning)
                            must obtain the approval of the Departments of the Interior, Commerce,
                            State, Agriculture, and Defense, and other Governmental agencies con-
                            cerned. . . .”</p>
                        <p>Legislation has been drafted by the Office of Emergency Planning and
                            General Services Administration, but not yet cleared by the Executive
                                <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0809"/>Branch, which would modify
                            considerably the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act of
                            1946. The proposed legislation would provide for changes in stockpile
                            management by permitting the General Services Administration to
                            consolidate materials inventories acquired under the provisions of the
                            Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, the Defense
                            Production Act, and transferred to the Supplemental Stockpile from
                            barter or other programs into two inventories: (a) the national
                            stockpile, composed of materials required to meet objectives, and (b)
                            the materials reserve inventory, composed of all other materials.</p>
                        <p>The proposed legislation would authorize transfer, without cost or
                            reimbursement, of: (a) materials not required for objectives from the
                            national stockpile to the materials reserve inventory, (b) materials
                            required for objectives from the materials reserve inventory to the
                            national stockpile, and (c) exchange of materials to improve the quality
                            or change the location of materials in the national stockpile.</p>
                        <p>The legislation would allow equivalent materials in the two inventories
                            to be commingled, and also would permit materials in the materials
                            reserve inventory to be used for payment for conversion costs and
                            rotation costs (to prevent deterioration or to change the location) for
                            similar materials.</p>
                        <p>The consolidation of inventories would permit more economical and
                            effective use of storage space, since like materials could be
                            commingled, and it would avoid the necessity for physical segregation
                            and identification in storage. It would provide for more economical
                            dispersal of materials charged against the strategic and critical
                            materials stockpile by permitting an exchange for materials in other
                            inventories more safely located. It would further considerably simplify
                            property accounting and reporting.</p>
                        <p>The proposal would provide greater flexibility for disposal of excess
                            stockpile materials by (a) reducing the waiting period from six months
                            to sixty days, (b) eliminating the requirements for the express approval
                            of the Congress, and (c) making the waiting period applicable only if
                            the quantity to be sold during the first or last six months of the
                            calendar year exceeds three percent of the estimated annual United
                            States consumption of the material.</p>
                        <p>The proposal would continue the present provisions that, in disposing of
                            materials, due regard be given to the protection of the United States
                            against avoidable loss and the protection of producers, processors, and
                            consumers against avoidable disruption of their usual markets.</p>
                        <p>A provision would be added to provide that due regard be given to the
                            foreign relations of the United States in the disposal of materials, to
                            the effect of disposals on employment or unemployment in the United
                            States, and to provide for consultation with departments and agencies

                        <p>The policy of upgrading raw materials in the stockpile to higher use
                            forms is an integral part of the overall stockpiling policy. It
                            represents a <pb n="785" xml:id="pg_785" facs="0811"/>stockpiling of
                            time, labor, power and transportation, in addition to materials.
                            Upgrading is not undertaken when the processing cost exceeds the amount
                            for which the upgraded product can be obtained in the open market (DMO
                            V-7).</p>
                        <p>An upgrading program has been under way for some time, and a majority of
                            the materials for which upgrading could be undertaken have been upgraded
                            or are under contract. In many instances upgrading has resulted in an
                            increased value of the stockpile.</p>
                        <p>Proposals have been made to upgrade some of the inventories to finished
                            products such as aluminum sheets and building materials, steel sheets,
                            I-beams and rails. These finished products would be stockpiled for
                            survival and continuity of industry in event of nuclear attack on this
                            country. However, considerable study is necessary before recommendations
                            can be made on this type of stockpiling.</p>

                            except on one point.</p>
                        <p>Under existing procedures the Director of the Office of Emergency
                            Planning (formerly <gloss target="#t_OCDM1">OCDM</gloss>) is required to
                            obtain the approval of the Department of State, among other agencies,
                            before he authorizes the disposal of excess stockpile materials. The
                            majority of the Committee has recommended that the Director be permitted
                            to act after consultation with the State Department and other agencies;
                            it has recommended the elimination of the requirement that the State
                            Department approve stockpile reductions.</p>
                        <p>I fully recognize the need for disposing of excess stockpile materials as
                            rapidly as possible. However, it is essential that this be done without
                            disrupting world commodity markets, which are in many cases extremely
                            sensitive to any move on our part to reduce stockpiles.</p>
                        <p>A fall in commodity prices can, of course, be disastrous to less
                            developed countries dependent for their foreign exchange earnings on one
                            or two commodities. The reactions with regard to recent programs for the
                            disposal of rubber and tin have clearly shown that the business of
                            reducing stockpiles can have serious foreign policy repercussions. I
                            therefore feel that we should retain the requirement that the approval
                            of the State Department be obtained prior to the disposal of surpluses.
                            In view of the extreme sensitivity of many of these markets the mere act
                            of eliminating this widely known requirement would be likely to create
                            dismay and confusion.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I am sympathetic with the desirability of reducing the
                            delay which has sometimes occurred in obtaining the necessary approval
                            for disposal plans. The regulations might provide an appropriate <pb
                                n="788" xml:id="pg_788" facs="0814"/>time limit. For our part we
                            would be willing to agree with the other agencies that if we do not
                            object to a proposed disposal plan within thirty days of its receipt our
                            approval could be assumed.<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">A memorandum from

                            recommended the establishment of a long-term affirmative disposal
                            program for stockpile materials significantly in excess of objectives.
                            At the same time it proposed a change in Defense Mobilization Order V-7
                            which would require consultation with instead of approval by the
                            agencies concerned in regard to disposal plans. In effect, this would
                            eliminate the right of individual agencies to veto any disposal program
                            proposed by the Office of Emergency Planning and the General Services
                            Administration. The Department of Interior and the Department of State
                            strongly dissented from this proposed change.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our participation in the preparation of Executive
                            Stockpile Committee report we expressed strong views about the need for
                            a continuing, effective disposal program and pointed out how the
                            exercise of individual veto powers of the several agencies based on
                            their special interests could interfere substantially with an overall
                            sales program. <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0815"/>Further, we
                            believed that final responsibility for determining the national interest

                            March. (Tab D) There are two kinds of major recommendations—for further

                            <item>The further studies recommended include re-examination of
                                stockpile objectives and requirements, and also of the program of
                                acquisitions through barter now undertaken in conjunction with the
                                Department of Agriculture.</item>

                            <item>The major action recommendation is that the disposal process be
                                simplified and speeded up by amendment of both defense mobilization
                                orders and legislation. The purpose of these changes would be to
                                reduce the period of notice to Congress from six months to sixty
                                days, to eliminate it entirely for sales below certain levels, and
                                to eliminate the need for express approval by Congress. These
                                changes would be accomplished by legislation. The proposed amendment
                                of the defense mobilization order would eliminate the requirement
                                that <gloss target="#t_OEP1">OEP</gloss> secure the approval of the
                                Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Labor and Agriculture for
                                proposed disposals, and substitute merely the requirement that it
                                consult these and other interested agencies. State and Interior both
                                dissent from this last proposal and each insists that it retain its
                                power of approval or disapproval. Commerce, on the other hand,
                                strongly urges the proposal and further urges that there be long-run
                                disposal programs which involve a minimum annual sale of heavy
                                surplus material with additional sale to be conditioned on
                                circumstances. Letters to you from Under Secretary <persName

                                international companies and the Government of Iran, which resolved

                            regarded this as favorable factor ensuring moderate approach. He pointed
                            out this connection that negotiations need not be completed within
                            specified time and that they would be conducted in unhurried and
                            friendly spirit. Prime Minister also mentioned that Page<note n="3"

                        <p>Essential points of resolutions call for (1) initiation “forthwith” of

                            prior to August 1960; (2) development of formula whereunder oil royalty
                            payments shall be fixed at “uniform rate” and shall not be treated as
                            credit against income tax liability; (3) elimination by member countries
                            of any contribution to the marketing expenses of the companies

                        <p>Following general remarks on the world oil situation, in particular
                            worldwide surplus productive capacity, the conversation was steered to
                            the recent <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> resolutions.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d355fn1">See <ref target="#d354fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    354</ref>.</note> At Mr. Johnson's request the visitors gave
                            what they asked be clearly understood as preliminary impressions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Stinebower said two things occurred to him: first, it was
                            understandable that the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> member
                            countries should be seriously preoccupied with their own “take” and
                            their related concern with the price question; second, that the
                            companies obviously have no objection to higher prices but this is
                            unrealistic in view of the world oil surplus.</p>
                        <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0821"/>
                        <p>Mr. Pearcy said it was obvious that the August 1960 reduction in posted
                            prices, in which his company took the lead, was the critical action
                            leading to <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss>. Looking back, it was a
                            questionable step politically, but seemed fully warranted at the time if
                            posted prices were to bear any close relationship to the market. He
                            added that the price cut was only a step in the direction of reality and
                            reflected only a part of the discounts then prevailing. He then alluded
                            to the inequities resulting from the present freeze in posted prices.
                            Kuwait, with low gravity (low value) crude enjoys a better relative
                            price as compared with Saudi Arabian higher gravity (higher value) crude
                            which finds itself at a price disadvantage. On the restoration of prices
                            to the pre-August 1960 level (the cut averages 8# per barrel throughout
                            the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> countries), he said this was
                            patently impossible from a commercial viewpoint; also the companies
                            cannot talk price with <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> because it
                            is: 1) bad business, and 2) prohibited by anti-trust restraints. He
                            cited the dissatisfaction of Western European governments that most of
                            the oil profit is taken in the producing countries and leaves a narrow
                            margin of profit (in some cases no margin) as a tax base for European
                            refining and marketing operations.</p>
                        <p>Between them, Messrs. Stinebower and Pearcy made the point that the
                                <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> resolutions on royalty are so
                            vague that they preclude any judgment now. Perhaps preliminary talks
                            between <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> and company spokesmen will
                            better define their real objectives. Mr. Pearcy thought the resolution
                            on elimination of marketing expenses presents “no great problem”.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. Johnson's question as to whether <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> “had teeth in it”, Mr. Pearcy replied
                            that it will certainly have to be taken seriously and speaking for
                            himself (not for his directors) he felt some accommodation could be
                            reached but it would take a lot of time, a lot of talking and a great
                            deal of patience on the part of the companies and the <gloss
                                target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> negotiators. Hopefully, he said,
                            these talks might lead to a durable, mutually tolerable regime. He added
                            that we should not overlook the fact that Venezuela would stand to gain
                            a great deal in relative competitiveness should either of the major
                            resolutions be implemented. He suggested that this may be clearer to the
                            Venezuelans than to the Persian Gulf countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Johnson asked if the visitors thought we (the U.S. Government) should
                            have plans to counter the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> thrust.
                            Mr. Stinebower said he did not personally feel that the Middle East
                            agreements were so sacrosanct that the companies should not be willing
                            to discuss them. He revised the history of the Iranian nationalization
                            and the extent of U.S. Government involvement which had led to a
                            solution. He felt that any U.S. Government initiative, if it should in
                            time prove necessary, would have to first await the developments
                            resulting from company-<gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> talks. (As
                            a historical footnote he referred to the December 1958 increase <pb

                            adding that while this step was unassailable legally and technically, it
                            was now evident that this made Venezuelan oil less competitive and made
                            Venezuela much less attractive for large scale investment. He hoped this

                            members.) Mr. Pearcy, in speculating on what the companies might settle
                            for, said it was his own view that the companies in general would like
                            to reach a “peaceful plateau” if this were a durable and financially
                            tolerable solution. The present system is so bound up in rigidities that
                            something has to give in some direction. In response to Mr. Johnson's
                            question as to the negotiating strength of the companies, Mr. Stinebower
                            replied that it was great. The greatest danger, to the companies and to
                            the Western world, in his mind was a suicidal wave of expropriation to
                            which there is no rational counterforce.</p>
                        <p>On the question of an international oil agreement, Mr. Nichols said this
                            presented a dilemma. On the one hand, it is clear that we lack an
                            overall coordinating mechanism; but on the other hand, could this be
                            done by governments in a workable and generally beneficial form. He was
                            inclined to think it probably could not. Mr. Stinebower said that the
                            history of international commodity agreements was pretty sad; even those
                            that had worked, had done so very lamely. Mr. Johnson added that where
                            they had worked one important producer had had to be willing to accept a
                            residual market position.</p>
                        <p>The conversation turned to U.S. oil imports. Mr. Kannenberg mentioned
                            that the issue of more or less imports (or perhaps the same level) was
                            likely to be up for decision soon. Mr. Pearcy said Jersey of course
                            thought residual fuel oil should be decontrolled. The crude oil question
                            was more difficult because of Humble's leading position in the domestic
                            market, but that Jersey would not publicly support any more restrictive
                            program than now exists.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Johnson said the talks had been most
                            helpful to him and he hoped we could continue them. He said we should
                            follow the <gloss target="#t_OPEC1">OPEC</gloss> developments with much
                            care. Mr. Stinebower agreed and said he (or his associates who are
                            following this very closely) were available on a moment's notice and
                            would keep the Department informed.</p>

                            however, declined to express satisfaction with a United States proposal
                            that a maximum of 200 tons weekly be disposed of for an initial six
                            months period (enclosure 4). An exchange of telegrams (enclosures 5 and
                            6) has resulted in acceptance by Malaya of a disposal program of 200
                            tons weekly for the remainder of 1962. Malaya earlier had made vigorous
                            repeated representations seeking a limit of 100 tons and the accept-ance
                            of the higher figure can be viewed as a real achievement in gaining
                            opportunity to start with a test of the market's absorptive capacity in
                            some reasonable relationship to the presently estimated shortfall.</p>
                        <p>In both consultations an offer was made, with approval of the

                            States would seek concurrence of interested U.S. agencies in limiting
                            disposals of 200 tons weekly and it does not seem realistic to try to
                            hold to the initially contemplated figure of 250 tons at this stage when
                            Malaya has acquiesced in the ad referendum offer of 200, and may even
                            try to induce a sympathetic reaction among other producers, aside from
                            Bolivia.</p>

                            see if any change could be made to meet producer interests, the
                            Ambassador was assured that he would have 24 hours notice of the text of

                            <p>The United States Government, having had consultations with the

                                Governments of the major tin producing countries—Malaya, Bolivia,
                                Indonesia, Thailand, Nigeria, and the Republic of the Congo,
                                Leopoldville—on the proposed disposal of surplus tin during the

                            <p>Desiring to take into account the problem of the producing countries,
                                and to conform as nearly as feasible to the suggestions advanced by
                                their Governments, the United States Government has decided to
                                reduce the quantity of tin to be disposed of to a maximum of 200
                                tons per week. Of this, an average of approximately 30 tons per week
                                is expected to be used in the foreign aid programs, and
                                approximately 10 tons per week for direct use by United States
                                Government agencies. The quantity actually sold in commercial

                            <p>The United States Government is interested in protecting the

                                and therefore assumes the responsibility to observe the market
                                situation closely, and to reduce or suspend sales below the maximum
                                offering if necessary to avoid a significant adverse impact on the
                                market. No bids will be <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0825"

                        <p>I am pleased to submit a Report based upon a comprehensive study of
                            petroleum requirements and supplies in relation to national security
                            objectives, undertaken in accordance with your directive issued December

                        <p>The Conclusions and Recommendations of the attached Report are the result
                            of extensive study by the Committee and its Task Force group and the
                            report has been signed on behalf of all participating departments.</p>
                        <p>At the request of the Department of Interior, I have been asked to report
                            to you their opinion that the conclusions relating to costs and benefits
                            are potentially misleading. Interior contends that “while estimates
                            purportedly covering costs to the economy are included in the report,
                            the counter-balancing benefits which flow from the maintenance of the
                            petroleum industry in its present state of health were not reduced to
                            comparable terms.” The Interior member also states “that existing
                            legislation and delegations vest the Director of the Office of Emergency
                            Planning with adequate authority to deal with the security aspects of
                            the petroleum problem and that, in consequence, the recommendation in
                            the <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0826"/>report dealing with
                            coordination of interagency activities is unnecessary and could lead to
                            future difficulty in assessing responsibility for development and

                            <item>Attached is the report of the Executive Stockpile Committee on the
                                Barter Program. The nine recommendations, pages 4 through 6, go to
                                the objective of limiting the use of barter to those occasions where
                                surplus agricultural commodities can be usefully exchanged for items
                                that are clearly needed. Recommendation 6 provides for a list of
                                exceptions to the general rule that barter should not be used to
                                acquire strategic and critical materials in excess of national
                                stockpile objectives.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>These exceptions are appropriate and, aside from two,
                                well-defined. These two (6 b. and 6 d.) raise some problems. Six d.
                                provides for using barter instead of cash purchases when this can be
                                done in such a way as to save dollar payments abroad. This is
                                clearly a desirable objective. The recommendation would be improved,
                                however, if it provided for consultation with the Treasury
                                Department so that Treasury's judgment as to whether in fact there
                                was a real saving in our balance of payments would be
                                available.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Recommendation 6 b. raises more difficult questions. This provides
                                for barter to acquire raw materials for processing in the U.S. which
                                would help in maintaining the materials processing mobilization base
                                and relieve areas of unemployment. Both these goals are extremely
                                broad, and the recommendation provides no procedure for determining
                                whether they will be achieved in any particular instance. We have
                                alternative and usually more efficient methods for assisting areas
                                of substantial unemployment. There is no defined standard for the
                                materials processing mobilization base and in the absence of a
                                defined standard, this paragraph could be used to justify almost any
                                barter transaction.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>The objections to these two provisions were shared by the Bureau
                                of the Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers. Ed McDermott,
                                the Director of Office of Emergency Planning, would be perfectly
                                agreeable to your making the suggested change in Recommendation 6 d.
                                and reserving approval on 6 b. until further study. It is his
                                judgment that such a directive would be sufficient to lead to the
                                withdrawal of 6 b. by the other members of the Committee.
                                Accordingly, I suggest that you send the attached memorandum to Mr.
                                McDermott and the other members of the Executive Stockpile

                            <p>The diverse opinions of the different Federal agencies about the

                                initiated early in May, the Department of Agriculture had almost
                                completed proposals for a revised barter program which had been
                                developed following consultations with a non-governmental task force
                                and with other Federal agencies. Recommendation No. 9 of the

                                    <p>“The Basic Principles and Rules of Application of the
                                        proposed Revised Barter Program (Tab A) prepared by the
                                        Department of Agriculture should be revised to reflect the
                                        foregoing recommendations, and should be adopted as thus
                                        revised.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>I believe it is important that the recommended revision be made and
                                adopted by the Department of Agriculture as soon as possible, and
                                without further detailed or prolonged consultations that may be
                                merely a repetition of the process that has just been completed by
                                the Executive Stockpile Committee.</p>

                                departments, there are individual views which I wish to call to your
                                attention:</p>
                            <p>Although the Department of the Treasury is not a member of the
                                Executive Stockpile Committee and is not a signatory to this Report,
                                its representatives participated fully in the staff and Committee
                                discussions which resulted in the Report. The Department
                                particularly feels that careful consideration must be given to the
                                general effects of barter transactions on the balance-of-payments
                                position of the United States and that, in this connection,
                                appropriate attention should be given to the extent to which barter
                                transactions might displace cash sales or are in <pb n="804"
                                    xml:id="pg_804" facs="0830"/>addition to such cash sales, and to
                                their competitive relation to other methods of procuring goods and
                                services. The Department of Defense and other members share this
                                view.</p>
                            <p>The Department of Commerce limits its approval to the Recommendations
                                of the attached Report and specifically opposes any barter
                                transaction carried out while a disposal program involving the same
                                materials is in operation, as well as any multilateral barter
                                transaction.</p>
                            <p>The Committee is continuing its study of other phases of the
                                stockpile problem.</p>

                                    The Secretary of Agriculture should consult with the Secretary
                                    of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, respectively,
                                    concerning the general impact which the barter program has on

                                    Federal agencies the opportunities for the enlargement of the
                                    use of barter in support of currently budgeted programs or
                                    programs which have procurement authority extending over a

                                    International Development should cooperate with the Department
                                    of Agriculture by effecting offshore procurement, using
                                    qualified barter arrangements to the greatest practicable extent
                                    when dollars would otherwise be spent abroad for the items being
                                    procured. In carrying out such procurement, the Department of
                                    Agriculture should absorb any increased cost incurred by the

                                    to offset U.S. military expenditures in that country, except

                                examining how important maintaining the materials processing

                        <p>The U.N. Coffee Conference, consisting of representatives of 56 countries
                            (including the United States), met in New York July-September 1962, and
                            formulated the Coffee Agreement, 1962 (14 UST 1911). The objective of
                            the agreement was to assure that coffee prices in general did not
                            decline below the 1962 level. The agreement relied on an export quota
                            system negotiated among coffee-exporting countries to achieve price
                            stability with quarterly adjustments according to changes in consumption
                            estimates. <persName corresp="#p_BWM2">W. Michael Blumenthal</persName>
                            signed for the United States. The agreement entered into force on
                            December 27, 1963.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State instructed Embassies in coffee-exporting
                            countries to emphasize that the U.S. delegation “did not intercede in
                            quota negotiations for any country.” Since U.S. Department of
                            Agriculture figures were used as a basis for negotiation, the Department
                            of State wanted to forestall the possibility that some countries might
                            blame the <pb n="808" xml:id="pg_808" facs="0834"/>United States for
                            their failure to secure an adequate quota on grounds of an incorrect
                            estimate. The agreement principally obliged coffee-importing countries
                            like the United States to restrict imports from nonparticipants to the
                            average quantity imported during the 3-year base period to prevent
                            nonparticipants from sharing increases in consumption. Voting in the
                            Council, situated in London, was based on quantity of exports and
                            imports, giving the United States and Brazil a virtual veto on major
                            Council decisions. (Circular telegram 342 to 29 Embassies and USUN,

                                    of petroleum. It has become apparent that elements of state

                            be used as fuel, will bear the same relationship to domestic production
                            of liquid hydrocarbons as that which existed in 1961. This maximum level
                            will include overland exempt imports.</p>

                            appropriate, the more rapid phasing out of historical allocations
                            granted on the basis of imports now governed by the overland

                        <p>As of September 30, 1962, the market value of Government inventories of
                            strategic and critical materials in excess of present maximum objectives
                            was $3,336,303,000.</p>
                        <p>Of this total, $3,100,702,000 represented inventories of
                            specification-grade materials. The balance, $235,601,000, represented
                            materials which do not meet specifications or for which there are no
                            stockpile objectives.</p>

                        <p>About seventy-nine per cent of the excess of specification-grade
                            materials, i.e., $2,438,000,000, is invested in inventories of only
                            twelve materials. The remaining twenty-one per cent of such excess,
                            i.e., $662,702,000, is contained in inventories of forty-nine
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>Net recurring storage costs applicable to surplus inventories amount to
                            approximately $4 million annually.</p>

                            meet contingencies short of war or national emergency arising because of
                            the unanticipated consequences of economic or political activities in
                            foreign countries which might result in a cut-off of critical supplies
                            essential to day-to-day operations of the economy. Deferral of disposals
                            on this basis should be confined to those cases where the United States
                            is dependent for the bulk of its requirements on a limited number of
                            foreign countries, where adequate substitute materials are unavailable,
                            and where a cut-off of supplies would cause a serious disruption in a
                            broad sector of commercial or industrial activity.</p>

                            however, to the use of set-asides and the provision of terms and
                            conditions which can be met by small businesses with regard to
                            packaging, quantities, payments, and delivery. Full use should be made
