                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Under the
                    direction of the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series, the staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory
                    charter for the preparation of the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a
                    new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22
                        <gloss target="#t_USC1">USC</gloss> 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the series will be historically objective and accurate; records should
                    not be altered or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a
                    deletion has been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of
                    major importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded, a requirement that the Office of the
                    Historian is striving to meet. The editors are convinced that this volume meets
                    all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and editing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important foreign policy
                    issues and major decisions of the administrations of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Richard M. Nixon</persName> and Gerald R. Ford, 1969–1972. When all volumes
                    are published, the sub-series will contain 41 print volumes and 16
                    electronic-only volumes. These 57 volumes will document all aspects of foreign
                    policy during <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0005"/>the 8-year period. More
                    volumes are allocated to the first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration than the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-Ford
                    administration, with the issue that is covered determining the beginning and
                    ending dates of the volume. For example, the volume on Chile culminates with the
                    overthrow of President Salvador Allende in September 1973, and the first volume
                    on energy covers 1969–1974, ending with the post-oil embargo Washington Energy
                    Conference. Two volumes cover the 1969–1976 period, South Africa and European
                    Security. This volume, <ref target="frus1969-76v12">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, Volume XII</ref>,
                    documents U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union during the first 22 months of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration. This is a short
                    time span, but a period of burgeoning conflicts and major initiatives. The
                    volume culminates with the resolution of the crisis over the Soviet construction
                    of a nuclear submarine base at Cienfuegos in Cuba.</p>

                <p>The scope of this volume is different from previous volumes on the Soviet Union
                    and reflects a reexamination of how the Office of the Historian should present
                    documentation on U.S. relations with its major opponent in the Cold War, the
                    Soviet Union. In the past, volumes on the Soviet Union primarily documented
                    U.S.-Soviet bilateral relations, and much of the documentation on U.S.-Soviet
                    global confrontation and/or cooperation was found in other <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> volumes. On the advice of the Advisory Committee on
                    Historical Diplomatic Documentation, the Office of the Historian revised its
                    approach. In <ref target="frus1961-63v05">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1961–1963, Vol. V</ref>, Soviet
                    Union, the editors made a concerted effort to use editorial notes to highlight
                    key instances of U.S.-Soviet conflict or collaboration in other volumes in the
                    subseries. The publication of an additional volume, <ref target="frus1961-63v06"
                        >VI</ref>, on <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>-Khrushchev
                    exchanges also sought to broaden the coverage of U.S.-Soviet relations. This
                    volume continues the trend and is the first of three volumes documenting the
                    first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's global
                    confrontation, competition, and cooperation with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration presented a
                    pressing argument to look at the U.S.-Soviet relationship in its broadest,
                    global context. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> created a
                    secret, private channel of dialogue and negotiation between the President's
                    Assistant for National Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A.
                        Kissinger</persName>, and the Soviet Ambassador in Washington, <persName
                        corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoly F. Dobrynin</persName>. The documentary record of
                    the establishment and early use of that channel is presented in its entirety in
                    this volume. In his relations with Moscow, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> insisted on linkage of other issues with improvements in
                    U.S.-Soviet relations. This volume highlights U.S.-Soviet interaction in the
                    negotiations for a Middle East settlement, the role that the United States
                    expected the Soviet Union to play in <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0006"/>ending
                    the Vietnam war, challenges to the U.S.-Soviet relationship in light of the
                    Sino-Soviet border dispute, and the concern over Soviet strategic nuclear
                    developments, such as the SS–9, in beginning Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.
                    This expanded interaction between the two superpowers required a redesign of <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> coverage of the Soviet Union. The
                    number of documents printed and the scope of their content were greatly
                    expanded. There are five volumes for the Soviet Union within the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-Ford subseries, 1969–1976, three of which
                    document the crucial first <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    administration. These volumes document U.S.-Soviet relations worldwide and more
                    accurately reflect the global nature of the Cold War.</p>
                <p>These changes do not mean that documentation on U.S.-Soviet competition and
                    cooperation is not in other <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes of
                    the subseries. The Soviet Union volumes are the core documentary account of
                    U.S.-Soviet conflict and cooperation during this period of the Cold War. They
                    are the volumes to consult first, but with the exception of providing a complete
                    documentary record of the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                    backchannel, this volume in many ways serves as a guidepost to fuller coverage
                    of topics where U.S.-Soviet interests intersect. In the end, of course, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series must be viewed and used as an
                    integrated publication of many volumes. The Soviet Union volumes—with their
                    extensive use of extracts and editorial notes highlighting and summarizing
                    relevant related material in other volumes in the subseries that impact on
                    U.S-Soviet relations—emphasize the core issues of the Cold War, as seen through
                    the prism of U.S.-Soviet global relations. This volume on the Soviet Union
                    provides a summary account of U.S.-Soviet worldwide confrontation, competition,
                    and cooperation during the 22 months it covers, and directs the reader to <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes in which other aspects of
                    U.S.-Soviet relations are covered, such as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks,
                    U.S.-Soviet negotiations for a Middle East peace settlement, U.S.-Soviet
                    discussions on a negotiated settlement in Southeast Asia, U.S-Soviet
                    negotiations over Germany and Berlin, U.S. monitoring of the Sino-Soviet border
                    dispute, and U.S.-Soviet interaction in South Asia. The preponderance of
                    memoranda generated by <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>
                    and his <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff also reflects the central role
                    that the President's Assistant for National Security Affairs played in the
                    formulation of policy toward the Soviet Union.</p>

                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the date and time of the
                    conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted. Documents chosen
                    for printing are authoritative or signed copies, unless otherwise noted.</p>

                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor. The documents are reproduced as exactly as
                    possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are described in the
                    footnotes. The editors have supplied a heading for each document included in the
                    volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained as found in the
                    original text, except that obvious typographical errors are silently corrected.
                    Other mistakes and omissions in the documents are corrected by bracketed
                    insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Words
                    or phrases underlined in the source text are printed in italics. Abbreviations
                    and contractions are preserved as found in the original text, and a list of
                    abbreviations is included in the front matter of each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets and ellipses that appear in the original text are so identified in
                    footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides

                <p>Under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act
                    (PRMPA) of 1974 (44 <gloss target="#t_USC1">USC</gloss> 2111 note), the National

                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential historical materials. The
                    requirements of the PRMPA and implementing regulations govern access to the

                    materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations require NARA to
                    review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the protection of the
                    privacy rights of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White
                    House officials, since these officials were not given the opportunity to
                    separate their personal materials from public papers. Thus, the PRMPA and
                    implementing public access regulations require NARA formally to notify the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and former <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House staff members that the agency

                    historical materials in which they were a participant or are mentioned. Further,
                    the PRMPA and implementing regulations require NARA to segregate and return to
                    the creator of files private and personal materials. All <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified
                    National Security Information and other applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security, as embodied in
                    law and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments. The
                    declassification review <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0009"/>of this
                    volume, which began in 2001 and was completed in 2003, resulted in the decision
                    to withhold no documents in full, excise a paragraph or more in 3 documents, and
                    make minor excisions of less than a paragraph in 14 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume, and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide an accurate and comprehensive—given limitations of space—account of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration's complex policy
                    towards the Soviet Union, 1969–October 1970.</p>

                    of Congress (discussed below) and with other <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    files in the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials
                    such as the Country Files for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The
                    documentation on the Presidential transition, from November 1968 to January
                    1969, in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Office Files, is a unique
                    collection.</p>
                <p>Also part of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Project, <gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, are the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> Institutional Files (H-Files) that contain documents
                    distributed prior to each meeting of the National Security Council, Special
                    Review Group, Senior Review Group, and Washington Special Actions Group, and
                    other <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> sub-groups, along with detailed
                    minutes of most of these meetings. Instead of debating only US-Soviet relations,
                    most of these meetings touched upon US-Soviet interaction in multiple regional
                    conflicts. Other important collections in the H-Files that highlight the Soviet
                    Union are the files on the National Security Study Memoranda (<gloss
                        target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>s) and National Security Decision Memoranda
                        (<gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>s).</p>
                <p>Besides the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Files, the <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Materials include the White House Central
                    Files, which include Staff Member and Office Files, Subject files and Name
                    files. Within the Central Files are the White House Special Files, a
                    Confidential File which also includes Staff Member and Office Files, Subject
                    Files, and Name Files. The White House Central Files generally contain few
                    materials on Soviet policies and were therefore of little value for this volume.
                    The White House Special Files are marginally more valuable. The most important
                    resource in the White House Central Files is the President's Daily Diary, which
                    lists all those who met with the President at the White House or while he was
                    traveling. The Diary also indicates telephone calls to and from the President
                    and has a daily record of “Presidential Movements.”</p>
                <p>The 303/40 Committee record and subject files of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Intelligence files provide information on covert
                    operations policy. The 303 Committee (later called the 40 Committee) officially
                    approved covert operations, and its records contain agendas and minutes for 303
                    and <pb n="XIII" xml:id="pg_XIII" facs="0014"/>40 Committee meetings as well as
                    documents submitted by various agencies to the Committee.</p>
                <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry A. Kissinger</persName> Papers located in
                    the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress largely replicate
                    documentation found in other collections, especially the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> Files at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    Presidential materials. The editor found the most useful parts of the <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> papers for this volume to be the
                    Chronological Files, Memoranda of Conversations, Memoranda for the President,
                    and a collection of documents organized by country under the Geopolitical Files
                    heading. Since this volume was compiled, copies of the most important source—the
                        <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Telephone Conversation
                    Transcripts—have been deposited at the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Project at the National Archives. Although the citations
                    in this volume refer to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> Papers,
                    copies of the transcripts as organized in the original collection are available
                    to the public at the National Archives.</p>
                <p>The Department of State, Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, which were strong bureaucratic players in past Soviet volumes, play a
                    much reduced role under President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, who concentrated
                    policy in their own hands. There are far fewer Department of State documents
                    that play a key role in policy decisions towards the Soviet Union, since the
                    Secretary of State and his Department were essentially excluded from key policy
                    decision-making on the Soviet Union. The one exception is the early Assistant
                    Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>-Ambassador
                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> talks on the Middle East.
                    Still, some of the Department of State's Central Files most useful for other
                    discussions between U.S. diplomats in the field and Soviet officials are POL
                        US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, POL 1 US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                        >USSR</gloss>, and POL 1 <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency records are valuable for intelligence on Soviet
                    policy generally and Soviet policies towards specific regions. The editor
                    selected primarily <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> records on general Soviet
                    policies. Collections under <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> custody of value
                    are the <gloss target="#t_DCI1">DCI</gloss>
                    <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> and <gloss target="#t_DCI1"
                        >DCI</gloss> Executive Registry Files. The Department of Defense and
                    Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Melvin Laird</persName> were
                    key players concerning Soviet strategic capabilities, but they were not part of
                    the inner circle on U.S.-Soviet policy run out of the White House. When key
                    memoranda from Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                    are printed, they are almost always from the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> Presidential Materials, <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> Files. Department of Defense files used in this volume are
                    listed below. At the Ford Library, there is a collection of documents that cover
                        <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s tenure as Secretary of
                    Defense. His staff chose these <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>
                    Papers at the end of his term as Secretary of Defense with a view to documenting
                    his major decisions, but few of these materials document general Soviet
                    policies. Defense related records that were not available at the time that this
                    volume <pb n="XIV" xml:id="pg_XIV" facs="0015"/>was researched, but that deserve
                    mention as potential sources, are the Official Records of Chairman of the Joint
                    Chiefs, General Earle G. Wheeler, <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 218, at the
                    National Archives.</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume covers a period for which
                    there were no White House Presidential tape recordings. Their absence places a
                    premium on the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> telephone
                    transcripts and the <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> Diaries to
                    provide the contemporary and impromptu records behind the more official
                    documentation of cables, memoranda, and memoranda of conversation.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and most of these
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives.</p>

                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in

                <p>The Special Group and the 303 Committee approved 163 covert actions during the

                        >CIA</gloss> since 1961, only 14 percent were considered on a case-by-case
                    basis by the 303 Committee and its predecessors (and successors). Those not
                    reviewed by the 303 Committee were low-risk and low-cost operations. The Final
                    Report also cited a February 1967 <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memorandum
                    that included a description of the mode of policy arbitration of decisions on
                    covert actions within the 303 Committee system. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                        >CIA</gloss> presentations were questioned, amended, and even on occasion

                <p>The effectiveness of covert action has always been difficult for any
                    administration to gauge, given concerns about security and the difficulty of
                    judging the impact of U.S. initiatives on events. In October 1969 the new

                                for signature in Washington, London, and Moscow. On March 5, 1970,

                            not believe that political and strategic issues could be completely
                            separated. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>

                            during the period of withdrawal? I said this was correct. He asked how
                            long a time I had set—in my own mind—for withdrawal. I replied
                            three–five years, although this was obviously subject to negotiation. I
                            added <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0036"/>that as long as American

                            DECISION</p>
                        <p>A number of matters concerning either directly or indirectly our
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will need
                            prompt attention after January 20. They are of sufficient importance to
                            the whole nature of this relationship that, ideally, it would be
                            preferable for us to clarify our general purposes and interests before
                            we take further action. However, as a practical matter a hiatus in
                            US-Soviet relations will be hard to arrange and probably even
                            undesirable because important events should not be permitted to unfold
                            without our exerting influence upon them.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, pending a more thoroughgoing reexamination of our Soviet
                            policy, we should get some general guidelines—relating perhaps more to
                            style than substance—and take such early decisions as we must in
                            conformity with them.</p>
                        <p>Without here engaging in extensive supporting argumentation, I suggest
                            three broad guidelines: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Although for several reasons there are special, indeed unique
                                    features in the US-Soviet relationship, we should establish a
                                    scale of priorities in which relations with our allies normally
                                    take precedence.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>We should take account of the obviously special position of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in world affairs by
                                    maintaining diplomatic contact with it; but our approach should
                                    be one of aloofness. If we judge that there are issues on which
                                    our interests intersect, the Soviets will presumably discern
                                    them also. There is no automatic net advantage in our assuming
                                    the initiative or in our becoming deeply engaged with the
                                    Soviets in all such cases. Certainly, and in line with point 1
                                    above, when important interests of other states are also at
                                    stake, US-Soviet bilateralism must be tempered by due regard to
                                    those interests. Moreover, commonly held views that certain
                                    problems can be coped with only through intimate US-Soviet
                                    collaboration require reexamination. In any event, great zeal in
                                    approaching the Soviets or in responding to their overtures
                                    should be avoided as a general rule, certainly at the outset of
                                    the Administration.</item>

                                <item>We have no interest in deliberately seeking crises with the
                                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or even in striking
                                    out on policy paths that we judge would carry some substantial
                                    risk of crises. But we might encounter a Soviet attempt to <pb

                                    in some confrontation. In that case, we must stand our ground—or
                                    help an ally do so, if that should be the testing ground.</item>

                        <p>Apart from these general aspects of our approach, we should arrive at a
                            more or less coherent posture with respect to the Soviet occupation of

                            the realms of contacts and protocol as we took to convey our indignation
                            have now probably outlived their purpose (though we should not in any
                            case return to some of the excessive comraderie that occasionally
                            occurred in the past). But two general points should be conveyed clearly
                            to the Soviets through the various channels available: (1) That any
                            instance of direct and gross Soviet intervention in Czechoslovak
                            internal affairs is bound to retard establishment of a business-like
                            relationship with us; and (2) that while the US recognizes the special
                            and sensitive nature of Soviet relations with countries that are
                            immediately adjacent to it and part of its alliance system, we will not
                            let the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> control the character and
                            pace of our relations with these countries. In our approach we should be
                            guided by the proposition that we should not be reluctant to
                            compartmentalize our affairs with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> if that suits our interests, but we should not
                            cooperate in the obvious Soviet effort to make the outside world accept
                            total Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe and to make the conduct of our
                            policy toward Eastern Europe subject to Soviet sanction.</p>

                        <p>As always the reasons for the Soviet initiative are open to speculation.
                            They may reflect genuine Soviet concern with the explosiveness of the
                            present situation. In any case, the new Administration inherits <pb
                                n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0040"/>an active US-Soviet exchange of
                            communications in this area, rather than a state of acute US-Soviet
                            crisis. In this respect, Soviet moves on the Middle East fit into other
                            post-Czechoslovak, pre-January 20 efforts by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to damp down open hostility toward us
                            and, indeed, to engage us diplomatically.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, there remain fundamental issues in controversy between
                            ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the
                            Mediterranean and adjacent regions, not least a continuing Soviet effort
                            to project power and influence there to our detriment.</p>
                        <p>Plainly, the US must remain in touch with the Soviets on the Middle East
                            (1) because it may be one (though not the only) way of preventing
                            renewed large-scale hostilities with a potential for a direct US-Soviet
                            military clash, and (2) because the Soviets have great influence in the
                            Arab country (UAR) that is the key to any tranquilization of Middle East
                            tensions and dangers. Moreover, in the exchanges with us the Soviets
                            have over time inched away from some of the most rigid Arab positions.
                            But US-Soviet dialogue should not be the only means by which we seek to
                            cope with the dangers of the region. Any settlement, partial, temporary
                            or complete, requires the assent of the parties. So-called imposed
                            settlements are not likely to be viable; moreover the implication of
                            US-Soviet condominium (itself of questionable viability over any length
                            of time) that an imposed solution would carry would gravely damage our
                            alliance relationships elsewhere. It would involve, in addition, a basic

                                the Soviet Union informed the United States that it was prepared to

                                their countries in Geneva on September 30, 1968. As a result of the
                                Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the United States delayed the
                                opening of talks but never formally answered the Soviet
                                communication proposing the beginning of such negotiations on
                                September 30.</note> were complex. Among the considerations that
                            played a role was probably a desire to exert some influence against
                            certain new weapons decisions by the US. If so, the Soviets may seek to
                            get the talks underway soon after inauguration.</p>
                        <p>In the US, both inside the government and outside, much of the sense of
                            urgency about getting these talks begun stemmed from a judgment that the
                            present moment in time was unusually propitious, and also unusually
                            crucial, in seeking to curb US-Soviet arms competition. There is no need
                            to rehearse here the rationale for the US initiative; it has been well
                            and amply presented and whatever one may think about some of it, the
                            general case for US-Soviet talks in this field is persuasive.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the incoming administration will wish to make its own
                            assessment of the present and prospective strategic balance and set its
                            own objections for any direct dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> on this subject. Moreover, there is a real need to
                            take our European allies more completely into our confidence about the
                            direction in which we would like to see the strategic relationship
                            develop. The Germans, in particular, need to be reassured that whatever
                            we do—be it by some form of arrangement with the Russians or through
                            unilateral decisions—will not ignore the strategic “threat” against
                            Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>The process of internal US review and interallied consultation will take
                            some time and dictate some delay in the opening of formal US-Soviet
                            talks. The Soviets should be informed of these reasons for delay. Since
                            the US has in the exchanges of the past two years already given the
                            Soviets some indication of its approach (at least under the previous
                            Administration) the Soviets should be encouraged to give <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="pg_9" facs="0042"/>some indication of theirs. Whatever the
                            eventual changes of formal or explicit agreement, it will be desirable
                            to draw the Soviets into conversation on strategic issues. If the
                            opportunity arises (though we need not soon go out of our way to seek
                            it) we should engage in such conversation. Our purpose, whatever the
                            pros and cons or the practicality of specific agreements, should be to
                            learn more about the processes of interaction that operate in the
                            US-Soviet military relationship and to induce similar awareness on the
                            part of the Soviets.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Soviets some time ago gave us, the British and the French a
                            relatively mild complaint and warning about the Bundesversammlung. The
                            tone and content of these oral démarches and subsequent Soviet talks
                            with the Germans suggest that the Soviets have not yet reached a
                            decision about their course of action. They have obviously set up a
                            basis for harassment or worse; or they may also try to argue or bargain
                            the Western powers and/or the Germans out of holding the meeting. There
                            are several other possibilities or combinations. In any case, we are on
                            record as approving the meeting if the Germans want to hold it.
                            Consequently we should avoid extensive argument with the Soviets before
                            the meeting date and we should delay a rejection of the Soviet démarche
                            until shortly before March 5. Since our response will presumably be the
                            first policy statement to the Soviets on German issues by the new
                            Administration we should use the occasion not only to rebut the specific
                            Soviet complaint but to set forth a more general affirmation of the
                            legitimacy of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s role in
                            safeguarding West Berlin's viability and of the responsibility of the
                            Western allies for ensuring that that role conforms to four power
                            agreements as we interpret them. Because of difficulties with the French
                            we can probably do no more than to affirm these principles in general.
                            We do need to give fresh thought to the future of Berlin and some time
                            after the Bundesversammlung hurdle has been crossed should look toward
                            inter-allied consultations.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we cannot ignore the danger of Soviet and East German
                            harrassment and the possibility that Berlin may become an early testing
                            ground of the administration's conduct in a crisis. Contingency plans
                            should be promptly examined and if necessary updated and revised.</p>
                        <p>There are signs that a Soviet-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            dialogue on various matters, including non-use of force, is being
                            reviewed. At the procedural level we should ensure promptly that the
                            Germans keep us fully informed and consult on issues involving our
                            interests. We must recognize, however, <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10"
                                facs="0043"/>that consultations are a two-way street and that German
                            candor will in some measure reflect our own readiness to engage in
                            meaningful consultations.</p>

                        <p>We may soon get Soviet soundings about an early top level meeting. Soviet
                            reasons for seeking such encounters in the past have been varied
                            (including inter alia, Khrushchev's hankering for the limelight, a
                            general impulse to deal with the head of the other superpower sometimes
                            on the assumption that he may be more “reasonable” than his
                            subordinates, considerations of prestige relating to internal Soviet
                            politics, hopes of generating concern among our allies or in Peking,
                            expectations of settling some specific issue, etc. etc.). American
                            Presidents have had their own impulses and objectives, some not wholly
                            dissimilar from those animating the Soviet leaders.</p>
                        <p>A broad exchange of views in which the President sets forth his approach
                            directly to one or more of the members of the Soviet collective has some
                            virtue and should probably be considered some time during the first year
                            of the Administration. (Experience with the specific agreements made at
                            summits with the Soviets has been less than encouraging, however, and it
                            is not advisable to look to this device for that purpose.) High-level
                            meetings with our major allies and perhaps with one or two important
                            neutrals should have precedence over a summit with the Soviets and any
                            overtures from Moscow should be handled accordingly.</p>

                            Contingency planning has been underway within the US government and at
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for some time. Although
                            tensions in the Balkans have subsided, the potential for Soviet moves

                            may not find it possible to do in the event, and whatever short and
                            long-term problems the Soviets would create for themselves if they did
                            move against these two countries, the US retains a basic interest in the
                            preservation of their present status of independence (or relative
                            autonomy in the case of Romania).</p>
                        <p>Both countries, though to different degree, have indicated that they
                            regard their network of foreign relations and contacts as one form of
                            insurance against possible Soviet attack. Given the limited and highly
                            unpleasant options available to us in the event of a Soviet attack, we
                            have a substantial interest in strengthening now such deterrents as may
                            be operating on the Soviets. The new Administration should be responsive

                            indicated their interest in regular consultations and we should

                            international situation as of January 20, 1969. He wishes the review to
                            provide a current assessment of the political, economic and security
                            situation and the major problems relevant to U.S. security interests and
                            U.S. bilateral and multilateral relations. In order to put this review
                            into effect he wishes to consider responses to the attached set of
                            questions along with other material considered relevant. The review
                            should include a discussion, where appropriate, of the data upon which
                            judgments are based, uncertainties regarding the data, and alternative
                            possible interpretations of the data.</p>
                        <p>The responses should be forwarded to the President by February 20,

                        <p>I asked when Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            would be returning to Washington. T. said <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                            on January 7 had entered a sanitarium where the treatment takes 30 days.

                            two might have better-than-ordinary opportunities for private chats. The
                            sanitarium is in a place whose name begins with a “B.” It is just
                            outside Moscow.</p>
                        <p>T. asked when President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            might be selecting a man to go to Moscow as U.S. Ambassador, and I
                            replied (in accordance with explicit instruction on this point by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>) that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> would be selecting his Ambassador
                            to Moscow within two weeks.</p>

                        <p>I opened the subject of missile talks early in the lunch, with the
                            observation that both T. and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had had conversations from time to time with me
                            in the past on the general subject of talks between the two countries;
                            that I had emphasized, in such past talks, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s awareness of the special
                            responsibilities of the United States and the U.S.S.R.; that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, in his acceptance
                            speech at Miami and in his Inaugural address, had said we moved from an
                            era of confrontation to an era of negotiation; that I had always
                            stressed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s view that
                            talks on various subjects are interrelated.</p>
                        <p>I stated further that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> approaches the question of talks with the Soviet
                            Union in the following spirit: that talks on complicated and important
                            matters such as these must always be conducted in a precise,
                            businesslike, and detailed manner; that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s background and life as a political man and
                            lawyer in the United States, as well as his extensive international
                            experience, have made it natural and imperative for him to place the
                            greatest importance on semantic and substantive precision in
                            international discussions; and that his news conference on Monday was
                            only the most recent example of this attitude.</p>
                        <p>I stated that the President has reached no decision to have talks on
                            missiles or any particular subject; that he is looking for evidence of
                            general political movement in many areas. I stated that, while such a
                            decision is under consideration, the President intends not to engage in
                            any kind of arms escalation.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the Middle East, and in response to my observation that
                            the Middle East would be an area in which the President would look for
                            political movement in connection with his overall consideration of a
                            decision whether or not to commence talks, T. made the point that his
                            own government has only limited influence over the principal Arab states
                            involved, i.e., Egypt, Jordan and Syria (although Syria is not as
                            significant a factor as Egypt and Jordan). In the case of Egypt, for
                            example, he made the point that Egypt is a defeated nation and there is
                            a limit to how far <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can be
                            pushed without destroying him from the standpoint of the internal

                                >NPT</gloss> if there should be further Soviet talk about Article 53

                        <p>I stated that it was President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s intention to end the war in Vietnam, one way or
                            another. I repeated this four times during the course of the lunch.</p>
                        <p>Each time I mentioned this point, I supplemented it with the observation
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> could not
                            end the war in Vietnam on a basis which would be interpreted as a
                            disadvantageous conclusion from the point of view of the United States,
                            after President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s
                            predecessor had fought and been eliminated from the political scene in
                            America for his pains.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned also that the Administration is aware of the assistance the
                            Soviet Union has put into the Paris negotiation situation, and <pb
                                n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0054"/>appreciates it; further, that it
                            is hoped the Soviet Government will be able to continue its positive
                            efforts in this area.</p>
                        <p>T. responded on this whole area at great length and with substantial
                            sophistication. Essentially, his point is that the Saigon regime is a
                            small minority regime, that the basic problem in Vietnam is an
                            indigenous Vietnamese problem, that the Soviet Government has limited
                            influence over the NLF, and that in the final analysis there was going
                            to have to be some kind of temporary, provisional coalition set up in
                            South Vietnam which will include the NLF in some way. I responded by
                            referring to various statements in President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s news conference of Monday, January 27, and in
                            general said these were matters that T. and I could not dispose of at
                            the lunch today.</p>
                        <p>I want to emphasize that T. expanded on these matters in great length and

                        <p>T. spent a substantial portion of time, and great energy, being defensive
                            about the Stalin era. He described how “upbeat” conditions were for
                            Soviet citizenry in the middle and late ‘30's and how unrealistic are
                            the current popular portrayals of that era by Western writers (as well
                            as Solzhenitsyn's portrayal).</p>
                        <p>He particularly stressed that he had noticed in the press a report that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> has on the table
                            by his bed in the White House a book entitled “The Great Purge”<note

                            talks on limiting offensive and defensive missiles, on Vietnam, on
                            Europe, and on the Middle East. As soon as it was appropriate <pb n="22"
                                xml:id="pg_22" facs="0055"/>to do so in the conversation, I went
                            back to that statement, quoted it to him, cited to him a statement that
                            had been made to me by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> in my home on Sunday evening, November 24,<note

                            his government is now prepared to start simultaneous talks on all these
                            subjects immediately. T. sparred over the question of the meaning of the
                            word “simultaneous”—did it mean simultaneous in place as well as time,
                            and did it mean simultaneous in a sense which would imply an
                            interrelationship to the extent that the substance of one subject would
                            be a condition for talks on the substance of another?</p>
                        <p>I replied that, as I had said earlier, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> had always had the view that talks on various
                            subjects are always interrelated and must be understood as taking place
                            in context with each other.</p>
                        <p>T. emphasized that his government was always highly sensitive to any
                            suggestion that one subject matter was being used to “blackmail” the
                            Soviet Government on another subject—that Walt Rostow had been quite
                            crude in his approach to the interrelationship of different subjects and
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had received such
                            severe backlash from the Kremlin when he reported one Rostow episode
                            along this line that he, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                            >Dobrynin</persName>, had simply not reported other Rostow episodes. T.
                            indicated that he would be unwilling to suggest any such proposal or
                            idea to his government, but expressed the belief that his government
                            would, in fact, agree to the simultaneous commencement of talks on all
                            the listed subjects with the understanding that all should be considered
                            within an interrelated context.</p>
                        <p>And then, I asked him if he would be willing to participate with me in
                            preparing a memorandum which would more precisely describe the
                            conditions that could surround such talks and an exact list of the
                            topics for discussion in such talks.</p>
                        <p>He agreed that he would do that if I would give him three or four days.
                            He will be back to me within three or four days for further

                        <p>On February 1, 1969, the National Security Council met to discuss the
                            Middle East. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                                Nixon</persName> listened to briefings by Director of Central
                            Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName> and by
                            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle Wheeler. According
                            to minutes of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                            described Soviet interests in the region as follows: “<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has leapfrogged Northern Tier. Soviet
                            naval expansion—steadier, more effective than Khrushchev's rather
                            opportunistic move to put missiles in Cuba.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> asked, “You talk about <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>'s ‘measured, effective plan.' Does this emanate from
                            military strategy or something that just happens? Do they have a meeting
                            like ours here today, decide on policy and then execute it? Or do they
                            just muddle along?” <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                            replied, “Highest level decision. Considered policy.”</p>
                        <p>General Wheeler's briefing on the significance of the Soviet fleet and
                            U.S. contingency plans for conflict in the region generated the
                            following comments and queries from <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>: “I understand your contingency plan is based on
                            intelligence estimate that local conflict [is] main possibility. I agree
                            that US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> conflict remote, but what
                            if one of Arab countries where Soviet fleet present is attacked?”
                            Wheeler replied, “Possibilities we are examining: U.S. attack on Soviet
                            bases in Siberia; sink one Soviet ship in Mediterranean; seize Soviet
                            intelligence trawler.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then asked, “Could you
                            consider what we could do indirectly through the Israelis? Seems to me
                            Soviet naval presence is primarily political. Therefore, we must be
                            prepared for a less-than-military contingency.” Wheeler responded,
                            “Primarily political. But Soviet presence in ports puts a Soviet
                            umbrella over those ports. In a tenuous sense, fleet therefore does have
                            military use.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                            that summarized the policy recommendations made at the <gloss

                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> urged that “we should
                            particularly concentrate on U.S.-Soviet arrangements which could slow
                            the pace of the Near Eastern arms race and serve as a restraining
                            influence on the nations in the area—at least arrangements which would
                            assure U.S.–U.S.S.R. disengagement if hostilities break out again.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then layed out the
                            pros and cons of a two-power dialogue with the Soviets as opposed to the
                            advantages and disadvantages of the four-power (Great Britain, France,

                                            to this point are that all the Arabs know only the U.S.
                                            can move Israel; that settlement which has even a remote

                                            win popularity by pushing it; and that the U.S. can hold

                                        <item>“b. We have no strong evidence that the Soviets want
                                            the kind of basic peace settlement we have been seeking.
                                            Although their intent is debatable, they seem to be
                                            aiming at a limited accommodation to reduce the
                                            possibility of a sudden crisis with dangerous and
                                            unforeseeable consequences. Limited accommodation would
                                            leave enough unsettled grievances for them to use in
                                            keeping the Arabs dependent on their support. If the
                                            Soviets are not sincere, we risk walking into a
                                            propaganda trap. The counters to this are that the
                                            Soviets are the ones who have persistently pushed this
                                            dialogue, that they have already moved toward our
                                            position and that we will never know their real position
                                            until we pin them down in negotiation.</item>

                                            with anyone, though they are likely to react somewhat
                                            less sharply to the two-power than to the four-power
                                            approach. Agreement directly between them and the Arabs
                                            is fundamental to their position—and, they believe, to
                                            ours. They hold that a lasting settlement cannot result
                                            unless the parties themselves develop one they can live
                                            with. If we went down either the two-power or the

                                            worst of all, we had undercut their position by
                                            compromising on the central point in that

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>I have been giving much thought to our relations with the Soviet Union
                            and would like to give you, informally, my ideas on this central
                            security problem. My purpose in doing so is not to prejudge the
                            scheduled systematic review by the National Security Council of our
                            policy options with respect to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, but rather to set out the general approach which I
                            believe should guide us in our conduct as we move from confrontation to
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>I believe that the tone of our public and private discourse about
                                and with the Soviet Union should be calm, courteous and
                                non-polemical. This will not prevent us from stating our views
                                clearly and, if need be, firmly; nor will it preclude us from
                                candidly affirming our attitude—negatively if warranted—toward the
                                policies and actions of the Soviet Union. But what I said in my
                                Inaugural address concerning the tone and character of our domestic
                                    debates<note n="2" xml:id="d10fn2">The passage in <persName
                                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s inaugural address
                                    reads: “In these difficult years, America has suffered from a
                                    fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than
                                    it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into
                                    hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of
                                    persuading. We cannot learn from one another until we stop
                                    shouting at one another—until we speak quietly enough so that
                                    our words can be heard as well as our voices.” (<hi

                                also govern the tone and character of our statements in the
                                international arena, most especially in respect of the Soviet
                                Union.</item>

                            <item>I believe that the basis for a viable settlement is a mutual
                                recognition of our vital interests. We must recognize that the
                                Soviet Union has interests; in the present circumstances we cannot
                                but take account of them in defining our own. We should leave the
                                Soviet leadership in no doubt that we expect them to adopt a similar
                                approach toward us. This applies also to the concerns and interests
                                of our allies and indeed of all nations. They too are entitled to
                                the safeguarding of their legitimate interests. In the past, we have
                                often attempted to settle things in a fit of enthusiasm, relying on
                                personal diplomacy. But the “spirit” that permeated various meetings
                                lacked a solid basis of mutual interest, and therefore, every summit
                                was followed by a crisis in less than a year.</item>
                            <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0060"/>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I am convinced that the great issues are fundamentally
                                interrelated. I do not mean by this to establish artificial linkages
                                between specific elements of one or another issue or between
                                tactical steps that we may elect to take. But I do believe that
                                crisis or confrontation in one place and real cooperation in another
                                cannot long be sustained simultaneously. I recognize that the
                                previous Administration took the view that when we perceive a mutual
                                interest on an issue with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                                we should pursue agreement and attempt to insulate it as much as
                                possible from the ups and downs of conflicts elsewhere. This may
                                well be sound on numerous bilateral and practical matters such as
                                cultural or scientific exchanges. But, on the crucial issues of our
                                day, I believe we must seek to advance on a front at least broad
                                enough to make clear that we see some relationship between political
                                and military issues. I believe that the Soviet leaders should be
                                brought to understand that they cannot expect to reap the benefits
                                of cooperation in one area while seeking to take advantage of
                                tension or confrontation elsewhere. Such a course involves the
                                danger that the Soviets will use talks on arms as a safety valve on
                                intransigence elsewhere. I note for example that the invasion of
                                Hungary was followed by abortive disarmament talks within nine
                                    months.<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3">Reference is to the Soviet

                                what I have in mind in one case of immediate and widespread
                                interest—the proposed talks on strategic weapons. I believe our
                                decision on when and how to proceed does not depend exclusively on
                                our review of the purely military and technical issues, although
                                these are of key importance. This decision should also be taken in
                                the light of the prevailing political context and, in particular, in
                                light of progress <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0061"/>toward
                                stabilizing the explosive Middle East situation, and in light of the
                                Paris talks. I believe I should retain the freedom to ensure, to the
                                extent that we have control over it, that the timing of talks with
                                the Soviet Union on strategic weapons is optimal. This may, in fact,
                                mean delay beyond that required for our review of the technical
                                issues. Indeed, it means that we should—at least in our public
                                position—keep open the option that there may be no talks at
                                all.</item>

                                this country. But I think it is important to establish with the
                                Soviets early in the Administration that our commitment to
                                negotiation applies to a range of major issues so that the
                                “structure of peace” to which I referred in the Inaugural will have

                        <p>I had lunch with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>
                            today. While there the President sent for both of us and chatted with us
                            while having his lunch at his desk. The following are the
                            highlights:</p>
                        <p>I urged that we proceed as rapidly as possible to set up arrangements for
                            strategic missile talks with the Soviets although obviously not until he
                            returned from his European trip.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">On February
                                23 <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> left for an 8-day
                                visit to Europe on his first foreign trip as President.</note> I
                            argued briefly with the President and at greater length earlier with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName> that we not attempt to
                            tie the start of talks with political concessions from the Soviets. I
                            thought that to so do might have the opposite effect than the one we
                            intended. I got the impression that the President was inclined to agree.
                            I also suggested that we drop the idea of agreeing to a set of
                            principles before starting the talks.</p>
                        <p>I told the President I thought we should be careful not to feed Soviet
                            suspicions about the possibility of our ganging up with Communist <pb
                                n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0062"/>China against them. In reply to
                            his question I said I was not referring to his public statements on this
                            matter as the Soviets would understand that we would pursue our national
                            interests. Rather I was thinking of any hints or actions that indicated
                            something was going on under the table. As a specific example I
                            mentioned the possible shifting of our talks with the Chinese in Prague
                            from the present location which the Soviets have doubtless bugged to our
                            respective Embassies. (I understand the Chinese have turned this
                            down.)</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the importance of close understanding between
                            you and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I gathered
                            that both he and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName> were
                            disturbed by press reports of [friction] between the Department and the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> staff.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was not fanatical about the idea of summit talks.
                            Nevertheless he thought that summit talks with the Soviets would
                            eventually take place and asked for my thoughts on timing. I said I
                            thought it was important to proceed first with one or two important
                            problems. Ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty would be useful
                            but I thought it would also be wise at least to have started the Missile
                            talks. If they succeeded, this would create a favorable atmosphere—if
                            they got stuck perhaps the President could resolve the difficulty on his
                            level.</p>
                        <p>In this connection I said I thought some changes in the Soviet leadership
                            were quite possible before the year was out.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if I would help in the planning of any eventual
                            summit meeting with the Soviets and I said I would be happy to do
                            so.</p>
                        <p>In my earlier talk with <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName> I
                            said that if Missile talks with the Soviets were set, I thought this
                            would diminish the likelihood of the Soviets stirring up trouble in
                            Berlin over the meeting there of the Bundesversammlung.<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>The President said he had not met Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. I said I thought the top Soviet leaders had
                            confidence in his judgment and that he had never deceived me, unless he
                            in fact knew about the missiles in Cuba, which I did not think was the
                            case. The President asked if there was any reason why he should not see
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> after the
                            forthcoming European trip. I said I thought it was quite proper. He said
                            he might ask him to an informal lunch.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to a talk we had in Moscow in 1967 when I told him
                            the Soviets were prejudiced against him. He asked what their present
                            attitude was. I said that they had been relatively correct in their
                            attitude during the election campaign and since. They had <pb n="30"
                                xml:id="pg_30" facs="0063"/>been impressed by his conduct of the
                            campaign and had referred favorably to his remarks about negotiations.
                            They were, however, always suspicious and would be examining carefully
                            his first moves in the field of foreign affairs.</p>

                            was under instructions from his government to seek an appointment with

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s recollection, related
                            in his <hi rend="italic">White House Years</hi> (page 141), of the
                            decision to exclude <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> from
                            the first meeting with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            is as follows: “Procedurally, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> wished to establish his dominance <pb n="31"
                                xml:id="pg_31" facs="0064"/>over negotiations with the Soviet Union;
                            in his mind, this required the exclusion of <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName>, who might be too anxious and who might claim
                            credit for whatever progress might be made. Substantively, he wanted to
                            begin the linkage approach at his own pace. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> sought to solve the <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> problem in his customary fashion by letting
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> bear the onus (and
                            no doubt <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> laid it off on
                            me). <persName corresp="#p_HHR1">Haldeman</persName> told the Secretary
                            of State that the best guarantee for not raising expectations was for
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> to be absent from the
                            meeting. Attendance by <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            would convey a sense of urgency contrary to our strategy; it might lead
                            to an undue sense of urgency.”</p>

                                to inform me that he was under instructions from his government to
                                seek an appointment with you, at your convenience, but hopefully
                                within the next day or two. He gave no indication that he was
                                carrying a message but merely stated that he had been asked by his
                                government to convey to you its current views on the most important
                                international issues. He planned to tell you how the Soviet
                                Government presently views U.S.-Soviet relations and how these
                                relations might develop in the future. Your views on the questions
                                raised, he said, would be appreciated. I said I would be in touch
                                with him as soon as I had any information to pass on.</p>
                            <p>I took advantage of his call to express our concern over the

                                as our concern over developments involving Berlin. Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> seemed unaware
                                of <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0069"/>any danger signals in
                                Viet-Nam. He simply repeated his government's position that the
                                Soviet Union would continue to be helpful with respect to the
                                negotiations on Viet-Nam, assuming that the U.S. accepted the
                                equality of all participants in those negotiations.</p>
                            <p>On Berlin, he was at pains to underline that the U.S. should not
                                misread developments there. The Soviet Union did not wish to do
                                anything to jeopardize relations with the U.S. What was happening
                                with respect to Berlin was merely a reaction to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> decision to convene the
                                Bundesversammlung there. He added that the Soviet Union did not want
                                Berlin and that it was not asking that the East Germans should get
                                it. At the same time, the Soviet Union is not prepared to give West
                                Berlin to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also underlined
                                that actions taken by East Germany were not in any way related to
                                your planned visit to Berlin.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the Middle East, he indicated that the Soviet
                                Government evidently does not intend to reply formally to the
                                previous Administration's last communication on that subject. He
                                said that the Soviets were prepared to discuss this matter in detail
                                both bilaterally and in a Four-Power context. Discussions could take
                                place in New York, Moscow and here.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also said
                                that the Soviet Union remained ready to initiate discussions on the
                                limitation of offensive and defensive missile systems. He thought it
                                unfortunate, however, if this matter were to be linked with progress
                                on other issues.</p>
                            <p>I emphasized during the course of the conversation that we hoped the
                                Soviet Union would be helpful with respect to Viet-Nam and that the
                                Soviet Government should advise East Germany to play Berlin in a low
                                key.</p>

                        <p>The President greeted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> in the Fish Room and escorted him into his
                            office for a brief private chat. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> told the President privately that, before his
                            departure from Moscow last week, he had spent two days at a government
                            dacha outside Moscow with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> and the message that
                            he carried was based on his talks with the leadership. The President
                            should understand, therefore, that what he had to say on substantive
                            issues was an accurate reflection of the views of the leadership.</p>
                        <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM9">Toon</persName> joined the President, the
                            President gave the floor to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that his government
                            had noted with interest President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s statement that his Administration looked forward
                            to an era of negotiations, not confrontation. He could assure the
                            President that the Soviet Government shared this view and was prepared
                            to do its part to see to it that the period that lies ahead was truly
                            one of negotiations and not confrontation. This was on the
                            understanding, of course, that the issues to be negotiated and the
                            subjects to be discussed would be by mutual agreement, that negotiations
                            would not be pursued simply for their own sake but for the purpose of
                            bringing about constructive results. Past experience indicated the
                            importance of beginning negotiations as soon as possible. Delay could be
                            harmful, and it was important therefore to recognize the desirability of
                            moving ahead at an early date. The Ambassador had been instructed by his
                            government to ascertain precisely what the President had in mind by
                            negotiations—specifically what issues the President felt should be the
                            subject of negotiations and when, where, and at what level these should
                                <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0071"/>take place. So far as the
                            Soviet Government was concerned, negotiations and an exchange of views
                            on various subjects and at various levels could take place
                            simultaneously. It was not excluded that at an appropriate time
                            discussions could be carried on at the Summit level.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> what he meant by his statement that
                            negotiations on various issues could be carried on simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> referred to the
                            President's remarks at his first press conference concerning the Middle
                            East situation and the arms race.<note n="2" xml:id="d14fn2">During
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s first press
                                conference on January 27, the President was asked where he stood on
                                starting missile talks with the Soviets. He replied that he
                                preferred “to steer a course between those two extremes” of waiting
                                until there was “progress on political settlements” and moving
                                forward without such political talks. “What I want to do is to see
                                to it that we have strategic arms talks in a way and at a time that
                                will promote, if possible, progress on outstanding political
                                problems at the same time—for example, on the problem of the Mideast
                                and on other outstanding problems in which the United States and the
                                Soviet Union, acting together, can serve the cause of peace.” A full
                                text of the conference is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers:
                                        <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, 1969</hi>, pp.
                                15–23.</note> The Soviet Government was prepared to use its
                            influence on parties directly involved in the Middle East situation to
                            help arrive at a solution of the problem. Depending on the President's
                            views, talks on the Middle East problem could take place in New York or
                            Washington and also in Moscow, either with the American Embassy there or
                            with a special emissary, if the President desired to send one. With
                            regard to the so-called arms race, the Soviet Government was prepared to
                            reach agreement on limitation and subsequent reduction of both offensive
                            and defensive strategic missiles. As the President was aware, certain
                            aspects of this question had already been discussed with the previous
                            Administration. Both sides had agreed on the desirability of early
                            initiation of talks on the missile problem, although there had not been
                            full agreement on a procedural aspect, which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> understood related to the
                            level at which the talks should begin. In any case, he was instructed by
                            his government to inform the President that the Soviet side was prepared
                            to begin talks now and to ascertain from the President his ideas on
                            where, when, and at what level talks might begin. The Soviet Government
                            was not pressing for an early reply but, in its view, discussions of the
                            arms control problem as well as the Middle East problem were worth
                            pursuing and could be carried on simultaneously. Certainly, the Soviet
                            Government was under no illusion that the solutions to either problem
                            could be achieved overnight, but it felt that a beginning should be
                            made. While other subjects might be discussed, and in this respect
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was prepared
                            to hear our own suggestions either through Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> or the State Department, it
                            was his government's view that the two subjects he had <pb n="39"
                                xml:id="pg_39" facs="0072"/>mentioned—the Middle East and the arms
                            control—were among the most important which should engage our early
                            attention.</p>
                        <p>The President thanked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> for his forthright statement of the Soviet
                            Government's position. The President wished to make clear that his
                            Administration began its tasks with a fresh viewpoint and with an eye to
                            the future. Since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> referred to a possible Summit meeting, the
                            President wished to make clear that he shared the view that at some
                            point a meeting of Heads of Government might be useful. The President
                            felt, however, that such meetings must be based on a carefully prepared
                            agenda and be preceded by adequate preparatory work on the issues to be
                            discussed and possibly on which agreements might be reached. Without
                            adequate preparations, Summit meetings could be harmful, since
                            expectations of results might not be met. The President did not believe
                            in a Summit meeting simply for the sake of bringing together the Heads
                            of Government. Some specific purpose must be served, and the President
                            felt strongly that we should now discuss at lower levels the principal
                            issues before us so that ultimately when there should be a Summit
                            meeting it would have constructive results.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the President wished to set forth in a completely candid way
                            his view of the relationship between the two super powers, as they are
                            now commonly referred to. We must recognize that there are basic
                            differences between us. This has been true historically of the
                            relationship between great powers, and it is equally true now. We both
                            have a responsibility to moderate these differences, to see to it that
                            they do not result in a sharp confrontation, and in the President's view
                            the most effective way of doing this was to keep the lines of
                            communication open. This is the task of diplomacy—to recognize that
                            great powers will differ and to insure that differences be resolved by
                            peaceful means.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the President wished to stress the importance of eliminating
                            those areas of friction where our own fundamental interests are not
                            involved. We know from history that great powers can be drawn into a
                            confrontation with each other as a result of actions by other nations.
                            The President felt, for example, that it would be the height of folly to
                            let the parties directly involved in the Middle East conflict bring
                            about a confrontation between Moscow and Washington. It is particularly
                            for this reason that the President attached great importance to an
                            exchange of views, either bilaterally or in a multilateral forum on the
                            Middle East situation.</p>
                        <p>The strategic arms problem involves primarily the United States and the
                            Soviet Union, although both sides, of course, must consult, as
                            necessary, with their Allies. The President wished to make clear his
                            views on the relationship between strategic arms talks and progress on
                            political issues. It was not his view that the initiation of such talks
                            must <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0073"/>be conditioned on the
                            settlement of larger political issues. We both recognize that the
                            principal purpose of strategic arms talks is peace, but there is no
                            guarantee that freezing strategic weapons at the present level alone
                            would bring about peace. History makes clear that wars result from
                            political differences and political problems. It is incumbent upon us,
                            therefore, when we begin strategic arms talks to do what we can in a
                            parallel way to de-fuse critical political situations such as the Middle
                            East and Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if his
                            understanding was correct that the President favored simultaneous
                            discussion of the problems which the President had mentioned. The
                            Ambassador recognized, of course, that it might not be possible to
                            discuss all problems at the same time, and he was not pressing the
                            President to set the exact time for beginning arms talks. He wanted
                            simply to clarify his own understanding of the linkage between arms
                            talks and negotiations on political issues. His government, of course,
                            would be interested in having a more precise idea as to when the
                            President would be prepared to begin an exchange of views on the missile
                            problem, even if preliminary and at the level of experts.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that it was his hope that we would soon be able to
                            decide the question of timing. First, of course, the Administration
                            would wish thoroughly to examine the whole problem and our position on
                            it. This would probably have to await his return from Europe. In any
                            case, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                            aware, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Gerard Smith</persName> had just
                            recently been appointed Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
                                Agency<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> submitted <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName>'s name to the Senate for
                                confirmation on January 31; he was confirmed on February 7.</note>
                            and he was now engaged in reviewing our entire position on arms control
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Middle East situation, the President wished to review
                            the question of modalities for our bilateral discussions with Ambassador
                            Yost and others. The President is gratified to learn that the Soviets
                            are prepared to do what they can to cool the situation, and certainly
                            the President himself would do everything in his power to bring this
                            about.</p>
                        <p>On Viet-Nam the President recognized that the Soviet position was
                            somewhat more delicate than our own since the Soviets were not directly
                            involved in the problem. The President knew, however, that the Soviet
                            Government has an interest in terminating the conflict and had played a
                            helpful role in getting the Paris talks started. For our part, we are
                            prepared to go “the extra mile” in Paris, but the Soviets should
                            understand clearly that the American public will not tolerate endless
                                <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0074"/>discussions there. The
                            Administration's determination is to bring the conflict to an end, one
                            way or another. We hope that the Soviets will do what they can to get
                            the Paris talks off dead-center.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would like to
                            speak briefly of the Soviet position on the Paris talks. The Soviet
                            Government had welcomed their initiation and it was their view that if
                            all participants in the Paris talks would face realities and treat each
                            other on an equal basis, then the Soviets might be in a position to play
                            a constructive role. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said that he agreed generally with the President's statement that
                            progress in one area is bound to affect progress in other areas. He
                            thought, however, that it was useful to make a beginning and it would be
                            wise not to begin with the most difficult issues. Often small steps can
                            have influence.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he wished to make clear that it was not his view
                            that agreement on one issue must be conditioned by settlement of other
                            issues. The President wished to express his conviction, however, that
                            progress in area is bound to have an influence on progress all other
                            areas. The current situation in Berlin is a case in point. If the Berlin
                            situation should deteriorate, Senate approval of the Nonproliferation
                            Treaty would be much more difficult. The President wished to make clear
                            that he favored early ratification of the treaty and he is optimistic
                            that the Senate will act favorably in the near future. We should bear in
                            mind, however, that just as the situation in Czechoslovakia had
                            influenced the outlook for the treaty last fall, so would the situation
                            in Berlin now have an important bearing on the Senate's attitude.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had mentioned
                            the desirability of making progress on some issues, even if settlement
                            of other issues should not be feasible. The Non-Proliferation Treaty is
                            just such an issue. If we can move ahead on this it would be helpful in
                            our efforts on other issues. The only cloud on the horizon is Berlin and
                            the President hoped that the Soviets would make every effort to avoid
                            trouble there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the situation
                            in Berlin did not stem from any action taken by the Soviets. The
                            President would recall that a meeting was scheduled in Berlin last fall
                            and the Secretary of State had discussed the problem with the
                            Ambassador, urging him to persuade his government to avoid any action in
                            connection with this meeting which might possibly result in
                            unpleasantness in and around Berlin. The Ambassador said he would not
                            wish his remarks to be recorded but he felt the President should know
                            that his Government had used its influence to insure that the situation
                            remained calm. There was no confrontation then, and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> saw no need for a
                            confrontation between us in the present situation.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that there would be no trouble in Berlin and he
                            welcomed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            assurances on this point. The <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0075"
                            />Soviets should understand that we are solidly behind the integrity of
                            West Berlin, and we will do whatever is necessary to protect it. He had
                            noted in the press references to the “provocative nature” of his visit
                            to Berlin. The President wished to assure Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that these stories were
                            totally without foundation and that his visit to Berlin was a perfectly
                            normal action for any United States President to take in connection with
                            a visit to Europe.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded the discussion by pointing out to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that the United States and the
                            Soviet Union have all the power necessary to maintain peace in the
                            world. If we play our role effectively, peace will be maintained. We do
                            ourselves and others disservice, however, if we pretend that we agree on
                            all the basic issues. We should rather insure that our differences do
                            not lead to confrontation, that we are not drawn into confrontation by
                            actions of others. We should recognize that diplomacy can play a vital
                            role in insuring that this does not happen.</p>

                        <p>The attention has been paid in Moscow to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s statements in which he set
                            forth his views on questions of peace and international cooperation.</p>
                        <p>As is known, the Soviet Union pursues and will pursue the policy of
                            peace. We are prepared to develop relations of peaceful cooperation with
                            all states which on their part strive for the same end, and we think
                            that if both the Soviet Union and the United States in their actions
                            proceed from exactly that principle basis, thereby there will be created
                            the widest opportunities for mutual agreement and Soviet-American
                            cooperation in solving the urgent international problems. We would like
                            to particularly stress here, that although the great powers <pb n="43"
                                xml:id="pg_43" facs="0076"/>bear special responsibility for
                            preserving peace, in their intentions and actions they—like all other
                            participants of international intercourse—must respect the inherent
                            rights of other states, big and small, for sovereign and independent
                            development, they must proceed from the real situation existing in the
                            world. If you agree with such understanding of major principles of our
                            relations, we on our part can fully subscribe to your statement to the
                            effect that “after a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of
                            negotiation”.</p>
                        <p>That is what we would like to say to the President right now in order to
                            exclude any misunderstanding on the American side of our approach to one
                            or another question.</p>
                        <p>We do not see any other principle basis on which the Soviet-American
                            relations could be built in the present world.</p>
                        <p>We are deeply convinced that if such approach be followed then despite
                            all differences of views, social and political systems and of state
                            interests there can be no such situation that would lead with fatal
                            inevitability to direct confrontation between our countries.</p>
                        <p>All this, of course, presumes a certain level of confidence and mutual
                            understanding that should also be present in searching ways to solving
                            urgent world problems. It implies, of course, not only formal agreements
                            but also opportunities provided by parallel or complementary actions
                            including those based on the principle of “mutual example” and so
                            on.</p>
                        <p>We are convinced that by their mutual efforts the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA together with other
                            states could achieve a situation when international negotiations would
                            serve first of all the purpose of preventing conflicts rather than
                            finding ways out of them after peace and international security had
                            already been endangered. It is of particular significance also because
                            there are a lot of temptations to set our countries against each other.
                            It may cause additional complicating elements in the process of
                            development of Soviet-American relations which is not simple even as it
                            is.</p>
                        <p>At present there has accumulated a number of big international problems
                            which are under discussion now, and the peoples have been waiting for a
                            long time for their solution in the interests of consolidation of
                            peace.</p>

                                    efforts should be made to have the Treaty on non-proliferation
                                    of nuclear weapons start effectively operating. This is a
                                    question of war and peace of the future. The Treaty that had
                                    been worked out to a considerable degree due to the joint
                                    efforts of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA
                                    has not been signed yet by a number of states and this,
                                    naturally, strengthens the positions of the opponents of the
                                    Treaty and casts doubts upon the possibility of solving the
                                    problem of non-proliferation. If, however, a number of nuclear
                                    states grow <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0077"/>the risk of
                                    new conflicts will increase with most dangerous consequences for
                                    universal peace.</p>
                                <p>In Moscow, there is readiness to continue consultations with the
                                    U.S. Government to work out coordinated measures on securing the
                                    signing of the Treaty by a maximum number of states and its
                                    earliest entering into force.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. It is believed in Moscow that the
                                    termination of the war in Vietnam providing the Vietnamese
                                    people with the opportunity to solve their internal affairs by
                                    themselves without any interference from outside will not only
                                    eliminate the most dangerous hotbed of war tension in the world,
                                    but also will serve as a convincing proof of a real possibility
                                    for settling even most acute and difficult problems. It is
                                    hardly doubtful that the political settlement of the Vietnam
                                    conflict on the basis of respect for legitimate national
                                    aspirations of the people of that country and the complete
                                    withdrawal of the American troops from the territory of Vietnam
                                    will affect in a most positive way the Soviet-American
                                    relations.</p>
                                <p>The Soviet Government welcomed the beginning of the Paris talks
                                    aimed at the political settlement of the Vietnam problem and it
                                    thinks that these talks should continue. We would like the talks
                                    to bring about positive results. This will be possible, of
                                    course, only if there is a realistic appraisal of the political
                                    forces acting in Vietnam and the recognition of their right for
                                    equal position in the negotiations. If the Paris negotiations
                                    develop in such a direction we shall render them all and every
                                    support.</p>

                                    tense and unsettled situation in the Middle East. We have
                                    already presented to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                        >Nixon</persName> our views on the causes of the situation

                                    only for the states of this area but far away outside it. The

                                    area with due regard for legitimate rights and interests of the
                                    Arab states—victims of aggression, put forward a concrete plan
                                    for the settlement there which fully corresponds to the spirit
                                    and content of the resolution unanimously adopted by the
                                    Security Council on November 22, 1967.<note n="2"

                                    about this plan.</p>
                                <p>We proceed from the necessity, on the one hand, that the Arab
                                    territories occupied by Israeli troops be liberated, and, on the
                                    other hand, that the existence of Israel as an independent state
                                    be guaranteed. If the government of Israel considers these
                                    principles unacceptable for the political settlement of the
                                    conflict then it means that Israel continues to follow
                                    aggressive and expansionist aims and remains on an adventurist
                                        <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0078"/>position. Neither
                                    Israel nor anyone else can have any reason to expect that the
                                    Arab countries and the states supporting them will agree with
                                    such Israeli policy.</p>
                                <p>We are confident that if the Soviet Union and the United States
                                    combining their efforts with the efforts of other states
                                    concerned make full use of their possibilities and influence in
                                    order to find just and lasting settlement in the Middle East it
                                    will also greatly contribute to the general relaxation of
                                    international tensions. We are ready for the exchange of views
                                    on the bilateral basis with the U.S. Government on the problems
                                    of the Middle East with the aim of achieving the necessary
                                    agreement on the settlement of the conflict. We said that
                                    before. But for some reasons not depending on the Soviet side
                                    such exchange of views didn't get due development. We also
                                    declare our readiness for the exchange of views on the problems
                                    of the Middle East among the four powers—permanent members of

                                    the following premise has a first-rate importance for the
                                    character and prospects of the relations between the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the USA: that is, whether
                                    both our countries are ready to proceed in their practical
                                    policies from the respect for the foundations of the post-war
                                    structure in Europe, formed as a result of the Second World War
                                    and the post-war development, and for the basic provisions,
                                    formulated by the Allied powers in the well-known Potsdam
                                    Agreements. There is no other way to peace in Europe but to take
                                    the reality into consideration and to prompt the others to do
                                    the same. It's impossible to regard the attempts to undermine
                                    the post-war structure in Europe otherwise than an encroachment
                                    on the vital interests of our country, of its friends and
                                    allies—the socialist countries.</p>
                                <p>At one time, and in particular in 1959–1963, when the Soviet and
                                    U.S. Governments were discussing the complex of German affairs,
                                    we were not far apart in understanding of that with regard to
                                    some important problems.<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">

                                <p>The Soviet Union regards with particular watchfulness certain
                                    aspects of the development of the F.R.G. and its policy not only
                                    because the past German invasion cost us many millions of human
                                    lives. President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                                    also understands very well that revanchism begins not when the
                                    frontier marks start falling down. That's the finale, the way to
                                    which is leading through the attempts to gain an access to the
                                    nuclear weapons, through the rehabilitation of the past, through
                                    the provocations similar to those which the F.R.G. commits from
                                    time to time with regard to West Berlin.</p>
                                <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0079"/>
                                <p>It became almost a rule that the F.R.G. stirs up outbursts of
                                    tensions around West Berlin, which didn't and doesn't belong to
                                    it, involving the Soviet Union, the USA and other countries into
                                    complications. It's hardly in anyone's interests to give the
                                    F.R.G. such a possibility. Anyhow the Soviet Union can't let the

                                <p>We would like the President to have complete clearness and
                                    confidence that the Soviet Union has no goals in Europe other
                                    than the establishment of the solid foundations of security in
                                    this part of the world, of the relations of détente between the

                                    the systems for delivering offensive strategic weapons and the
                                    defensive systems against ballistic missiles, and that the
                                    limitation and reduction of these arms should be balanced in
                                    such a way that neither side could obtain a military advantage
                                    and that the equal security for both sides be assured.</p>
                                <p>The Soviet Government confirms its readiness to continue the

                                    <hi rend="italic">Sixth</hi>. It would seem that broad and
                                    full-scale relations between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                        >USSR</gloss> and the USA in the field of international
                                    policy should be <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0080"
                                    />accompanied by an adequate scope of their bilateral relations.
                                    The mutually advantageous potentialities which exist in this
                                    area also speak for the development of connections and
                                    cooperation between our countries in most various fields, such
                                    as science, technology, economy, culture. The extent of the
                                    realization of these potentialities depends, of course, on the
                                    general political atmosphere in our relations.</p>
                                <p>If the U.S. Government is of the similar opinion then it could be
                                    possible to specifically look upon the opportunities existing
                                    now for the further development of the Soviet-American bilateral
                                    relations, to determine the succession of things to be done and
                                    to proceed with their implementation. As some of the examples,
                                    there could be mentioned possibilities for combined efforts in
                                    solving urgent problems of medicine, in space research in
                                    exploration and exploitation of the World ocean, in creation of
                                    the universal satellite communication system, etc.</p>
                                <p>As a whole, it is possible apparently to speak not only about
                                    usefulness but also about real feasibility of a constructive
                                    dialogue between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                    the USA on the wide range of questions. Indeed, it is in this
                                    sense that in Moscow there were taken President <persName

                                the President was clearly the considered view of the collective
                                leadership—not just <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>

                                press on with the missile talks. This may be because they are under
                                considerable pressure to assign more resources to the military if in
                                fact we go ahead with our <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                                program. They may hope by an early start of the missile talks to
                                delay decisions here and thus to cope with the pressures on them
                                from their own military.</item>

                            <item>It is obvious that the leadership was intrigued with the
                                President's reference to “negotiations, not confrontation” but is
                                uneasy as to the real meaning of linkage between arms control talks
                                and political issues. The Soviets may have suspected that the
                                President, by his reference to linkage, was reverting to the posture
                                of the early Eisenhower years when we attempted to condition
                                progress in arms control on the German issue. I think as a result of
                                the conversation today the Soviets now have a clearer understanding
                                as to the President's view—i.e., that progress on Viet Nam and on
                                the Middle East or lack of progress in these areas must inevitably
                                influence what is possible in the arms control field.</item>

                            <item>On Berlin, I think the President's remarks were useful in that
                                they conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> our
                                concern lest tough action by the East Germans result in a nasty
                                situation and a confrontation with us. I am <pb n="49"
                                    xml:id="pg_49" facs="0082"/>not sure, however, that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> understands clearly that a
                                blow-up in Berlin would seriously affect the outcome of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> as well as our own decision to
                                proceed with missile talks. Perhaps we should follow this up with a
                                further meeting in the Department, probably toward the end of the
                                President's tour when we may have a clear understanding as to the
                                action contemplated by the other side. My own view is that there
                                will not be serious problems around Berlin until the President
                                departs that city but that we can probably expect unpleasantness
                                immediately after his departure.</item>

                                    <item>The tone of the document is extraordinarily forthcoming.
                                        The Soviet approach is, as far as I can see, totally
                                        non-ideological—even anti-ideological. The arguments are
                                        posed strictly in terms of national interests and mutually
                                        perceived threats, without even the usual ritual obeisance
                                        to Marxist-Leninist jargon.</item>

                            <item>The gist of the paper is that the Soviets are prepared to move
                                forward on a whole range of topics: Middle East, Central Europe,
                                Vietnam, Arms Control (strategic arms talks), cultural exchange. In
                                other words, we have the “linkage.” Our problem is how to play

                            <item>The document is vague about specific proposals. However, the
                                following aspects deserve mention: <list>
                                    <item>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>. There is no reference to the
                                        usual Soviet claims of American aggression. They ask for
                                        “equal position” for all parties in the negotiating. We
                                        could probe what they mean.</item>
                                    <item>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi>. The document links
                                        Israeli withdrawal to a guaranteed existence for Israel.
                                        These are not posed as successive actions; rather they
                                        appear parts of a negotiated settlement, to be enforced by
                                        the sanctions of the Great Powers. Of course the Soviet
                                        statement leaves many loose ends, such as navigation rights
                                        in Suez, freedom of the Straits of Tiran, refugee problems,
                                        etc., but if one wishes to place the most generous possible
                                        construction on the Soviet statement, one could conclude
                                        that these points would follow agreement on the two basic
                                        tenets. Here, as in the case of Vietnam, there is great
                                        vagueness on specifics, but a positive tone of accommodation
                                        and mutual interest. It also offers specific
                                        negotiations.</item>

                                        statement comes close to offering a deal recognizing the

                                        expression of Soviet disinterest in further expansion in
                                        Europe and hope for détente. They add that we were close to
                                        agreement in 1959–63. We might probe what they have in

                                        security will be maintained.” As they have repeated often
                                        before, the Soviets here reiterate their readiness to sit
                                        down to talk as soon as we wish.</item>

                                <p>The question then is what the Soviets are up to. There are two
                                    schools of thought.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">The first</hi> is based on the notion that
                                    while the US-Soviet relationship is basically antagonistic and
                                    competitive, there are many areas where our interests overlap
                                    and where there is opportunity for at least tacit cooperation.
                                    The main common interest is in survival and, hence, in the
                                    prevention of war. This common interest, in turn, is held to
                                    make arms control a central issue in US-Soviet relations since
                                    the arms race is seen as a major source of potential conflict.
                                    Consequently, in this approach every effort should be made to
                                    engage the Soviets in negotiations wherever common interests
                                    occur, and especially on arms control. Moreover, every effort
                                    must be made to insulate these areas of common interests from
                                    those areas where our interests clash. It is argued, indeed,
                                    that arms control talks, even if they are not immediately
                                    successful, can serve as a firebreak to prevent confrontations
                                    from getting out of hand and spilling over into our whole
                                    relationship. It is fair to say that these are the principles on
                                    which the last Administration sought to operate, though it
                                    recognize, of course, there are limits beyond which a
                                    compartmentalization of our relations with the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> became infeasible and
                                    counter-productive. (The invasion of Czechoslovakia was one of
                                    the limiting points.)</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">A rather different approach</hi> is one that
                                    holds that an excessively selective policy runs into the danger
                                    that the Soviets will use the bait of progress in one area in
                                    order to neutralize our resistance to pressure elsewhere. It
                                    holds that precisely because we remain in an antagonistic
                                    relationship the erection of firebreaks may encourage the
                                    Soviets to be more adventurous. Moreover, in this view, there is
                                    an essential connection between crises and confrontations;
                                    unless there is progress on a fairly broad front to mitigate
                                    confrontations, there is little prospect of real reduction in
                                    tensions. This view also holds that arms per se rarely cause
                                    wars (at least as long as they are kept in relative balance) and
                                    that the arms control agreements that have been reached have had
                                    singularly little effect in reducing areas of conflict and
                                    confrontation.</p>
                                <p>My own view tends toward the latter approach, and I might add
                                    that the Soviets, with their Marxist training, have little
                                    difficulty in grasping its meaning—although they have become
                                    quite skilled in conducting a policy of selective tension and
                                    selective accommodation.</p>
                                <p>I believe the current Soviet line of conciliation and interest in
                                    negotiations, especially on arms control but also on the Middle
                                    East, stems <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0085"/>in large
                                    measure from their uncertainty about the plans of this
                                    Administration. They are clearly concerned that you may elect to
                                    undertake new weapons programs which would require new and
                                    costly decisions in Moscow; they hope that early negotiations
                                    would at least counteract such tendencies in Washington. (I
                                    doubt that there is much division on this point in the Kremlin,
                                    though there may well be substantial ones over the actual terms
                                    of an agreement with us.) In a nutshell, I think that at this
                                    moment of uncertainty about our intentions (the Soviets see it
                                    as a moment of contention between “reasonable” and “adventurous”
                                    forces here), Moscow wants to engage us. Some would argue that
                                    regardless of motive, we should not let this moment of Soviet
                                    interest pass, lest Moscow swing back to total hostility. My own
                                    view is that we should seek to utilize this Soviet interest,

                        <p>Despite our intensive efforts to analyze and understand Soviet behavior,
                            we are still far from a complete understanding of how major <pb n="53"
                                xml:id="pg_53" facs="0086"/>foreign policy decisions are made in the
                            Soviet Union or how our own behavior influences Soviet decisions.
                            Moreover, in seeking to characterize the nature of the Soviet-American
                            relationship, we are confronted with difficult problems of evaluating
                            our own, as well as Soviet, interests in various parts of the world.
                            Because of these uncertainties, a number of different views exist as to
                            the most appropriate way to characterize Soviet-American relations as a
                            guide to U.S. policy. There appear to be, however, three basic
                            alternative views of the Soviet-American relation.</p>

                                    no form of major accommodation with the Soviet Union is likely
                                    to be achievable. They believe that the Soviets are primarily
                                    interested in spreading their own influence and in undermining
                                    the influence and prestige of the United States.</p>

                                    proponents of this view. They would view measures such as the
                                    Non-Proliferation Treaty as a Soviet effort to split the
                                    alliance and as a move that weakens <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> flexibility in nuclear arrangements.
                                    Proponents of this view would urge other nations in the world to
                                    refrain from diplomatic relations and trade and aid
                                    relationships with the Soviet Union. They would urge American
                                    military assistance programs where necessary to prevent (or, at
                                    least, parallel and thereby hope to counterbalance) Soviet
                                    involvement, for example, in India and Pakistan or Nigeria.</p>
                                <p>Those who hold this position accept the fact that the United
                                    States and the Soviet Union share an overriding concern with
                                    preventing a nuclear war. Some of them argue that this interest
                                    is essentially self-regulated in that both sides pull back
                                    before a nuclear confrontation. Others hold that the Soviets use
                                    mutual fear to make us flinch in face of pressure. However, they
                                    do not believe that meaningful agreements even on nuclear
                                    matters can be based on this common interest. Specifically they
                                    are highly suspicious of efforts to negotiate arms control
                                    arguing that the Soviets will use arms control negotiations as a
                                    cover for their aggressive political behavior and use arms
                                    control agreements as a way of catching up to the United States
                                    or even lulling it into accepting inferiority.</p>

                                <p>Advocates of this position tend to emphasize common
                                    Soviet-American interests. They argue that despite Soviet
                                    rhetoric, ideology is no longer the basic motivating factor in
                                    Soviet external behavior and that both countries have an
                                    interest in maintaining the status quo in Central Europe. They
                                    believe that both have limited interests in the rest of the
                                    world, and emphasize the need to avoid a confrontation with each
                                    other.</p>
                                <p>Proponents of this view would emphasize efforts at
                                    Soviet-American accommodation. They would have pushed forward
                                    efforts at a Non-Proliferation Treaty with less regard than was
                                    shown for the concerns of our allies. They would seek to
                                    negotiate arrangements with the Russians in such areas as the
                                    Middle East and India and Pakistan even though such agreements
                                    might pave the way for increased Soviet involvement and
                                    influence in those areas.</p>
                                <p>While recognizing the need for a military deterrent against the
                                    Soviet Union, proponents of this view would urge a scaling down
                                    of our own efforts on the grounds that this could lead to Soviet
                                    reciprocation, and would not threaten our security.</p>
                                <p>In considering these two options, the Review Group believed that
                                    neither of them was an adequate basis for policy. The first
                                    option understates the possibilities for agreement with the
                                    Soviet Union and the extent to which there is a perception of at
                                    least certain limited common interests between the two
                                    countries. The Group, at the same time, felt that Soviet policy
                                    and behavior had not yet evolved—if it ever will—to the point
                                    that the second option could now be a basis for policy. Thus,
                                    the Group felt that the only realistic choice was a third
                                    option—which is essentially the one successive U.S.
                                    Administrations have taken—with the real differences of view
                                    arising within the scope of that approach. This middle option
                                    may be described as follows:</p>

                                </p>
                                <p>This view is based on the assumption that there will continue to
                                    be an underlying hostility between the United States and the
                                    Soviet Union. This hostility arises in part from the continuing
                                    Soviet commitment to an ideology which supports their wish to
                                    see the world evolve in a way radically different from our own
                                    preferences. The hostility also derives from clashes on
                                    political issues primarily involving clashes of interest in the
                                    Middle East and elsewhere.</p>
                                <p>At the same time there are elements of shared concerns which make
                                    possible certain kinds of accommodation. The dominant common
                                    interests is in avoiding a nuclear war. This requires active
                                    Soviet-American collaboration to damp down potentially explosive
                                    situations <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0088"/>in the Middle
                                    East, in the Indian sub-continent and elsewhere. Reduction of
                                    the likelihood of a nuclear clash would also be enhanced by arms
                                    control arrangements seeking to limit and then reduce strategic
                                    forces on both sides.</p>
                                <p>Proponents of this view agree that a strong U.S. nuclear
                                    deterrent and a continuing strong <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                        >NATO</gloss> are necessary in order not to tempt the
                                    Soviets into military or diplomatic adventures.</p>

                                    as partly competitive and partly cooperative. In some cases,
                                    such as most of Africa, both Soviet and American interests are
                                    sufficiently modest that neither we nor they are fundamentally
                                    concerned about the role of the other. In other cases, as in the
                                    Middle East, we have competing interests, but these are mixed
                                    with a common desire not to permit others to drag us into a
                                    direct confrontation.</p>
                                <p>The Review Group noted that while there appears to be a consensus
                                    among officials working on Soviet-American problems on this
                                    broad view of U.S.-Soviet relations, there is a wide spectrum of
                                    differences both about specific issues and about general policy
                                    lines. Although views fall across the entire spectrum, it is
                                    possible to characterize two distinct policy emphases consistent
                                    with the limited adversary perspective of the U.S.-Soviet
                                    relationship.</p>

                                <p>They would argue that negotiation of a strategic arms control
                                    agreement with the Soviet Union is sufficiently important that a
                                    major effort should be made to insulate the search for such an
                                    agreement from other political issues, while acknowledging that
                                    major Soviet threats and acts of aggression such as the invasion
                                    of Czechoslovakia create a climate in which strategic talks
                                    could not go forward. They would argue that the current climate
                                    in which we are talking to the Russians about the Middle East
                                    and in which they appear to be cooperative about seeking a
                                    Vietnam settlement is a sufficient basis for proceeding with
                                    talks.</p>
                                <p>With regard to possible conflict between allied concerns and
                                    negotiations with the Soviet, advocates of this position would
                                    argue that although we would consult with our allies, we should
                                    not permit them to have a veto on our actions provided we
                                    ourselves are convinced they are consistent with allied
                                    interests. The U.S. posture during the Non-Proliferation Treaty
                                    negotiations, in essence, followed the pattern recommended by
                                    this Group in contrast to others who argued that we did not pay
                                    sufficient attention to allied concerns.</p>

                                <p>Those who take this approach view the third world as an area for
                                    substantially greater Soviet-American cooperation than has been
                                    the case. They would emphasize the virtual absence of vital
                                    Soviet or American interests in most, if not all, of the third
                                    world. According to this approach no effort would be made to
                                    discourage other countries from increasing their contacts, both
                                    political and economic, with the Soviets since such contacts
                                    would be viewed as largely inevitable and in many cases as
                                    potentially helpful. In the Middle East, for example, an effort
                                    would be made to work out a Soviet-American understanding even
                                    if this involved pressure by each on its allies and even if it
                                    appeared to sanction a major Soviet role in the area.</p>
                                <p>U.S. relations with Eastern Europe and with China would at least
                                    to some degree be subordinated to concerns about Soviet
                                    reaction. Thus, we would not seek to frighten the Soviets with
                                    the prospect of a Chinese-American rapprochement and would
                                    counsel our allies to be sensitive to Soviet concerns in their
                                    dealing with Eastern Europe.</p>

                                <p>Advocates of this view would emphasize the continuing areas of
                                    hostility with the Soviets and the need to take these fully into
                                    account in designing possible measures of accommodation.</p>
                                <p>Following this approach we would insist upon greater progress in
                                    political areas before being prepared to move ahead with
                                    strategic talks and we would not proceed with such talks until
                                    our allies have been fully consulted and had given their
                                    agreement to proceeding even if this procedure should impose
                                    substantial delays.</p>
                                <p>Efforts to improve relations with the Soviet Union in general
                                    would proceed only after full allied consultation. We would be
                                    concerned not only with our perception of allied interests but
                                    their own perception of these interests as well. For example,
                                    proponents of this position would have taken much greater
                                    account of the German argument that the Non-Proliferation Treaty
                                    was essentially a Soviet effort aimed at obtaining concessions
                                    from Germany without reciprocal Soviet concessions to the
                                    Federal Republic.</p>
                                <p>In the third world this approach would emphasize continuing
                                    competition while not excluding areas of possible accommodation.
                                    Thus, in many areas of the world we would urge governments to
                                    reduce or at least not expand their contacts with the Soviets
                                    and warn against the dangers of accepting Soviet aid. Without
                                    ruling out joint efforts to damp down areas such as the Middle
                                    East we would keep conflicting Soviet-American interests in the
                                    area very much in mind and perhaps make an effort to devise
                                    settlements which reduce Soviet influence.</p>

                                    merits, with secondary consideration to the possibility that we
                                    would antagonize the Soviet Union. We might introduce deliberate
                                    ambiguity in our policies designed to increase Soviet
                                    apprehensions.</p>

                            as well as specific policy issues. The Review Group felt that

                                <p>The essential argument here is whether or not progress on

                                    their sense of concern by raising the possibility that we will
                                    act in ways contrary to their interests unless they come to some
                                    agreement with us. The dispute arises in part from our imperfect

                                        <item>The Soviets are likely to make concessions only if
                                            they are confronted with alternatives which they
                                            perceive to be considerably worse.</item>

                                <p>This general issue arises in a number of specific forms. For
                                    example, some argue that Soviet cooperation on Far East matters,
                                    including Vietnam, depends on convincing the Russians that we
                                    are not seeking to a deal behind their backs with the Chinese.
                                    It is suggested that the Russians' primary concern is limiting
                                    Chinese influence in the area and that they are reluctant to
                                    deal with us as they fear that we may expose our contacts with
                                    them in an effort to seek an understanding with the Chinese.
                                    Others argue that only the fear of a Chinese-American
                                    rapprochement will lead the Russians to be cooperative in the
                                    Far East. European policy encounters the same difference of
                                    opinion. Will progress come from assuring the Russians that we
                                    have no inimical designs on Eastern Europe, or will it come from
                                    U.S. support of tendencies toward autonomy and liberalization in
                                    Eastern Europe? Another area where this general issue arises is
                                    arms negotiations. For example, should we proceed with
                                    deployment of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system as a
                                    bargaining counter in order to induce the Soviets to negotiate
                                    in earnest? Or should we reassure the Soviets by holding up
                                    deployment?</p>

                                                <item>There is a significant possibility of
                                                  negotiating an arms control agreement which both
                                                  reduces the likelihood of general war and freezes
                                                  the current relative strategic force postures.
                                                  Because the Soviets believe that they will have to
                                                  spend very large sums to prevent us from

                                                  accept a freeze. These two objectives—reducing the

                                                  This was the policy of the previous administration
                                                  in declining to go forward with the talks after

                                                  matters and that we would sign agreements only if

                                                  the Middle East were sufficient to justify

                            <p>(All the leaders you are meeting are interested in your view of
                                East-West relations and in your plans for dealing with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Several have asked about our
                                “conception.” Europeans have conflicting worries: on the one hand
                                they fear our dealing with the Soviets behind their backs
                                (“condominium”); on the other, they worry that we might <pb n="65"
                                    xml:id="pg_65" facs="0098"/>draw them into excessive risks and
                                load on them responsibilities that they are not prepared to carry.
                                Lately, they have wondered about the significance and implications
                                of your public statements connecting missile talks with progress on
                                other issues. Among some, who sense a big US push for
                                across-the-board settlements with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>, these statements have raised the condominium
                                spectre. The Europeans also want to know how we propose to consult
                                with them on East-West matters generally, and on missile talks
                                particularly. The French, especially, would like to engage in
                                bilateral consultations rather than through <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss>. The others want to consult through <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> but maintain bilateral channels
                                as well. None of them want us to make formal proposals to the
                                Soviets on arms control without having been consulted. The Germans
                                and, to a lesser degree, the Italians have painful memories of the
                                early <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> negotiations in which they
                                feel, justifiably, that they were confronted with a fait

                                    high-level or other official conferences with the Soviets should
                                    be well prepared in advance and should offer promise of concrete

                                <item>We think the allies should attempt to concert their approaches
                                    as much as possible; Soviet incentive to negotiate seriously is
                                    reduced if they think they can maneuver among the allies and
                                    divide them.</item>

                                <item>In negotiating we want to proceed on a basis of a sense of
                                    military security. I have used the word “sufficiency”: in its
                                    broadest sense, this means forces that are strong and varied
                                    enough to deter not only Soviet attack but also gross pressures
                                    which the Soviets might be tempted to try if they calculated
                                    that confidence in our capabilities and resolve was eroding. But
                                    neither in what we say nor what we do, would we want to force
                                    the pace of armaments.</item>

                                    balance—but from clashing interests, ambitions, and purposes.
                                    For this reason I am skeptical about singling out arms as an
                                    exclusive subject for negotiation.</item>

                                    the Soviets have tended to use the bait of arms talks, or actual
                                    talks, as a means of regulating crises they themselves created.
                                    (Examples: abortive disarmament talks after Hungary, early

                                <item>In addition, the problem of strategic weapons goes to the core
                                    of the security of ourselves and our allies (and, for that
                                    matter of the Soviets); it cannot therefore be isolated from the
                                    other great issues that impinge on security and peace.</item>
                                <label>E.</label>
                                <item>We are not establishing rigid linkages between arms control
                                    and other issues. But we do believe that there has to be
                                    progress in coping with the volatile issues (notably the Middle
                                    East and Vietnam) before one can get very far on strategic
                                    weapons. We recognize that the Soviets are not controlling
                                    factors in these situations; but they do have influence and we
                                    know that at various times that influence has been exerted in
                                    directions away from, rather than toward, settlements. If that
                                    were to happen again it would not be compatible with progress on

                                <item>We have said that we are entering an era of negotiation. We
                                    see this as a complex and extended process and recognize that
                                    there will remain substantial elements of confrontation.</item>

                                <item>By negotiation, we mean a serious engagement of the issues,
                                    not simply meetings for meetings' sake. In general, we believe
                                    that high-level or other official conferences with the Soviets
                                    should be well prepared in advance and should offer promise of

                                <item>We think the allies should attempt to concert their approaches
                                    as much as possible; Soviet incentive to negotiate seriously is
                                    reduced if they think that they can maneuver among the allies
                                    and divide them.</item>

                                <item>In negotiating, we want to proceed on a basis of sense of
                                    military security. We have used the word “sufficiency” in its
                                    broadest sense; this means forces that are strong and varied
                                    enough to deter not only Soviet attack but also gross pressures
                                    which the Soviets might be tempted to try if they calculated
                                    that confidence in our capabilities and resolve was eroding. But
                                    neither in what we say nor what we do, would we want to force
                                    the pace of armaments.</item>

                                <item>Wars and crises generally result not from the level of
                                    arms—not, at least, when these levels are in relative
                                    balance—but from clashing interests, ambitions, and purposes.
                                    For this reason, we are skeptical about singling out arms as an

                                    the Soviets have tended to use the bait of arms talks, or actual
                                    talks, as a means of regulating crises they themselves created.

                                    from, rather than toward, settlements. If that were to happen
                                    again, it would not be compatible with progress on arms

                            we will consult on subjects that plainly affect the interests of other
                            governments because we wish to give full weight to the points of view of
                            other governments concerned. On major issues, we will make no proposal
                            to the Soviets unless we have first discussed them with allies,
                            especially those having direct concern. Consultations will be maintained

                            regarding means and forum for consultations. We assume that the allies
                            will take a similar approach to consultation in connection with their

                        <p rend="center">Note</p>
                        <p>This paper considers in broad perspective the principal factors which
                            underlie the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s external policies
                            at present and its aims and intentions with respect to certain key areas
                            and issues. As such, while it suggests the limits within which Soviet
                            policies are likely to operate, it does not estimate likely Soviet
                            conduct and positions in detail. In view of the intimate interaction
                            between Soviet and American policies, this could not be done in any case
                            without specific assumptions about American policy and actions.</p>

                            <item>Ideology in the Soviet Union is in a certain sense dead, yet it
                                still plays a vital role. This paradox explains much about the
                                nature of Soviet society and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> as a world power today. While the regime's
                                doctrines now inhibit rather than promote needed change in the
                                system, the leaders continue to guard them as an essential support
                                to their rule. They also view developments at home and abroad mainly
                                within the conceptual framework of the traditional ideology. This
                                fact will continue to limit the possibilities of Soviet-American
                                dialogue.</item>

                            <item>Changes in the system and the society have probably made
                                collective leadership of the Party Politburo less vulnerable to new
                                attempts to establish a personal dictatorship. This seems
                                particularly true so long as the men who now comprise the leadership
                                remain. Nevertheless, a crisis within the present leadership,
                                accompanied by high domestic tensions and greater unpredictability
                                of external policy, could occur at any time without warning. If
                                stability of the leadership continues, a relatively deliberate,
                                bureaucratically compromised manner of decisionmaking will also
                                continue.</item>

                            <item>The Soviet leaders face severe problems at home. A decline in the
                                rate of economic growth is tightening the perennial squeeze on
                                resource allocation. Dissidence and alienation in the professional
                                classes is of growing concern to the Soviet leaders. Generally
                                speaking, however, they are not at this time constrained by domestic
                                problems from continuing the general line of foreign policy they
                                have followed in recent years.</item>

                                both military and political factors, has improved in the years since
                                the Cuban missile crisis. But this is qualified by instability in
                                its main security sphere in Eastern Europe and by increased strains
                                in the Soviet economy and society. This appraisal by the Soviet
                                leaders probably argues for continuing an external policy of
                                cautious opportunism and limited pressures, perhaps with some
                                increased watchfulness against the development of uncontrolled

                                world revolutionary movement. This is evident in the concentration
                                of diplomatic and aid efforts in recent years on countries around

                                guidance given to most Communist parties to pursue moderate tactics,
                                which are now more compatible with Soviet foreign policy

                                course. For the present, the Soviets are unlikely to be responsive
                                to any new Western initiatives to promote a European settlement,
                                unless the West seems willing to contemplate recognition of the

                                threatening its survival. At that stage, the Soviets would probably

                                Western colonialism, Soviet policy in Asia in recent years has been
                                geared increasingly to the containment of China. Nevertheless, the

                                basically on the premise that the Soviet-American relationship in

                                no agreement is reached, will ease the pressures of the arms race by

                                is now poorly suited to managing a complex industrial society, its
                                rulers remain tenacious in defending their monopoly of power and
                                acutely fearful of adaptive change. The wider involvement of the

                                most of the Soviet population, is cynically manipulated by the

                                major factor, however, because in the main it continues to provide
                                the conceptual framework within which Soviet internal and external
                                policies are formulated. It is the semantical prism through which
                                the Soviet leaders view the problems and development of their own
                                system. More important, it conditions profoundly the way in which
                                they interpret the aims and conduct of non-Communist societies. With
                                respect to the US, in particular, it underlies the fearful and
                                hostile “set” of Soviet attitudes which so greatly limits the

                            <item>Some observers have thought at various times that all this was
                                changing, that doctrinal politics was giving way inevitably to
                                pragmatic politics. Such opinions have proved premature. The basic
                                and often overlooked reason is that ideology performs a vital
                                political function in the Soviet system: it serves as the regime's
                                badge of legitimacy. Without the claim that it was the embodiment of
                                a historically predestined process of revolutionary social advance,
                                all the crimes and deprivations which this regime has inflicted on a
                                long-suffering people might not have been borne. Force alone,
                                without buttressing from doctrinal rationalizations which claimed
                                high moral purpose, probably would not have been enough to give the
                                Soviet regime the authority it needed. From the beginning, moreover,
                                ideological rigor has been used as a weapon to preserve the unity of
                                a fractious Party and to suppress nonconforming elements inside and
                                outside it. In Russian conditions and against the background of
                                Russian history, ideology has proved to be an important tool in
                                making effective the rule by force and repression of the small
                                political sect which seized power in 1917 and has held it by
                                tyrannical methods since.</item>

                            <item>Today the Soviet leadership remains as sensitive as ever to any
                                hint of challenge to its ideological pretensions. In fact, during
                                the last several years it has grown more rigid and conservative in
                                this respect. The reasons for this are complex. They begin simply
                                with the temperament of the bureaucratic collective which now
                                governs. Then, social change has produced a larger educated class
                                and in particular a technical elite which is less disposed to think
                                ideologically or to accept ritualistic formulas of the old kind.
                                Further, the ideological as well as political authority of the
                                Soviet leadership has been sharply challenged by the
                                nationalist-inspired deviations which have appeared in China and
                                Eastern Europe since Stalin's death. Finally, the effort to isolate
                                the population and also Party members from alien influences, on
                                which the preservation of the regime's ideological authority
                                depends, has grown more difficult; there has been increased exposure
                                to the outside world in a number of ways, partly as a consequence of
                                the development of communications.</item>

                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> feel themselves on the
                                ideological defensive. They believe that if they retreat on this
                                front the whole structure of their power will crumble. This concern
                                lies behind their intensified repression of dissidents in recent
                                years and their cautious restoration of Stalin's reputation; it
                                figured strongly in their use of force against the Czechoslovak
                                reform movement. Short of the appearance of new leadership, and
                                possibly not then, this mood of fearful conservatism is unlikely to
                                change. It will affect adversely the tone of Soviet-American
                                relations and thus the possibilities of the more constructive
                                dialogue which must be the prelude to any significant improvement in
                                those relations.</item>

                                students of the Soviet system, collective leadership—the sharing of
                                power by a dozen or so top leaders in the Politburo, the Party's
                                supreme executive organ—has endured since the fall of Khrushchev in
                                October 1964. While collectivity has always been the declared
                                principle on which the system was supposed to operate, the
                                dictatorship of one man has been the rule during much of the Soviet
                                history. Some have concluded that the failure of Khrushchev to
                                consolidate himself in such a role and the evident fact that

                            <item>Persuasive considerations argue for this view. The dynamics of
                                other revolutions suggest that the heroic figures of the first
                                generation give way to men of more limited capacity whose temper is
                                more bureaucratic. The men who now comprise the top echelon, who
                                have spent their entire lives in the apparatus, appear to be of this
                                stripe. Moreover, the enormous growth of state and economic
                                institutions, and the far greater complexity of the issues posed as
                                Soviet society has developed, make the simplistic methods of an
                                earlier time inapplicable. Collective, i.e., bureaucratic,
                                decisionmaking seems the normal mode in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                            <item>Yet tensions arising from the attempt of individual leaders to
                                enlarge their power are evident from time to time, and it cannot be
                                doubted that the classic form of power struggle seen in the past
                                persists behind the façade of collectivity. The system remains one
                                of men and not of laws. Therefore, it is impossible to rule out new
                                attempts by individual leaders to establish themselves in the role
                                of dictator, together with the arbitrary measures, increased social
                                tensions, and unpredictability of policy which would inevitably
                                accompany such attempts. At a minimum, there will be leaders who
                                will strive to establish ascendancy over their colleagues, and thus,
                                as Khrushchev appeared likely to do for a time, to reduce
                                collectivity in effect to a mere form.</item>

                            <item>If such developments were to occur, they would probably result
                                from some major setback at home or abroad, from a deadlock over some
                                vital issue of policy whose resolution was urgent, or simply from an
                                accumulation of unsolved problems. A new personal dictatorship would
                                require the emergence of some commanding personality clearly
                                superior to his colleagues in the skills of the power game, though
                                the appearance of a man of such dimensions is entirely a matter of
                                chance. On the whole, while it is not at all implausible to believe
                                that attempts to displace collective leadership will be made, it
                                appears unlikely that such attempts will be successful in the
                                conditions that now obtain in the political system and the society.
                                This seems particularly true so long as the men who now comprise the
                                leadership remain.</item>

                            <item>A breakdown in the apparent stability of the present collective,
                                even short of an attempt by one man to displace or dominate it, is
                                always possible, however. The result might be a change in the
                                composition of the leadership and a shift of direction on some major
                                aspect of policy. It is impossible to say what circumstances might
                                precipitate such a development or to predict the event itself. The
                                principal members of the Politburo are old enough to be subject to
                                sudden health hazards; sooner or later the need to coopt new members
                                might unhinge the delicate balance of power within that group.
                                Domestic issues which are always key ones and are now serious,
                                combined with the kind of contentious problems now being encountered
                                by Soviet policy abroad, most conspicuously the setback in
                                Czechoslovakia, could bring a leadership crisis at any time.</item>

                            <item>This threat of instability overhanging the top leadership does not
                                arise from a mere constitutional imbalance, like the weakness of the
                                executive under the Fourth Republic in France, and the consequent
                                instability of cabinets. It is due, despite the existence of a
                                constitution on paper, to the disregard of constitutional restraints
                                which could confer legitimacy on the system and its procedures. Thus
                                the matter of succession to leadership has been on each occasion a
                                struggle for raw power as in a gang. Similarly, the role of the
                                Party in relation to society and its institutions, including
                                government organs, is an arbitrary one, uncontrolled by law. The
                                Party purports to be merely an instrument for political inspiration
                                and guidance, but in fact Party men under direction from the top
                                exercise a power of intervention at all levels and in every
                                institution. The result is a sense throughout the society that power
                                is wielded arbitrarily and unjustly. In this atmosphere, individuals
                                withhold their voluntary cooperation and the ability of authority to
                                deal efficiently with many problems is reduced.</item>

                                get made or that policy is wholly without initiative. It does mean
                                that significant moves are likely to come under the pressure of
                                events, and normally will be less sweeping or erratic than they were

                                Soviet leadership at present are severe. One of the major ones is
                                the perennial dilemma of all modern governments: how to allocate
                                inadequate resources among the primary goals of policy—military
                                strength and security, economic development and growth, consumption
                                and welfare. The Soviet system continues to be able to apply
                                proportionately greater resources to public purposes than
                                non-Communist industrial states can. But it is trying to sustain a
                                world power competition with the US on an economic base half that of
                                the US. While this has been managed by <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75"

                            <item>Both a reflection and a source of increasing strain has been a
                                decline in the economy's rate of growth. This decline was owing to a
                                combination of factors: with growing technological complexity,
                                growth rates per unit of investment have fallen off, particularly in
                                industry; the resources drain of major military and space programs
                                in this decade has been substantial; concessions to popular demands
                                for material improvement, especially in food and housing, were
                                thought necessary. The result has been a slow decline in the rate of
                                growth of investment in industry. This, along with the drop in
                                productivity of investment, has led to a significant decline in the
                                rate of growth in industrial output.</item>

                            <item>The response of the Soviet leaders has been to introduce economic
                                reforms aimed at raising the still low levels of productivity in
                                industry and agriculture. The program laid down in 1965 and still
                                being implemented seeks to do this by providing greater autonomy and
                                incentives for enterprises. The measures were not only partial but
                                were largely frustrated in practice and the gains so far have been
                                insignificant. While much more radical departures, amounting in
                                effect to a change in the nature of the system, would be necessary
                                to get results, the resistance of the Party and the vast state
                                bureaucracy precludes change of this magnitude. Moreover, the Soviet
                                leaders fear, as was demonstrated most recently in Czechoslovakia,
                                that moves to free the economy from central control give rise
                                rapidly to demands for freedom in every aspect of society, including
                                politics. This they seem less ready than ever to face, and so their
                                economic dilemmas will remain and sharpen.</item>

                            <item>Social strains have led the leaders to give steady attention and
                                increased resources to meeting expectations for an improved level of
                                life, even at the cost of investment in other sectors traditionally
                                of high priority. Thus a multiplicity of goals makes decisions
                                harder, especially under collective leadership; perhaps there has
                                also been some loss of will and ruthlessness on the part of the
                                ruling elite. Yet the leadership does not appear to regard the
                                material discontents of the masses as an actual threat, and it is
                                probably right in this.</item>

                                years of manifestations of dissidence among intellectuals. It is

                                seems clear. What the regime fears is the erosion of respect for its
                                authority among leading elements of the society which might, in
                                certain unforeseeable circumstances, combine with and activate the
                                chronic discontents of the masses to produce a genuine challenge.
                                While no such challenge seems imminent, occupants of the Kremlin
                                probably always remind themselves that in Russia anarchy has usually
                                lurked close beneath the surface of tyranny. In any case, barring a
                                change of leaders, the outlook is for a careful but steady
                                repression of liberalizing forces, and a continuing effort to wall
                                out external sources of infection.</item>

                            <item>A threat to the political leadership stemming from the military
                                establishment is sometimes predicted by Western analysts. Clearly
                                the military leaders do have larger influence on decisions, partly
                                because the leadership is a collective. Their role has also
                                increased because the resources given to defense since World War II
                                have grown greatly, and because decisions affecting defense are now
                                more technically complex. Even though some military leaders might
                                try to influence the outcome of a leadership crisis, the increased
                                bureaucratic weight the military now enjoy is unlikely to persuade
                                them that they could replace the Party in running the country.
                                Probably most military men believe that the attempt would nowadays
                                involve grave risks to national security. Should the Party regime be
                                seriously weakened or collapse, however, the military leadership
                                probably would intervene, but in such circumstances they would be
                                acting primarily out of concern for national security. Such a
                                development now seems remote.</item>

                                states, there is a linkage in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> between internal and external policies. Since
                                preoccupation with the regime's security at home is high, risks
                                abroad are normally weighed carefully. It is worth noting, however,
                                that in the years of Khrushchev's real ascendancy (1957–1962), when
                                internal tensions were reduced and confidence in the domestic
                                outlook was generally rising, there was a tendency toward more
                                assertiveness and risktaking abroad, though this was obviously due
                                also to Khrushchev's own temperament.</item>

                            <item>The present leaders are evidently aware that successes on the
                                international scene can help to ease internal stresses and that
                                setbacks abroad are dangerous to them at home. While they are not
                                inclined, therefore, to be adventurous in foreign policy, they have
                                shown a will to advance opportunistically under conditions of
                                controlled risk, with <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0110"/>a
                                preference for moving into vacuums rather than for direct
                                confrontations. The exception to this generally deliberate approach
                                is their own security zone in Eastern Europe where, as in
                                Czechoslovakia last summer, after some hesitation, they finally
                                moved with brutal assertiveness. This action was primarily
                                defensive, however, and the leading motive for it was precisely a
                                fear for the eventual security of the Soviet regime itself.</item>

                            <item>Generally speaking, the present leadership conducts its foreign
                                policies in such a manner as to impose no special handicaps on
                                itself internally, and the domestic problems described above do not
                                now prevent it from doing abroad what it wants to do. Apart from
                                occasional grumbling over foreign aid expenditures, which are not in
                                fact very heavy, on the whole the policies which have brought
                                greater Soviet influence abroad, for example in the Middle East and
                                South Asia, are probably a plus for the regime. But whenever Soviet
                                policies encounter setbacks, and especially if they appear to
                                heighten risks of war, as in the Arab-Israeli conflict of June 1967,
                                stresses on the home front are sharply increased. This is one of the
                                major reasons for a foreign policy of limited risks.</item>

                                “the relation of forces”—is characteristic of the Soviet leaders.
                                This springs from Marxism-Leninism itself, which is a doctrine
                                concerned primarily with the analysis of power relations in society
                                and the techniques for manipulating them. It also reflects the long
                                years of “encirclement” when the Soviet leaders constantly perceived
                                external threats aimed at the very existence of their regime.</item>

                            <item>In calculating power relationships the Soviets weigh a variety of
                                factors. They give great weight to military power, perhaps as much
                                for its political-psychological effects, i.e., its support to
                                political warfare, as for its direct utility. In measuring the
                                strength of other states, they also attach great importance to
                                economic trends, to the degree of internal unity or division, and to
                                the capacities of leaders and their will to confront risks. They are
                                sensitive to the ebb and flow of opinion in other countries, not for
                                reasons of sentiment, but because it may register shifts of attitude
                                toward power relations and can thus actually affect those
                                relations.</item>

                                crisis in 1962. Nevertheless, not everything has come up roses. They
                                have substantially bettered their relative strength in strategic
                                weapons, and have acquired conventional capabilities which, in
                                certain areas beyond the Bloc periphery, would permit them to
                                intervene in a limited way. But in strategic weapons the US is now

                                economic burdens—if the Soviets wish to keep pace. Meanwhile, the US
                                has sustained improved rates of economic growth for some years as
                                Soviet growth has declined, and visions of “overtaking and
                                surpassing” have vanished, even from propaganda. On the positive
                                side, the world influence of the US has suffered because of Vietnam,
                                its alliances have been strained, and it has been wracked by
                                internal discords at a time when Soviet influence and presence in

                                feel that they can allow themselves no more than a measured

                                viewed from Moscow at present, results in a conclusion that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is overextended and must
                                retrench. On balance, it probably argues for continuing policies of

                                risks. The Soviet leaders feel able to assert, moreover, as they

                                geopolitical considerations, of the sort normal in any great power.
                                This is seen most notably in the concentration of diplomatic and aid

                                influence rather than to overthrow non-Communist governments.
                                Compared with the 1950's, the outlook for Communist revolutionary

                                are clearly reduced from what they were at the beginning of the
                                1960's. The troubled relationship with “socialist” Cuba and several
                                disappointments in Africa and Asia have presumably brought about
                                this change. Castro is probably carried today as a somewhat painful
                                legacy of a more innocent phase, before the Soviets discovered their
                                error in coopting as reliable Communists the often vigorous but
                                “ideologically weak” revolutionaries they encounter in less
                                developed countries.</item>

                                ambitious power concerned to enlarge its world position. They do
                                suggest that in practice the Soviets place somewhat less emphasis on
                                their pretensions to be a revolutionary power with a universal
                                mission. They are inclined to set priorities for their efforts in
                                various areas in accordance with a more traditional view of Russian
                                security interests and also with a more realistic view of the
                                possibilities for expanding their influence. This does not ease US

                                opponent. And, because the Soviet leaders are committed to a

                                Soviets have always been clear that their security and their
                                aspirations to a world role rest in the first instance on their
                                position in Europe. This is based on holding Eastern Europe as an
                                ideological and security buffer, and they have worked doggedly to
                                consolidate, and to get international recognition for their hegemony
                                there. With that went the long campaign to win final acceptance from
                                the Western Powers of the division of Germany and the persistent
                                effort to isolate and contain the Federal Republic, the revival of
                                whose economic and political influence, the Soviets believe, would
                                undermine their control of Eastern Europe. That nothing in this

                                clue to long-range Soviet hopes for the area, had emerged in
                                1966–1967. Taking advantage of US involvement in Vietnam and the
                                consequent strains in US relations with Europe, of de Gaulle's
                                withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and of
                                desires for détente in Western Europe, the Soviets tried to promote
                                moves toward a European settlement without the US. At the time, they
                                probably had in mind no more than a preliminary probe to stimulate
                                West European interest in such an approach. But the outcome they
                                look for eventually was made clear: dissolution of <gloss

                            <item>When the Soviets, with their arms sales to Egypt in 1955, moved
                                into the vacuum left in the Middle East by the collapse of the
                                Western colonial system, they almost certainly did not anticipate
                                the kind of situation in which they are now so heavily involved.
                                Their aims were to diminish the Western presence, to increase
                                strains in the Western Alliance, and ultimately to establish
                                themselves as the pre-eminent power in the region. They hoped to do
                                these things by developing the natural alliance they saw between
                                themselves and “the progressive forces of national liberation,”
                                which they also imagined could be led under Soviet influence to take
                                the “socialist road.” They had no very profound understanding of the

                                great influence and a military presence in an area they clearly
                                regard as of strategic importance to them, but it has also brought
                                risks and burdens.</item>

                                risks and at the same time to avoid any undue prejudice to its
                                influence with the Arabs. Even if it were possible for
                                Soviet-Western collaboration to impose a stable settlement, the
                                Soviets would probably believe that their influence with the Arabs
                                would suffer, since it has been built largely on implicit support of
                                radical Arab hostility to Israel. The more recent Soviet moves for
                                diplomatic collaboration with the Western Powers probably reflect
                                concern that eventually the risks could become less controllable,
                                especially because of the increasing role of Arab terrorist
                                organizations which the Arab States themselves cannot control.
                                Soviet tactics evidently aim now at persuading the US to influence
                                Israel toward moderating its claims sufficiently to permit
                                diplomatic processes to work and some defusing of tensions to occur.
                                But the Soviet leaders do seem to recognize that some pressure on
                                their own clients, which could damage the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>'s standing with the Arabs, will also be needed.
                                Perhaps awareness of the possibility of Israel's early acquisition
                                of nuclear weapons gives the Soviets an added incentive to try to
                                move the Arabs toward a reduction of tensions.</item>

                                expect to gain certain advantages. Opening of the Suez Canal would
                                shorten their shipping route to Asia and would facilitate Soviet
                                maritime operations in the Indian Ocean. Their part in bringing
                                about a settlement might constitute implicit acceptance by the
                                Western Powers of their right to a decisive voice in the affairs of
                                the area. But to achieve a general settlement, the Soviets would
                                have to bring such great pressure to bear on the Arabs to make
                                concessions that they would risk losing the position of influence

                                present diplomatic activity is probably undertaken only with a view
                                to containing the risks in the present situation rather than in any

                                Soviet ships and aircraft are present intermittently at UAR bases
                                and large numbers of Soviet advisors serve with Egyptian combat
                                units. But the Soviets would not want to run the political and

                                has also been intended to serve aims of policy. The Soviet leaders
                                have wanted to see a setback for US power in Vietnam which would
                                limit the future US role in Asia. But they also wanted this to be
                                achieved by tactics which would limit political and military risks
                                to themselves and maximize their own rather than Chinese credit for
                                the success. <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0116"/>Thus, though
                                they have had only modest leverage in Hanoi, they have evidently
                                used it, not toward ending the war, but to influence the Vietnamese
                                to rely more on the political element in their mix of
                                political-military tactics. The Soviets brought propaganda and
                                diplomatic pressure to bear on the US in order to promote
                                negotiations under conditions Hanoi would accept. Now that
                                negotiations are in train, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                will want to help them succeed, but not in ways which would
                                prejudice its future relations with Hanoi. If the North Vietnamese
                                accede to a settlement short of their original aims, however, the
                                Soviets will not stand in the way and will adapt their policy
                                accordingly.</item>

                            <item>The Vietnamese episode illustrates the basically competitive
                                nature of the Soviet-American relationship in Asia. Where
                                circumstances require, as in India, they will permit some tacit
                                parallelism to operate, but they will not convert it into active
                                collaboration. In Southeast Asia, they appear to be positioning
                                themselves for continued competition whatever the outcome in
                                Vietnam; they are unlikely to participate in the efforts for
                                regional organization and development which the US has in view.
                                Their attitudes on the Indonesian debt case and on the Asian
                                Development Bank show their preference for unilateralism over
                                cooperation. In Korea, they do not now encourage the North to adopt
                                an adventurous course, but neither are they willing to pay any
                                political price to restrain the North Koreans. As the Soviets see
                                it, cooperation with the US in Asia would compromise their own aims;
                                they will entertain moves in that direction only when it seems
                                necessary to contain major risks to their security and
                                interests.</item>

                            <item>If Chinese power becomes more menacing, this might provide the
                                occasion for a change in this general Soviet stance in Asia. The
                                Soviets probably do not anticipate a major threat to themselves in
                                the near term, and may still have some slight hope for the revival
                                of “healthy” forces in Chinese communism. But Moscow is clearly
                                concerned for the longer future. The Soviet leaders have given
                                signs, moreover, that they fear not only the growth of Chinese
                                military power but the possibility of an eventual rapprochement
                                between China and the US. This they would see as a major and
                                unfavorable shift in the relation of forces which they should do all
                                they could to prevent. In the long run, therefore, events may compel
                                fundamental revisions of Soviet policy. The Chinese factor seems
                                more calculated to bring this about than any other.</item>

                            <item>The Soviet leaders have reasons at this time, perhaps more than
                                ever before, to entertain a serious approach to arms control. As
                                indicated in earlier paragraphs, the burdens of the arms race have
                                been substantial in recent years, and a change in priorities would
                                contribute in some degree to forestalling economic and social
                                strains which otherwise <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0117"/>are
                                likely to become more serious, and in time, perhaps even critical.
                                In the field of strategic nuclear weapons their buildup over the
                                last several years has given the Soviets a better relative position
                                than they have ever had. Even apart from the added economic
                                pressures they would face, the Soviets may not be confident that as
                                the US moves to more advanced systems, they will be able to maintain
                                the pace technologically. They could think that stabilization in the
                                near future would give them more security than they are otherwise
                                likely to have. They might also reason that, to support the kind of
                                competitive foreign policy they are pursuing in distant areas,
                                greater emphasis on appropriate conventional forces would serve them
                                better than additional strategic nuclear strength.</item>

                            <item>However persuasive such considerations might be to some elements
                                of the regime, the reasons which others will find to oppose a
                                genuine effort to obtain a strategic arms limitation agreement will
                                also carry great weight. Grounds for mistrust of US intentions, fear
                                of ideological compromise or penetration, concern about
                                misunderstanding on the part of allies and clients will all be
                                urged. The influence of the military establishment will generally
                                work against a positive approach, though some elements might, in the
                                interests of other force components, welcome a halt to the strategic
                                weapons buildup. Given the climate of opinion ordinarily surrounding
                                so highly charged an issue, the chances of a positive approach
                                emerging would not be great, were it not for the serious dilemmas
                                which prolongation of the arms race would invoke.</item>

                            <item>What signs there are indicate that the policy-bureaucratic
                                struggle over this issue was not resolved by the decision to begin
                                strategic arms talks with the US, but in fact seems to be
                                continuing. It is likely that the decision was agreed to on the
                                basis that the Soviet approach would be exploratory, and that even
                                if no agreement was reached, some US decisions might be slowed down
                                and time gained. The fact that the move was opposed earlier,
                                however, suggests that some people in Moscow believe that, once the
                                talks get started, they may acquire a momentum of their own which
                                would propel the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> into an
                                unsound agreement.</item>

                            <item>Given the complexity of the issues, of course, the actual Soviet
                                position will be precipitated, like that of the US, only in the
                                process of negotiation. As usual, and perhaps more so because of
                                disagreement in Moscow, the Soviets will leave the initiative for
                                developing concrete proposals largely to the US. They will expect
                                the negotiations to be prolonged, and will try to make them so if
                                there are signs of domestic political pressures on the US side to
                                postpone arms decisions or to make greater concessions to Soviet
                                views. They will insist on an agreement which, whatever its actual
                                content, registers at least implicitly their <pb n="85"
                                    xml:id="pg_85" facs="0118"/>right to equality in strategic
                                power. Acknowledgment of this is, in fact, one of the principal
                                political gains they would expect to get out of the talks.</item>

                                very strong. Even though the totalitarian Party regime is in many

                            <item>Nobody can foresee what will finally happen to a system as rigid
                                as this as it comes under the increasing pressures generated by the
                                further development and modernization of the society. The ruling
                                group might succeed for a long time in simply containing such
                                pressures, even at the price of some stagnation. Some Western
                                observers assume that there will be change of a gradualist and
                                relatively benign sort, because the holders of power will consent by
                                a series of pragmatic steps to a diffusion of power to groups and
                                institutions other than the Party. Others believe that, against the
                                background of Russian political experience and the Party's own
                                history, it is more plausible to expect that change in the system
                                can come only under conditions of severe political instability and
                                disorder, perhaps even accompanied by violence in one degree or
                                another. In any case, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s

                                come to play a larger role in generating pressures for change inside

                                and might even increase them. And the US will continue to have very
                                limited means for influencing these attitudes directly. Short of

                                is for basic hostility and chronic tensions in Soviet-American
                                relations for a considerable period. As in the past, such tensions
                                will rise and fall depending on events, but more frequently than in
                                the past, these may be events in one area or another over which

                            the only concern of the Soviet Union was to prevent a change in the
                            status quo in Berlin and elsewhere in Europe. The Bonn government had
                            deliberately created a provocation. I replied that a clear precedent
                            existed so that one could hardly talk of provocation.<note n="3"

                        <p>Moscow had noted “with due attention” my comment at the previous meeting
                            that the United States had no interest in undermining the Soviet
                            position in Eastern Europe. He was authorized to assure me that in its
                            turn, the Soviet Union had no intention of undermining the status quo in
                            Western Europe. The Soviet Union was interested that the United States
                            acted on the basis of the actual conditions in Europe. <pb n="89"

                            Soviet Union did not care about formal recognition of Eastern Germany.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that this
                            was correct. I added that for us it was essential to get the access

                                >Dobrynin</persName> suggested that there had been many positive

                            re-examined. He refused to specify what those were but said he would go
                            over the record and give me some indication later. He urged me to do the
                            same, indicating that Moscow's attitude was “positive.”</p>

                                >Dobrynin</persName> quoted Moscow as saying: “We are prepared to

                            for conducting the conversations in the Soviet capital; alternatively,
                            it was willing to conduct them in Washington. New York was a definite
                            third choice. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed
                            that the Soviet Union was very seriously concerned about the Middle East
                            and willing to discuss <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the elements of the UN
                                Resolution.<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4">See <ref target="#d2fn4"
                                    >footnote 4, Document 2</ref>.</note> He asked whether the
                            United States was willing to envisage Israeli troop withdrawal. I said
                            if there were proper guarantees for the new frontiers, it would
                            certainly have to be talked about. Speaking privately, I added that it
                            seemed to me improbable that Israel would be prepared to withdraw to its
                            pre-1967 frontiers. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            replied that Moscow understood this. The Soviet Union was willing to
                            discuss every aspect of the Middle East, including guarantees. However,
                            he added, this was one of the “important and delicate” subjects that
                            should be discussed in the <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> channel. He then repeated that the subjects
                            Moscow was willing to discuss were frontiers, guarantees,
                            communications, waterways and refugees. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> indicated that he thought that the real
                            negotiation would have to be bilateral United States-Soviet Union and
                            that he regarded the four-power meeting in New York as largely
                            window-dressing. He added “we are willing to discuss <hi rend="italic"
                                >any</hi> question including those that concern Israel.”</p>
                        <p>Turning to Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that Moscow had noted our previous conversation. He inquired whether I
                            was aware of Zorin's call on Lodge,<note n="5" xml:id="d23fn5">The

                                xml:id="d24fn2">See <ref target="#d11fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    11</ref>.</note> and told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that the Middle East problem had been one of
                            the principal subjects of discussion, particularly with the British and
                            the French. In response to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>'s specific inquiry, the Secretary said that the
                            French position initially had been a piecemeal approach but it seemed
                            now to be closer to our own position in the sense that the French now
                            recognize the need for working out an overall settlement before Israeli
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we felt it would be desirable to have quiet
                            bilateral talks with the Soviets, and it was his view that we should
                            begin these talks in Washington and perhaps at a later date they could
                            be continued in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet
                            preference, of course, would be Moscow, but he felt that his Government
                            would agree with the Secretary's suggestion. After some discussion it
                            was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> would
                            meet with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> on
                            Friday, March 14.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary suggested that the talks might proceed on the basis of the
                            Soviet December 30 plan<note n="3" xml:id="d24fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d1fn4">footnote 4, Document 1</ref>.</note> as well as
                            our own proposals which are now in the process of preparation. The
                            Secretary pointed out that these private bilateral talks should not be
                            considered a substitute for Four-Power talks in New York. It was his
                            feeling that such talks among the Four Powers might begin the following
                            week. As the Secretary saw it, the principal purpose of the Four-Power
                            talks should be to provide support for the <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> mission since there seemed to be general
                            agreement among the Four Powers that it was essential that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> continue his efforts
                            to bring the parties directly involved together. The Secretary felt that
                            Four-Power meetings in New York should be private, and this was also the
                            view of the British and French. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviets also would favor private
                            talks, and he felt that there would be no objection to the timetable set
                            forth by the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>There was a brief discussion of the Soviet December 30 plan, with the
                            Secretary pointing out that some points needed clarification. For
                            example, it was not clear from the text of the plan that the Soviet
                            position on freedom of navigation extended to the Suez Canal as well as
                            the Gulf of Aquaba. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that he felt that paragraph 2 of the Soviet plan was a clear statement
                            of the Soviet position, and the subsequent specific reference to the
                            Gulf of Aquaba, did not mean that the Soviets did not favor freedom of
                            navigation in Suez for all parties as well.</p>
                        <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>The Secretary made clear that we cannot persuade Israel to enter into any
                            agreement which would not provide the Israelis with the security that
                            they seek. While it is true, as <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> pointed out, that the Soviets stand for the
                            continued existence of the State of Israel, the Arab position is much
                            less clear. Arab leaders continue to state publicly their desire to
                            destroy Israel, and so long as this attitude persists it is not likely
                            that the Israelis would be prepared to withdraw their forces from areas
                            they now occupy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that there
                            can be no peace in the Middle East so long as Israel insists rigidly on
                            its own requirements. A peace settlement must respond to the interests
                            of all parties. So far as Israel's security is concerned, this could be
                            satisfied by a Security Council guarantee or a Four-Power guarantee.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pointed out that the
                            Soviet position is flexible on this question.</p>

                        <p>During their March 8, 1969, conversation (see <ref target="#d24">Document
                                24</ref>), Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William

                                >Anatoliy Dobrynin</persName> also discussed recent developments in
                            Vietnam, including the possibility of U.S. retaliation for North
                            Vietnamese attacks on South Vietnamese cities. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> raised the option of engaging in
                            private talks with North Vietnam and four-party talks among the United
                            States, Republic of Vietnam, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and
                            National Liberation Front on political issues. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that he considered this
                            an important change in U.S. policy and he would report it to Moscow. A
                            memorandum of their conversation is in <ref target="frus1969-76v06#d32">

                        <p>Later that evening, from 6:25 to 7:10 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Henry Kissinger</persName> spoke on the telephone with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, who was in Key
                            Biscayne, Florida, about a number of issues including Vietnam. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> complained to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> about <persName

                            to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: “We weren't saying
                            we didn't want to discuss political questions. I think, myself, we would
                            have wound up, in this first testing period, in a weak position in a
                            tough sequence of events. My concern is they will now feel free to press
                            us along in these private talks.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> responded, “We can't be boxed in where we are at
                            the <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0126"/>mercy of the fact that we
                            can't hit the north and we can't have private talks. We will have no
                            bargaining position.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            stated that after 4 weeks of pressing publicly for military and
                            political talks, the North Vietnamese had achieved that and “they can go
                            to private talks and string them out.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> suggested that <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> “can cut that down by making clear to the
                            Soviets and I will say so in my press conference, there will be no
                            compromise on this coalition government [within South Vietnam].”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that, “I
                            don't believe it will be easy for you to attack Cambodia while private
                            talks are going on and not much is being done in South Vietnam.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> replied that, “My point
                            is if, while the private talks are going on and they are kicking us, we
                            are going to do something.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> returned to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>–<persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> conversation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> stated that “There is not going
                            to be any de-escalation. State has nothing to do with that. We are just
                            going to keep giving word to Wheeler to knock hell out of them.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that, “If
                            they hit us again, we must refuse to have private talks for another
                            week.” The President stated: “We cannot tolerate one more of these
                            without hitting back. We have already warned them. Presumably they have
                            stopped. If they hit us again, we hit them with no warning. That is the
                            way we are going to do it. I can't tolerate argument from <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> on this. You warn once. However,
                            if they don't hit us, we are screwed.” (Library of Congress, Manuscript

                            p.m. to ask whether I could see him that evening or the next morning. I
                            agreed to drop by the Soviet Embassy about 9:00 p.m. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was extremely cordial. He met

                            and, after some social conversation about their daughter, they both
                            mentioned that Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                            hoping to call on Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then handed me a brief

                            which the Soviet Union proposed to hand to the Germans the next day,
                            designed to meet some of the German concerns about the <gloss

                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the note had been influenced by some
                            of our suggestions and was given to us simply for our information and as
                            a token of their good faith. (An analysis of the note is attached at Tab

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then told me that he had
                            been extremely pleased by his conversation with the Secretary of
                                State.<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">See <ref target="#d25">Document
                                    25</ref>.</note> There had been real progress toward four-power
                            talks on Vietnam, including political topics. I told him that this was a
                            little premature. The Secretary of State had described what would be the
                            end result, but I was sure that our position was to continue to discuss
                            withdrawals on a bilateral basis with the DRV. Political questions
                            should be handled by Saigon and the NLF. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said the NLF found it difficult to go into a
                            forum with its mortal enemy. Hanoi told Moscow that they wanted a
                            four-power meeting so that all the participants could work on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> in order to make it more adaptable. I
                            said that I had correctly interpreted your thinking and I could not go
                            beyond that. The initial contacts would have to be bilateral.</p>
                        <p>I then said the President was determined to end the war in Vietnam one
                            way or the other. There was no intention to humiliate Hanoi. We
                            recognized they had sacrificed a great deal and we would be generous. At
                            the same time, we had certain conditions that had to be satisfied. I
                            repeated that you were determined to end the war one way or the other.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> smiled and said you
                            would find it difficult to escalate—there just were not very many things
                            we could do militarily that would not cost us more than they were worth.
                            I said, we shall see.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me what I
                            thought of the Sino-Soviet dispute, especially the fight along the
                            Ussuri River.<note n="5" xml:id="d27fn5">On March 11, at approximately
                                10 p.m., <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> spoke on
                                the telephone with <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and
                                summarized his earlier conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> reported that “<persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName> asked how we evaluated that Chinese clash.
                                I told him we think it is their problem. We don't presume to give
                                them advice. We won't play any little games. We try to settle
                                things, but if threatened, we will do what we have to. Obviously,
                                this is much on their minds.” <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> stated that “Sometimes events which we could
                                not have foreseen may have some helpful effect—who knows.” <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> responded, “If one
                                evaluates accounts of events, we gained more from that clash than we

                                    corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> then stated, “It must have
                                shook the North Vietnamese.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> agreed that “It must be a warning to Hanoi
                                it can happen again.” (Ibid.)</note> I said we regarded it primarily
                            as a problem for China and the Soviet Union and we did not propose to
                            get involved. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> became
                            very emotional and said China was everybody's problem. He asked whether
                            we would try to take advantage of the Soviet Union's difficulties. I
                            said that he had probably seen enough of the President to recognize that
                            the President was not playing for petty stakes. We had offered serious
                            negotiations to the Soviet Union; we meant to pursue them. At the same
                            time, if the Soviet Union tried to embarrass or humiliate, we would take
                            appropriate countermeasures without much fanfare. However, my presence
                                <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0130"/>in his apartment in such
                            informal circumstances indicated the seriousness with which the
                            President took Soviet-American relations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> then gave me a gory account of the atrocities
                            committed by the Chinese. He spent about fifteen minutes describing the
                            military situation. I listened politely but made no comment.</p>
                        <p>At the end, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me
                            whether I was willing to meet him on a purely social basis to see some
                            color slides of the Soviet Union. I told him yes.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                        <p>I should like to use the occasion of Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>'s assumption of his duties as my
                            Ambassador in Moscow to share with you my thoughts on the future of
                            relations between our two countries.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I should like to assure you that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> has my complete confidence and is
                            fully familiar with my views. You may be certain that he will
                            communicate to me promptly and in complete confidence any views that you
                            and your colleagues may wish to convey to me at any time.</p>
                        <p>Because of the awesome power our two countries represent we, as heads of
                            government, carry the gravest responsibilities for the peace and safety
                            of the world. I am prepared to explore with you and your colleagues
                            every available avenue for the settlement of international problems,
                            particularly those that involve the danger of confrontation or conflict.
                            I am determined to see us enter an era of negotiations and to leave
                            behind the tensions and confrontations of the past.</p>
                        <p>I am encouraged by the contacts that have already been initiated by our
                            two governments on the problems of the Middle East. It is essential that
                            both our countries exert a calming influence on this situation which,
                                <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0131"/>as the past has shown, is
                            fraught with profound dangers for peace not only in the immediate area
                            in question but for the rest of the world. I believe that no outside
                            power must seek advantages in this area at the expense of any other; on
                            the contrary it is, in my view, the duty of all outside powers,
                            especially the great powers, to help create conditions in which the
                            opposing sides can find a solution that protects their essential and
                            legitimate interests, as foreseen in the Security Council resolution of
                            November 1967. I believe that the willingness of our two countries to
                            exert a responsible and beneficial influence in the Middle East is an
                            essential element in building the confidence that must be the basis of
                            serious and productive negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I am aware of the constructive role which your government has played at
                            certain stages of the search for a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam
                            conflict. I am aware also of the great influence which you possess in
                            North Vietnam by virtue of your military support to that country. In the
                            spirit of candor which I hope will mark communications between us, I
                            would ask you to continue using that great influence in the direction of
                            peace. For peace is what I am striving to achieve, patiently and in a
                            spirit of conciliation. The effort toward peace cannot of course be
                            confined exclusively to the conference table; it must be reflected in
                            Vietnam itself. As Commander in Chief I am responsible for the safety of
                            American troops and I must also meet solemn commitments to the
                            Government of the Republic of South Vietnam. But my country has
                            demonstrated its readiness for moderation that takes into account the
                            legitimate concerns of the Government of North Vietnam. Moderation,
                            however, must be mutual and I believe that you can be influential in
                            that direction. In any event, it is my conviction that the era of
                            negotiation which I believe we both wish to embark upon would be
                            seriously burdened if the day of peace in Southeast Asia cannot be
                            brought closer.</p>
                        <p>I believe, Mr. Chairman, that our responsibilities also require the
                            avoidance of crises and the removal of threats to peace in Europe. I was
                            disturbed by the recent flare-up of tensions in Berlin. As I pointed out
                            to your Ambassador, my country is committed to the integrity of West
                            Berlin; it is committed also to fulfilling the obligations and
                            exercising the rights stemming from four-power agreements. Here as
                            elsewhere, unilateral attempts to change the existing situation to the
                            advantage of one side would place obstacles on the road to peace. I
                            believe that any change must be the result of agreement and should
                            improve on the unsatisfactory aspects of the existing situation. If you
                            have suggestions that would make the situation in Berlin mutually more
                            satisfactory, I would, of course, be interested in hearing them.</p>
                        <p>More generally with regard to Europe, I would hope that there, too,
                            negotiation rather than confrontation will mark our future relations. I
                            am conscious of the great suffering endured by the Soviet people in the
                            past because war was carried to your soil across your <pb n="99"
                                xml:id="pg_99" facs="0132"/>Western frontier. It is undoubtedly the
                            responsibility of the Soviet Government to ensure that such a disaster
                            does not occur again. At the same time, I am bound to say that last
                            year's events in Czechoslovakia produced a profound shock in American
                            opinion. Our commitments to our European allies are solely for defense
                            and for the production of their legitimate security interests. This
                            should not be an issue between us.</p>
                        <p>As countries with the largest arsenals of modern weapons in the world, we
                            carry a special responsibility for the control of armaments. The era of
                            negotiation to which I have referred must clearly include efforts toward
                            disarmament. I am confident that progress toward the solution of the
                            great political problems that engage our interests can be matched by
                            progress toward curbing competition in arms; for there can be no doubt
                            that such competition, especially if unrestrained, is utterly wasteful
                            and would not, ultimately, enhance anyone's security. I can assure you
                            that my decisions in this area will be guided solely by the principle of
                            “sufficiency,” that is, by the principle that our military strength will
                            be only that which is required to ensure the safety of this country and
                            meet the commitments to our allies. We base this on the assumption that
                            you will adhere to a similar policy for your country. Military
                            requirements depend, among other things, on the crises and dangers that
                            confront us in the world. As the dangers recede, I am convinced so can
                            the levels of arms in our arsenals. These are the simple and, I believe,
                            realistic principles that will guide me in negotiations on disarmament.
                            It is my sincere hope that in the years of my Administration you and we
                            can increasingly cooperate so that the burden of arms that our people
                            bear can be lessened.</p>
                        <p>If I may sum up the approach to our relations that I have sought to
                            convey to you in this message, it is simply that I intend to safeguard
                            the interests of my country with due regard to the interests of yours;
                            that in this spirit we should join together, wherever and whenever
                            possible, to curb the dangers and eliminate the sources of conflict. I
                            would like to remain in frequent and candid communication with you
                            through our Ambassadors and otherwise; my representatives stand ready,
                            and indeed have already begun, to explore with you the whole range of
                            issues that confront us and the means to make our relations increasingly
                            cooperative and constructive.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> is extremely
                                articulate. He is very skilled, however, in talking a great deal,
                                seemingly in response to a question without ever directly answering
                                the question. It was necessary on several occasions to repeat a
                                question in a different way three or four times in order to get a
                                more direct response.</p>

                                “Is there a new <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>?”, was
                                accurate and that he does appear to be a man who has a broad-gauged
                                view of world problems and, though firm, is not what you consider
                                rigid “hard line” and would approach the solution to problems with a
                                knowledgeable, open and reasonable attitude?</p>

                                feelings. But of course we have had no real opportunity to negotiate

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: What is the outlook
                                for expanding trade between the Soviet Union and the United States?
                                We would like to do more business with your country and it would
                                benefit both economies. It is rather ridiculous for us to ship vodka
                                to Denmark and have them rebottle it and sell it to the United
                                States when we could sell it direct. When the Italians assured us
                                that they could purchase $30 million of machine tools for the Fiat
                                factory being built in Russia from the United States, we were highly
                                skeptical and we were proven right. America always puts politics
                                ahead of good sound economics and I am not optimistic about trading
                                opportunities between our two countries.</p>
                            <p>Percy: You have asked whether most favored nation treatment could be
                                extended to the Soviet Union and indicated that you feel no real
                                trade of significance compared with what went on for instance in
                                1930 could be carried on without such treatment. I would have to say
                                the chances would not be good for extension of this position to the
                                Soviet Union under the present circumstances. However, normalizing
                                East-West relationships has to be approached step by step and I
                                would suggest that it might be practical to consider extending
                                    <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> treatment to some other
                                eastern European country such as Czechoslovakia, putting it on the
                                same basis as Poland and Yugoslavia, which would at least be a step
                                in this direction.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: This sounds logical
                                though I cannot see why Americans are so afraid of trading with the
                                Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>Percy: It is directly related to the threats to American security and
                                the security of other nations. For instance, if the Administration
                                were to propose <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> being extended
                                to the Soviet Union today, the first opposition would come from
                                those who would talk about the amount of war materials being
                                supplied to North Vietnam by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> to kill American boys in South Vietnam and that
                                nothing can be done to just strengthen an economy with this the end
                                result. You have mentioned automobile manufacture but you also have
                                indicated that an agreement to manufacture trucks would be most
                                interesting from your standpoint. The provision of technical
                                assistance for the mass production of trucks would be directly
                                related to the kind of military assistance that you would be
                                providing to North Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: We do not like to
                                think we need technical assistance as we are capable of making
                                anything we want to make. But it does stand <pb n="104"
                                    xml:id="pg_104" facs="0137"/>to reason that we can benefit from
                                mass production techniques. But if we do not make agreements with
                                the United States we can always make agreements with European
                                countries. The machine tools that the United States would not
                                furnish for the Fiat factory are all obtainable in Western Europe
                                and these countries sell freely to us and are glad to have the
                                business.</p>

                                However, I am concerned about the very strong reaction in Moscow
                                among our leadership against statements made by your Defense

                                tried to picture the average American sitting in front of his

                                talk about the Soviet intention to make a first strike on the United
                                States, thus depicting us as the worst kind of people. Even taking
                                into account the fact that we know he is trying to sell the American
                                people and the Congress on an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>

                                spent many days at a resort thirty miles from Moscow where <persName

                                wives and their children and I know their reactions as human beings.
                                They do not like to be put in the position of appearing to plot
                                millions of deaths or used this way for the purpose of selling an
                                American defense program. I am concerned about their reaction as
                                they have not formulated their judgment on the <persName

                                to hold back any judgments that might be premature. In fact, we have
                                not wanted in any way to poison the Russian people against the

                                feeling in Moscow that the United States is really not interested in
                                disarmament talks.<note n="11" xml:id="d29fn11">

                                principles had been laid down for such discussions. Then certain
                                advisers to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> started
                                to attach all sorts of conditions to these talks involving such
                                issues as Vietnam. We said that we would be glad to talk about
                                Vietnam or any other subject the United States wished to discuss,
                                but would not make agreements in advance. We were not particularly
                                anxious to have a summit meeting with an administration that had
                                only a few months left in office but were willing to do so. But it
                                never came about.</p>
                            <p>With the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration
                                we are ready to have talks on disarmament tomorrow. We would also be
                                willing to discuss any other subject with the Administration, but as
                                recently as two weeks ago we were told that such talks could be held
                                within a period of “up to six months.” This did not reassure Moscow
                                that the United States was serious about wanting talks. The
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Administration said
                                that it needed time to prepare for such talks. But look at the
                                amount of time it has been putting into appearing before Congress
                                and on television to try to sell an <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                                    >ABM</gloss> system. It has also put in a lot of time analyzing
                                such a system and coming up with a program. This same amount of time
                                could have been put into preparing for disarmament talks that
                                certainly should not take six months if America considered them
                                important. It is a matter of priorities and the United States may
                                not think this is an important subject, at least that is the
                                impression they give.</p>
                            <p>Percy: The President may consider disarmament talks less meaningful
                                when we both possess the power to annihilate each other—even were
                                production stopped at the present level—if we leave unresolved
                                serious political difficulties that could bring about conflict.</p>

                                preconditions cannot be established if disarmament talks are to be

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: Let me ask you how
                                you regard China and what your relationships should be with
                                China.</p>
                            <p>Percy: In my opinion it is dangerous to regard China as an “outlaw”
                                nation, and we should try to bring her within the community of <pb
                                    n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0139"/>nations providing she will
                                meet acceptable standards of conduct. But China has shown no
                                inclination to act as a civilized member of society. She has
                                steadily reduced her level of diplomatic contact with the rest of
                                the world, and it will be interesting to see how long she lets
                                Canada, where a good trading relationship could be built, cool its
                                heels on its suggestion for diplomatic recognition. We have had one
                                irrational ruler in our lifetime, Adolf Hitler, and it is always
                                possible that we could have another.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: China's actions
                                against us on the border have been an interesting case in point.
                                They selected an unoccupied island which complicated our military
                                options. Had we moved across the water to their side, they would
                                have screamed that we were invading them, and yet they were able to
                                raid, withdraw and be in a position of challenging and even
                                embarrassing the mighty Russian Army.</p>
                            <p>Percy: Going back to disarmament, let me ask for your reaction to a
                                purely personal suggestion. What would you think of a mutual
                                moratorium by Russia and the United States on the emplacement of
                                missiles and nuclear warheads? Acceptable verification means are
                                available. Today there is a rough parity between the United States
                                and the Soviet Union. We do not know how long disarmament talks
                                would take to complete and, during the process of negotiation, an
                                extensive build-up of missiles by one side or the other might upset
                                the balance. This would seem, therefore, an excellent time for a
                                joint moratorium. It might provide an improved atmosphere for the
                                talks and the talks would have a better chance to succeed.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: Such a proposal
                                could certainly be considered but to even consider it we would have
                                to get talks under way and I see no real inclination to do this.</p>
                            <p>Percy: In his testimony this morning Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said that talks could begin
                                within a few months.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: I do not know what
                                your definition of “few” is. All I know is that I was told up to six
                                months and that does not appear to me as though there is any real
                                desire to get talks under way.</p>
                            <p>Percy: I am not a spokesman for the Administration and in fact
                                regretfully find that I differ sometimes with its judgments.
                                However, I will convey your impressions to the appropriate parties
                                and it would be my own hope that talks could be gotten under way
                                soon. However, the events in Czechoslovakia made it impossible to
                                hold talks heretofore and talks could be set back again if there
                                were other unfortunate happenings in that area.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Percy: I do believe it would be important to bring Vietnam into the
                                context of our talks since one act of easing tensions should relate
                                    <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0140"/>to another. I am deeply
                                disturbed by the lack of progress in the Paris talks. There are, of
                                course, some in this country who would withdraw from South Vietnam
                                regardless of the consequences, though I believe they are very few
                                in number. There are many more who feel that the cessation of
                                bombing by the United States has been used by the North Vietnamese
                                only to build up their own forces and has enabled them to undertake
                                another offensive which has cost many American lives. There would be
                                a strong body of support for the President ordering a resumption of
                                bombing in the North, particularly to cut off supply lines. There
                                are many who would support very heavy bombing on the basis that
                                representations to us have been betrayed and that the North
                                Vietnamese are making no serious effort to find the basis for a
                                negotiated political settlement.</p>

                                foolish, in my judgment. First of all, it would be ineffective as
                                has been proved by all of the past bombing done by the United States
                                in North Vietnam. It merely unifies the North Vietnamese and
                                requires a greater level of support by both China and
                                    ourselves.<note n="13" xml:id="d29fn13">

                                if we were to remain credible in the eyes of other Socialist
                                    countries.<note n="14" xml:id="d29fn14">

                                    this sentence.</note> The bombing of concentrated urban areas in
                                World War II failed to conquer a people or defeat them. That could
                                only be done by land armies. Of course if you intend to invade North
                                Vietnam with your land forces that would require a minimum of one
                                million men and would call for an equal or greater response by the
                                Chinese Army. Where would all of this get you? You already have a
                                great problem with world opinion. It is difficult to convince
                                people—the average person—that you are not a warlike nation. One of
                                the greatest difficulties I have when I go home is with my father
                                and his friends. I have been in the United States now going on my
                                eighth year. My father is a plumber, he works with his hands, he is
                                a simple man and so are his friends. But they are worried about the
                                intentions of the United States.</p>
                            <p>There are many Russians who believe that the United States is going
                                to wage war on the Soviet Union. All that our government would have
                                to do is say that we are going to cut back on housing, on consumer
                                goods and other forms of civilian production, and we are going to
                                double our output of armaments. We can do anything that we feel we
                                have to do and the Russian people will fully support us and back us
                                up.</p>

                            <p>You must take into account that the military in the Soviet Union does
                                not have anywhere near the power and influence that it has in the
                                United States. Your Secretary of Defense sits in the Cabinet, and he
                                consults with the President more than almost any other top official.
                                Your military interests are strong in the Congress. This condition
                                simply does not exist in the Soviet Union. The head of our military
                                is not even a member of the Politburo and only infrequently sits in
                                on major political discussions affecting national policies.</p>
                            <p>Percy: On the other side of the scale you must take into account, and
                                the world should take into account, that the United States has not
                                used its power for the expansion of its own territories, and our
                                government must take into account in its planning the fact that the
                                Soviet Union is building either five or 25 megaton ICBM's which do
                                not enhance the peace. Why is such explosive power of this magnitude
                                needed? There is talk that the Soviet Union is orbiting nuclear
                                explosives, and this is understandably disconcerting to our average
                                citizen.</p>

                                Mideast. It is important to find a basis for settlement not only
                                because of the danger for the nations directly involved, but also
                                because we must try to avoid situations which could bring our own
                                two nations into dangerous confrontation.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>: I cannot see the
                                situation improving in the near future. It is filled with danger and
                                there can be more serious outbreaks. We must do the best we can to
                                lessen the danger through successful four-power talks which will be
                                getting under way. I agree with you that the situation is dangerous
                                and we must act positively to lessen this danger.</p>
                            <p>On departing, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                the Easter recess. The conversation was cordial and relaxed
                                throughout. On his arrival he was greeted by Loraine and our
                                children who were home from school on Easter vacation, and he was
                                extremely gracious to them. I highly recommend an informal home
                                atmosphere for relaxed discussions when an exchange of views, rather
                                than hard negotiating, is the purpose of the meeting.</p>

                        <p>Much of the discussion has taken place in highly liturgical
                            language—“just and lasting peace,” “secure and recognized boundaries,”
                            “agreement between/by the parties,” “binding agreement.” These are the
                            words of the November 1967 UN resolution and of the argument since over
                            its interpretation. They are the words in the working paper we have
                            surfaced in the Four-Power talks. What follows is an effort to identify
                            the real issues behind those words, which are hard to pin down without
                            talking about concrete proposals—something we are not yet prepared to
                            do, partly because of Israel's strong objection to that procedure.</p>

                        <p>We seem agreed on some of the more general principles: <list>

                                    has now said that Moscow does not want just another armistice.
                                    The test will come when we get down to details, but this point
                                    is worth establishing in view of Israel's concern that <persName

                                    leave us room to press for specific arrangements to make the
                                    terms of settlement as secure as possible.</item>

                                        >Dobrynin</persName> says Moscow is thinking of a settlement
                                    agreed to <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the Arabs and Israelis.
                                    While big-power talks may constitute pressure, the “question of
                                    imposing a settlement does not arise.” This point is worth
                                    establishing because the Arabs believe that all we have to do is
                                    say the word and Israel will withdraw. Even de Gaulle's thinking
                                    contains this theme. But the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                        >USSR</gloss> seems to recognize the dilemma we share—we

                                    role for the four powers independent of the UN, we and Moscow
                                    seem agreed on the desirability of keeping a formal UN buffer
                                    between us and the parties to avoid having to absorb all the
                                    shock of their reaction ourselves. This, of course, assumes

                                    are guaranteed. This is an important shift from the 1967 Soviet

                            between Arabs and Israelis after a settlement? Moscow has circulated
                            (December 30) a specific sequence of agreements and implementing steps
                            for arranging Israeli withdrawal. We have not, because we must try to
                            meet some of Israel's requirement that these specifics be worked out by
                            the Arabs and Israelis themselves. Therefore, we have chosen to describe
                            our position in terms of a set of carefully worded principles, though
                            behind these we have in mind staff studies of each major element of a
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">The issue</hi> is this: The farther we can go now in
                            defining precisely the obligations of each side, the more certain we can
                            be of Soviet motives. <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0144"/>It is
                            easy for <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to say Moscow
                            wants a real settlement. It is important for us to close as many
                            loopholes for future exploitations as possible, though frankly this is
                            difficult as long as we keep ourselves from talking specifics. So we
                            keep pressing <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to define
                            the relationship which will exist between Arabs and Israelis after a
                            settlement.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The importance of the issue</hi> is that the long-run

                            to the degree to which tensions are reduced. While Moscow profits from
                            exploiting divisions—Arab-Israeli, radical-moderate—the US has interests
                            in all these camps (friends and political interests in Jordan and
                            Israel, oil in Iraq and Saudi Arabia) and can pursue a coherent policy
                            only when tension is at a manageable level, as it was between the late

                                    that the Arab governments—more UAR, Syria, Iraq than Jordan—will
                                    sign an agreement and then stand back while the fedayeen violate
                                    it. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> discounts
                                    this possibility; he says the fedayeen will dry up when Israel
                                    withdraws. We remember how mounting terrorist activity in
                                    1966–67 started the sequence of events that led to war. We also
                                    recall that we (and apparently the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                        >USSR</gloss>) were powerless to stop this activity.
                                    Convinced that no big-power guarantees can police this, we
                                    believe it is crucial that the governments on the ground—the
                                    only ones capable of rolling up the terrorists at the
                                    source—commit themselves to stop it, at least as an organized
                                    movement. We want to be as precise as we can because we have no
                                    reason to trust <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> or
                                    the Syrians; after all it was our tacit 1957 understanding with

                            that of Israeli refusal to cooperate. We are familiar with strong

                            because we have stopped short of breaching their basic principle that
                            the Arabs and Israelis must reach the settlement themselves. It can be
                            argued that they need us and in the end will come along. That may be
                            true, but there is a large amount of go-it-alone thinking in the Israeli

                            lines must Israel withdraw? In the working paper we have circulated we
                            say that any changes in the pre-war lines should be confined to those
                            required for mutual security and should not reflect the weight of
                            conquest. But again, we have stopped short of expressing our views on
                            where the lines might be drawn, and we are arguing principle.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The issue</hi> is this: Israel is determined to redraw

                            humiliation. We have frankly resisted all insistence for return to
                            pre-war boundaries mainly because we knew we could not force Israel out
                            of Jerusalem.</p>

                            supporting Israeli expansionism, the future stability of the area will
                            depend on removing <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0146"/>as many

                                    However, one added wrinkle might be to try our hand at eliciting

                            “between” or “by” the parties. It is possible to achieve agreement of

                            again we have had to cope with Israeli insistence on direct negotiation.
                            In our working paper we have actually supported indirect negotiations to
                            start but have said that, as a practical matter, we believe direct

                            out their own arrangements. (b) We were the middle-man in 1957, and we
                            got badly burned. Therefore, we would like to see <persName

                            the arrangements are more likely to stick if the Arabs strike their
                            bargain directly with Israel and accept responsibility for it. But if

                            Israel. The problem is to devise a formula which will permit direct
                            contact as part of the phasing of implementation (see below). However,
                            the problem might also be met by attempting to arrange secret

                            giving up at each stage an advantage commensurate to what his adversary
                            is giving up? We have staff studies on the possible legal forms of
                            agreement and on the guarantees that might stiffen enforcement of the

                            at their heads. The question is how to assure Israel that the Arabs will
                            make good if it withdraws all the way. The question is equally how to
                            assure the Arabs that Israel will not just stop its withdrawal half-way

                            binding—that the costs of not meeting them as defined in the settlement
                            will be great enough to deter the Arabs from violation. Second is the
                            tactical need to structure the implementation in such a way as to
                            satisfy each side at each stage that it is getting as much as it is

                            regards to the Secretary. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had not been very well recently, having
                            fractured several bones in his wrist in an accident, but he was better
                            now. For a period of three weeks he had been unable to carry out his
                            functions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied with a request to convey his best wishes to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, whom he had met in

                            people had known him as a man <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0152"
                            />who had made great contributions to the common cause of achieving a
                            victory over fascist Germany at the time when he had been the Allied
                            Supreme Commander. The Soviet Government had therefore immediately
                            decided to send a delegation to the funeral. In this connection Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> recalled that our
                            two countries had been allies in those days, when the world situation
                            had been extremely difficult. At that time we had managed to find a good
                            understanding on very complex problems and resolve them in the interests
                            of mankind. Today the situation was also difficult and today, too, it
                            was most important to create understanding and confidence between the
                            Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet Government wanted to do
                            everything in its power to create a situation in which a better
                            understanding and confidence between the two countries would lead to a
                            solution of important international problems in the interests of our
                            peoples and all humanity. He emphasized that his government wanted to
                            achieve this goal and said that therefore any initiative from the
                            American side would be welcomed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> for his remarks and for the fact that the
                            Soviet Government had sent a high-ranking delegation to the funeral.
                            General Eisenhower had always spoken in glowing terms of his wartime
                            experiences with Soviet soldiers. It was a fact that there was a common
                            bond between the Russian people and the American people, as well as
                            great friendship between them. The Secretary referred to his brief
                            conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName>
                            of the day before, when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName> had said that when he had dealt with American
                            engineers only, his relations had been friendly indeed, and that his
                            difficulties only started when he began to deal with diplomats. As the
                            Foreign Minister knew, the Secretary had already informed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were anxious
                            to proceed to establish better relations between our two countries. The
                            best time to do so in his view, was the time when a new administration
                            came to office. We wanted to talk to Soviet representatives with an open
                            mind about many things. As the Minister knew, we were now already
                            discussing problems of the Middle East on a bilateral basis; we would
                            appreciate everything the Soviet Union could do to help us achieve a
                            peaceful settlement of the Vietnam conflict; in the months ahead we
                            wanted to go ahead with talks on arms limitation. Although we were not
                            attaching any conditions to any of these subjects and were willing to
                            deal with each of them separately, it is self-evident that a reduction
                            of tensions in one area would also be helpful to produce results in
                            others. The Secretary thought that the time had come to have
                            far-reaching talks on the many problems facing us. Our two countries had
                            a special responsibility with respect to maintaining the peace. It was
                            clear that in the absence of good relations between our two countries we
                            incur the possibility of a conflict which could destroy mankind. The
                            Secretary was therefore looking forward <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120"
                                facs="0153"/>to working with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2"
                                >Kuznetsov</persName>, with the Foreign Minister and with the
                            excellent Ambassador in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> said that he was
                            glad to hear this. He thought the present moment was one when we faced
                            many important international problems awaiting solution. If we were to
                            do nothing to improve the situation, it was quite natural that it would
                            deteriorate. He shared the Secretary's views that there was no need to
                            attach conditions to the efforts to reach agreement on any problem. He
                            knew that some people took the position that it was first necessary to
                            build up confidence so as to be able to proceed to a solution of
                            problems. He did not agree with such a position, for how could there be
                            any confidence without forward movement? He felt that confidence would
                            improve as a result of progress in the solution of important problems.
                            He referred to the time when he had worked with Ambassador Lodge, when
                            it sometimes appeared that there was no progress on disarmament because
                            of this same vicious circle. He therefore agreed with the Secretary that
                            we should not place any conditions requiring progress on one problem
                            before proceeding to another; this would unnecessarily complicate the
                            situation. We should explore all possibilities and where we could
                            proceed we should then find common language.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that from a point of view of improving the
                            relations between our two countries difficulties were often caused by
                            polemics. Speaking for the new administration he said that the President
                            and he were determined to be very careful and not say anything that
                            could be interpreted as being belligerent, since this would not be
                            conducive to good relations. He hoped that it would be possible within
                            the framework of the Soviet system to respond in kind in their press and
                            public statements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> replied that as far
                            as the Soviet leaders were concerned, they, too, had been careful not to
                            say anything bad in their statements beyond the usual explanations of
                            Soviet policy. But he was sorry that he could not say the same about
                            some of the leaders of the United States. Last night he had had a brief
                            but heated discussion with Defense Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName>. He had brought up some of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>'s arguments in favor of going
                            ahead with Safeguard, which had been presented during the Congressional
                            hearings. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> had
                            said that the Soviet Union had the intention of attacking the United
                            States with a first strike. This was, of course, not true. The Soviet
                            Union was actively pursuing all possible ideas leading to disarmament,
                            arms reduction and the stockpiling of explosive materials. The Soviet
                            Union was striving for peace and was therefore willing to consider all
                            suggestions to resolve international problems and to improve the world
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he did not think Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> had spoken of Soviet intentions,
                            but rather of Soviet capabilities, bearing <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121"
                                facs="0154"/>the SS–9 in mind. Certainly he (Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>) had given no such indication in
                            his testimony.<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">See <ref target="#d29fn3"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> remarked that
                            within the context of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName>'s testimony the impression had been created that
                            he regarded the Soviet Union as the most aggressive nation in the world.
                            The Ambassador did not know of a single article in the Soviet press
                            which had attacked the President, although Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> was criticized because of the
                            impression he had created.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the less top officials said anything that could
                            be interpreted by the public as being belligerent, the better it would
                            be for the relations between our two countries. We now had the
                            opportunity of making progress in these relations and the President and
                            he were determined to be very careful in their statements so as not to
                            impede this progress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> noted with
                            satisfaction that the President had told him last night that he
                            appreciated the responsible attitude displayed by the Soviet leadership
                            since he had taken office.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called me about 3:30

                            by saying that he had been instructed by the highest level of the

                            be presented at the State Department <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122"

                                members had urged the convening of a conference on European
                                security. The proposed agenda included an agreement renouncing the
                                use or the threat of force, and trade and technical
                                exchanges.</note> This note in effect presents the Budapest
                            Declaration of the Warsaw Pact nations, and asks for a European Security
                            Conference. (I am sending you a separate memorandum on this.)<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d32fn3">See <ref target="#d33">Document 33</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me for my views. I
                            told him a European Security Conference which excluded the United States
                            would meet with strong opposition. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that Moscow has no intention of
                            prescribing the membership; if one of our allies proposed United States
                            participation, Moscow would agree. (This represents a major change in
                            Soviet policy.)</p>
                        <p>However, it soon became clear that the note was just a pretext. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> turned the conversation to
                            Vietnam and asked me what I thought of developments. I said we were very
                            relaxed, we knew what we were doing and would not be deflected by public
                            protest. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me
                            whether we had “any intention of expanding the war.” I replied that I
                            had always told him that the President was determined to end the war one
                            way or the other. He could be sure that I did not speak idly and that I
                            hoped Hanoi kept Moscow fully informed of everything that was going on.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “You know we
                            do not have any advisers at the headquarters in South Vietnam.” I
                            replied: “Well, I hope they keep you informed of everything that goes
                            on.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked how I
                            visualized the relationship between a military and political settlement.
                            I decided to play fairly tough and said that we would probably want to
                            discuss military issues first. (I did this to preserve the option of the
                            Vance mission<note n="4" xml:id="d32fn4">
                                <p>According to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                                    memoirs, “the proposed mission involved linking the opening of
                                        <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks with an overall
                                    settlement in Vietnam.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                        >Kissinger</persName> further recalls that on March 18, he
                                    met with Cyrus Vance, who served as Deputy Chief of the U.S.
                                    delegation to the Paris peace talks until February 19, to ask
                                    him whether he would go to Moscow to discuss strategic arms
                                    limitations and to meet secretly with a DRV negotiator. Vance
                                    would discuss a political and military settlement for Vietnam,
                                    including a cease-fire, mutual troop withdrawal, and guarantees
                                    for NLF non-violent participation in South Vietnam's political
                                    life. Under the Vance proposals, South Vietnam would be free and
                                    independent, but after 5 years there would be negotiations for
                                    reunification with the North. No record of their meeting has
                                    been found.</p>
                                <p>In early April, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                                    pressed <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to
                                    authorize the Vance mission. Although the President was lukewarm
                                    about its prospects for success, he permitted <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to broach it with
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> during this
                                    meeting. The Vance mission, however, never took off. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> explains in his
                                    memoirs, “Yet no reply was ever received from Moscow—no
                                    rejection, no invitation, not even a temporizing

                            </note> and to have our willingness <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123"
                                facs="0156"/>to discuss political matters within that framework
                            serve as a concession.) I added that we could understand it, however, if
                            after the military issues were settled, Hanoi would make their
                            application dependent on progress towards a political settlement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> pretended that this
                            was a major concession and said it put a new complexion on things. He
                            said we had to understand that the NLF was reluctant to risk itself in a
                            forum with the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> since it considered
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> determined to destroy it.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether I saw
                            any chance of replacing <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NCK1">Ky</persName>. I said no, but we were
                            willing to consider safeguards for the NLF after a settlement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this was all terribly
                            complicated. The NLF did not insist on a coalition government. It would
                            settle for a peace cabinet (without <persName corresp="#p_NVT3"
                                >Thieu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NCK1">Ky</persName>)
                            which would safeguard its members.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then returned to the
                            problem of escalation. I told him it would be too bad if we were driven
                            in this direction because it was hard to think of a place where a
                            confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States made less
                            sense. I added that it seemed to me our interests in Vietnam were quite
                            compatible. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied:
                            “Our interests in Vietnam are practically identical. We might want a
                            slightly more neutral South Vietnam than you, but it is not an issue of
                            consequence.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to China. He
                            referred to a news story that I was in charge of a policy review of
                            Communist China and asked what conclusions we had reached. I said we had
                            reached no conclusions but the President's thinking was well expressed
                            to <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> when he said the
                            Soviet Union and the United States still had the power to order events
                            but that they might not have that power much longer.<note n="5"

                            said that looking at the problem from a sheer political point of view, I
                            thought China would be a major security concern of the Soviet Union no
                            matter who governed it. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            then said that it seemed to many in the Soviet Union that Formosa could
                            well be an independent state. I did not respond. <persName

                        <p>The Soviets and East Europeans are currently pushing, diplomatically and
                            through propaganda, an “appeal” adopted by the Warsaw Pact countries in
                            Budapest on March 17 which proposes an early conference on European
                            security. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            today delivered a copy to <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot

                            on April 1.)</p>
                        <p>The appeal has aroused interest in the West because it almost completely
                            is devoid of the polemical attacks on the US and the Federal Republic
                            which normally appear in Communist declarations of this sort. There are
                            no really significant new substantive proposals on how to go about
                            getting a European settlement in this document—its main concrete
                            proposition is that officials from interested European states should
                            meet to arrange a conference and its agenda. Its main theme is that if
                            the present status quo is recognized in Europe, especially by the
                            Federal Republic, there could then be extensive east-west cooperation on
                            economic and technical matters and military alliances could be
                            abolished.</p>
                        <p>On the face of it, the appeal excludes the United States from
                            participation in the proposed conference. But in the past when this
                            criticism was levelled against their European security proposals, the
                            Soviets have indicated that they are prepared to see a US role. They
                            have maintained this line privately in the present instance, too.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Soviet Objectives</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There has been speculation about the reasons why this appeal should have
                            been issued at this time. The timing may be connected with the impending
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting: the Soviets may hope
                            that the trend toward better cohesion in <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> after Czechoslovakia and as a result of your European
                            visit can be halted or reversed by a conciliatory proposition from them.
                            Beyond this tactical motivation, the Soviets may in fact be interested
                            in restoring some of the east-west contacts, <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125"
                                facs="0158"/>including economic ones, that were disrupted by their
                            invasion of Czechoslovakia. Since the document makes a number of demands
                            on the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>—including recognition of East
                            Germany, the Oder-Neisse Line and the “special status” of West Berlin,
                            as well as renunciation of nuclear weapons—the Soviets may have wanted
                            to lay the groundwork for renewed political contacts with Bonn. The
                            obverse side of that coin is, as it always has been, an effort to
                            isolate the Federal Republic by picturing it is the main obstacle to a
                            European settlement if it fails to meet Communist demands.</p>
                        <p>Another motivation that may have played a role relates to Soviet efforts
                            to consolidate the Warsaw Pact: this is the first major document in some
                            time that all the East Europeans, including Romania, have been willing
                            to sign.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Although I do not believe that in and of itself this “appeal” does
                            anything to advance the prospects of a European settlement, I believe we
                            should not give it a negative response. Rather, we might use it in our
                            effort to impress on the Soviets the need to talk concretely about the
                            issues that exist between us.</p>
                        <p>What we have said about the inutility and, indeed, dangers of holding
                            grandiose conferences at this stage should hold true in this case also;
                            but we need not rule out eventual meetings, after the necessary
                            spadework has been done to ensure that they get somewhere.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that we should make an issue of our attendance at such
                            meetings. Anyone who is serious about making progress on European
                            problems knows that we must be a party; we should not make the Soviets
                            think that they are doing us a favor if they agree to such an obvious
                            fact of life.</p>
                        <p>I do believe that in the context of a constructive response we should
                            make clear that <list>

                                <item>in our view a real settlement in Europe is incompatible with
                                    gross intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries,
                                    and</item>

                                <item>cannot be based on discrimination against Germany, since this

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>All of this, of course, looks very far into the future. But I think it
                            would be desirable for us to be in a positive if cautious posture on
                            this range of issues. This, judging from discussions at <gloss

                            in Europe.</p>

                                for future conversations and negotiations. I replied we earnestly
                                hoped to carry on continuous and rational discussion of matters of

                            <item>Principal substantive points of conversation were Middle East and

                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had little new to
                                offer. He said that he was pleased that in four bilateral talks in
                                Washington discussions had proceeded to get away from generalities
                                and down to specifics. He also stressed that Soviets are in full
                                agreement with us that understanding on a “package” settlement must
                                be reached first; then it can be implemented in phases. He said that
                                both Israelis and Arabs have too many suspicions and suggested we
                                should both help to eliminate ill-founded ones.</item>

                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries and a somewhat lengthy discussion of
                            the Middle East (reported separately),<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> the discussion
                            turned to Vietnam. I asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> whether he had had any reaction from Moscow to
                            our last conversation.<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">See <ref target="#d32"
                                    >Document 32</ref>.</note> He said he had not, but that he was
                            aware of a conversation Zorin had had with Lodge.</p>
                        <p>I then said that the President had wished me to convey his thoughts on
                            Vietnam to Moscow. We had followed the discussions in Paris with great
                            interest and considerable patience. As Lodge had already pointed out to
                            Zorin, it was very difficult to negotiate when the other side constantly
                            accused us of insincerity, when every private meeting so far had been
                            initiated by us, and when every proposition was put forward on a
                            take-it-or-leave-it basis. The President had therefore decided to make
                            one more direct approach on the highest level before drawing the
                            conclusion that the war could only be ended by unilateral means. The
                            President's personal word should be a guarantee of sincerity. After
                            showing <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> the talking
                            points and the President's initials, I read them to him.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d36fn4">See <ref target="#d35">Document 35</ref>.</note> He
                            took copious notes, stopping every once in a while to ask for an
                            explanation. When I said we wanted to have the negotiations concluded
                            within two months, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that if this proposal was feasible at all, we would be able to tell
                            after the first week of negotiations whether they would lead anywhere.
                                <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0164"/>When I got through,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether I was
                            saying that unless the Vietnam war was settled, we would not continue
                            our discussions on the Middle East and not enter the talks on strategic
                            arms. I replied that we were prepared to continue talking but that we
                            would take measures which might create a complicated situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that whatever
                            happens in Vietnam, the Soviet leaders were eager to continue talking.
                            He then asked whether these new measures might involve Soviet ships. I
                            replied that many measures were under intensive study. In dealing with
                            the President, it was well to remember that he always did more than he
                            threatened and that he never threatened idly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said he hoped we
                            understand the limitations of Soviet influence in Hanoi. We had to
                            understand that while the Soviet Union might recommend certain steps, it
                            would never threaten to cut off supplies. He could tell me that the
                            Soviet Union had been instrumental in helping to get the talks started.
                            Moreover, Communist China was constantly accusing the Soviet Union of
                            betraying Hanoi. The Soviet Union could not afford to appear at a
                            Communist meeting and find itself accused of having undermined a fellow
                            Socialist country. On the other hand, the Soviet Union had no strategic
                            interest in Southeast Asia. The chief reasons for its support of North
                            Vietnam have been the appeals of a fellow Socialist country. I could be
                            sure that the President's proposal would be transmitted to Hanoi within
                            24 hours. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> added that
                            often Soviet messages were never answered by Hanoi so he could not
                            guarantee what the reply would be or indeed if there would be a
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that the North
                            Vietnamese were using the following agreement with Moscow and he
                            stressed that Moscow did not necessarily agree with it: The Saigon
                            Government was composed of individuals committed to the destruction of
                            the NLF. The NLF would not enter a political confrontation in which the
                            administrative apparatus was in the hands of people who sought to
                            destroy them. The NLF would not insist on participating in the
                            Government but it would insist that the Government be broadened and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NCK1">Ky</persName> be removed. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that he was simply
                            stating Hanoi's arguments, not endorsing them.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was familiar with Hanoi's arguments since they were
                            being made to us as well. Nevertheless, the best policy for the NLF
                            would be to work out guarantees for its political participation <hi
                                rend="italic">after</hi> a settlement of the war. They would
                            certainly find us forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reiterated Moscow's
                            desire to stay in negotiations with us whatever happened in Vietnam. He
                            told me many anecdotes of Stalin as well as of Molotov. He added that
                            the Soviet Union had intended to send Marshal Zhukov to Eisenhower's
                            funeral but Zhukov <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0165"/>had recently
                            had two strokes and was partially paralized. He then asked whether we
                            understood that Communist China was attempting to produce a clash
                            between the Soviet Union and the United States. If the war in Vietnam
                            escalates, it would only service Communist China's interest. I replied
                            that this was the precise point the President had tried to make to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> on the occasion of
                            the Eisenhower funeral. It was, therefore, incumbent on the Soviet Union
                            to help us remove this danger. We felt that in this period, the great
                            nuclear powers still have the possibility of making peace.</p>
                        <p>As he was preparing to leave, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> asked me whether he could read over the talking
                            points once more. I handed them to him and he read them slowly and
                            carefully. He departed saying “this has been a very important
                            conversation.”</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that Moscow had asked him to talk to me
                            about the situation in the Middle East. Moscow was prepared to come to
                            an understanding on the Middle East as rapidly as possible. On the other
                            hand, Moscow's feeling was that we were proceeding too abstractly. The
                            principles put forward by <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joseph
                                Sisco</persName> were all very well, but the key issue was the
                            location of the frontiers and other matters. He felt that we should put
                            forward a proposal which would be kept in strictest confidence and the
                            Soviet Union would see whether they could turn it into a joint offer to
                            both sides. I replied that we did not want to be in a position where we
                            had to make all the proposals, deliver all the parties and take all the
                            criticism. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said <pb
                                n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0166"/>that the Soviet Union would do
                            a great deal to make an agreement but “you have to be specific.” For
                            example, the U.S. constantly asked for a contractual agreement. However,
                            it had never stated what it understood by a contractual agreement. “Why
                            don't you write out a paragraph that tells us exactly what you want
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> to say and if we agree
                            with it, we will try to get them to accept it.” Similarly, he said it
                            was impossible for the Soviet Union to know what we had in mind about
                            troop withdrawals. The U.S. spoke of border rectification but we had
                            given no indication of where the frontier was to be. He added that “the
                            Soviet Union did not care about Golan Heights or the Gaza Strip. Indeed,
                            whether the borders were 30 miles east or west is of no difference to us
                            as long as both sides agree.” I told him that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> was likely to produce a scheme
                            within the next two weeks. If it presented any difficult problems, I
                            suggested <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> get in touch
                            with me.</p>

                                    <item>They state flatly that they are not talking of “some kind
                                        of truce but of a <hi rend="italic">complete cessation of

                                        commitment to “peace” Israel wants but it also looks like
                                        less than an effort to leave loopholes for later aggression

                            <p>On the negative side, the Soviet answers specifically advise against
                                raising the question of direct negotiations. We have been thinking
                                that being able to provide a meeting under <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> would make it easier for us
                                to bring the Israelis along. They also envision smaller DMZ's than
                                we do.</p>
                            <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0170"/>
                            <p>The Soviet questions try to pin us down on how much negotiating room
                                we plan to leave the Israelis on where the boundaries are drawn, on
                                what kinds of international guarantees we have in mind and on our
                                specific ideas about Gaza, Sharm al-Shaykh and refugees.</p>
                            <p>Conclusions: The Soviets continue to move in our direction on
                                procedural issues. This helps because these are important to Israel.
                                The Soviets may be a lot tougher when we try to enlarge their view
                                of DMZ's or discuss what will amount to infringements or UAR
                                sovereignty to police demilitarization or free navigation. In any
                                case, we do seem now to be in a reasonable negotiation with the full
                                engagement of the top echelons in the Kremlin.</p>

                                the decision on making our position more specific.</p>
                            <p>Joe opened the meeting by expressing concern at the firefights on the
                                Suez Canal. He told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                                we would discuss the matter with Israel and asked if the Soviets
                                were prepared to talk to the Egyptians. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName> hedged, but said he would take note of U.S.
                                concern.</p>
                            <p>Most of the meeting was taken up by replies to questions <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had asked at the previous
                                meeting. Before replying, Joe explained that his answers would not
                                go beyond what we had said before but are not our last word. We were
                                considering these questions in connection with a possible
                                substantive document.</p>
                            <p>He made the following points, which you know by heart, in the

                                    <item>We feel that the parties should accept the resolution and
                                        implement all its provisions. We put the emphasis on
                                        agreement between the parties.</item>

                                    <item>A refugee settlement must respond to the requirements for
                                        justice for the refugees, but must also take into account
                                        Israeli security concerns. Each refugee should have a choice
                                        among (1) returning to Israel to live under Israeli law, (2)
                                        compensation and resettlement in the country where he now
                                        resides, and (3) compensation and resettlement in other
                                        countries. Refugees from the 1967 war would return home. We
                                        feel that not many refugees would choose to live in Israel.
                                        We have no definite conclusions on the machinery to
                                        implement this plan.</item>

                                    <item>Sharm al-Shaykh is important because of its location and
                                        is a difficult problem because the Israelis are unwilling to
                                        trust anyone else with keeping the Straits of Tiran open,
                                        and the UAR will not accept an Israeli presence there. We
                                        feel this has to be worked out by the parties, but are not
                                        ruling out any solution.</item>

                            <p>You should be aware that State has informed the British Embassy of
                                the possibility of a joint Soviet-U.S. paper on the Near East. It
                                was necessary to do so to lessen British pressure for raising the
                                idea of a multilateral document soon in the four-power talks. The
                                British feel that this knowledge will allow the Foreign Office to

                            <item>In handing over his written message the President has asked me to
                                say that his purpose was to set forth his general approach to our
                                relations. Explorations and negotiations on the specific issues
                                should, he feels, be carried on through our Ambassadors and other
                                representatives, as the case may be, rather than through formal
                                written communications. He would like to keep our contacts as
                                confidential as possible and feels that written messages may reduce
                                our flexibility in dealing with complex and sensitive issues. This
                                does not of course exclude our reducing to writing any
                                understandings reached.</item>

                            <item>With regard to the Middle East, we share your assessment that our
                                bilateral talks in Washington have brought our views somewhat
                                closer. We see these talks as a vehicle for helping the parties to
                                narrow the differences between them. We hope therefore that these
                                talks as well as the wider discussions in New York will provide
                                useful support to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> in his further efforts with the parties. The
                                President is mindful of the fact that Soviet flexibility is limited
                                by your relations with the Arab countries, just as our own position
                                must take into account the interests of the countries involved.
                                However both of us <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0173"/>must be
                                prepared to accept certain burdens if negotiations are to succeed.
                                The President continues to hope that progress toward a viable
                                settlement will improve chances of placing restraints on outside
                                military assistance to countries of the region; indeed, the
                                President remains ready to discuss such restraints even under
                                present circumstances.</item>

                                of the Soviet position due to your relations with China and your
                                position in the communist movement. We have no intention to exploit
                                whatever constructive influence the Soviets may be able to exert on
                                Hanoi for any other purpose than the establishment of peace.</item>

                                        of Japan. The North Koreans claimed that the U.S. plane had

                                        then shot down approximately 80 miles at sea. On April 15,

                                example of developments in the area which lead to increased tension
                                and which must be a source of concern to the Soviet Government as
                                well as to us. We hope the Soviet Union will do what it can to
                                restrain the North Koreans from such irresponsible acts since we
                                believe it to be in our mutual interest to avoid further
                                exacerbation of tension in the area.</item>

                            <item>More specifically on China, we have been concerned by the
                                deterioration in Sino-Soviet relations. We have no interest in
                                seeing these two countries in conflict and certainly have no
                                intention to exploit their present difficulties. We do hope over the
                                long run to achieve some normalization in our relations with China
                                and were disappointed by the aborting of the Warsaw talks. If these
                                talks resume, or other contacts eventuate with the Chinese, we will
                                continue, as did the previous Administration, to keep the Soviets
                                informed.</item>

                            <item>As regards Berlin and Germany, we would welcome any improvement in
                                Soviet-German relations. We think German signature of <pb n="141"
                                    xml:id="pg_141" facs="0174"/>the Non-Proliferation Treaty will
                                assist this and we hope that the Soviets will be able to give
                                Chancellor Kiesinger any help you may consider feasible to enable
                                him to get the treaty adopted. Meanwhile as we have told Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and Deputy
                                Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> in
                                Washington, we believe early completion of the ratification process
                                by the major nuclear powers, including simultaneous deposit of
                                instruments of ratification, would be helpful in bringing about the
                                widest possible endorsement of the treaty which we both seek. On
                                Berlin, we are prepared to examine any way to improve the present
                                unsatisfactory situation, and the President believes from his recent
                                talks with the Germans that they are prepared to do so too. But this
                                cannot be done under pressure. Perhaps some quiet exchanges would
                                show the way.</item>

                            <item>On strategic arms talks, it should be stressed that we are not
                                deliberately stalling; we are seriously reviewing our position,
                                something the President feels he is obligated to do as head of the
                                new Administration. We are not setting pre-conditions. But we want
                                the talks to succeed once they begin and for that reason we feel
                                that prospects for progress will be better in the context of
                                generally improved US–Soviet relations. If you have some substantive
                                ideas to convey to the President through me, he would be
                                interested.</item>

                                instructions to the members of the Administration to avoid harsh
                                words about the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The President
                                will, of course, state our views but he sees nothing gained by
                                “shouting.” At the same time the residue of suspicion of the <gloss

                                those in Czechoslovakia had a profound shock effect. We should
                                cooperate to preserve the present low key in our discourse with and
                                about each other.</item>

                            <item>We believe our relations will improve as we gain a better
                                understanding of each others' aspirations, problems, and concerns.
                                It is for this reason that the United States Government strongly
                                supports a free flow of information and ideas between our two
                                peoples. We would hope that we could work toward this objective by
                                expanding by mutual agreement the exchange program which we have
                                carried on for a number of years. Both sides should do what they can
                                to remove existing barriers to the free flow of information and in
                                this connection it is our hope that in due time the Soviet
                                authorities will find it possible to cease jamming the Voice of
                                America which was reimposed after the events of last summer.</item>

                            <item>The President has asked me to say that he fully understands your

                                judgment—he has been seeking to act on that judgment in our

                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he had been
                                unable to read the letter because of his preoccupation with current
                                CEMA meeting. He was nevertheless probably acquainted with its
                                contents since translations were on his desk. Wishing doubtless to
                                reserve his considered reply he confined himself to stating the
                                Soviet view which was particularly rough on the South Vietnamese
                                Govt. I responded on a number of points with citations from the

                                    corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> noted that Soviet people
                                are in general well disposed to American people, esteem their
                                science and technology, and respect them. He observed that our
                                relations have had their ups and downs but that despite accumulated
                                and inherited difficulties he hoped for close cooperation with US

                            <item>In concurring with these remarks, I noted that differences in our
                                economic organization and social systems are likely to persist but
                                that it is nevertheless in our mutual interest to limit dangers of
                                world in which we live. I observed that President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is a close student of
                                international affairs and is especially interested in the <gloss

                                desires we engage in continuing and rational talks about bilateral
                                and world problems through all feasible channels, including possibly
                                reciprocal visits of important officials. I said that as stressed in
                                President's letter we are interested in having productive and
                                practical discussions on concrete problems and are hopeful that this
                                approach to our relations will bring positive results.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said that he would be
                                preoccupied for several days with the CEMA summit meeting, which he
                                described as a “search for ways to achieve improved economic
                                cooperation” among Socialist countries. He also commented in passing
                                that “contrary to reports in Western press” this meeting is totally
                                unrelated to the “Chinese question.”</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then stated that he
                                hoped our two governments could find constructive solutions to
                                outstanding problems in a businesslike atmosphere free of
                                sensationalism. He said he thought it might be wise to identify
                                problems to which we should seek solutions, and he then brought up
                                in turn <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, Middle East, Vietnam
                                and Europe.</item>

                            <item>On <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> observed that treaty
                                represents a joint effort which should now be brought to a
                                conclusion. He suggested that we concert efforts to see that
                                “certain countries” do not interfere with realization of objectives
                                of treaty. I observed that if all three nuclear powers do not ratify
                                treaty it may prove impossible to induce signature and ratification
                                by other powers. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> did
                                not react to this remark nor did he indicate attitude of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SOVGOV1">SovGov</gloss> to our proposal for joint
                                ratification.</item>

                            <item>On Middle East, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                                said vigorously that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> desires
                                “greatly” to cooperate with US in reaching a settlement. He
                                commented that by “uniting our strengths” we could achieve such a
                                settlement. He said that he would not go into detail on this subject
                                but wished to observe that aggressors should be punished, not
                                encouraged. He also referred to circles in United States who seek an
                                “unbalanced” (that is, a pro-Israel) solution. In my answering
                                remarks, I said that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> believes both our countries must be willing to
                                accept burdens of bringing peace to area. I also noted that we have
                                been encouraged by talks now underway and hope they will eventually
                                assist <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                mission.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> expressed himself at
                                greater length and with most vehemence on subject of Vietnam.
                                Emphasizing that he speaking for himself and not on behalf of Hanoi.
                                His main target was the <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>
                                govt, which he repeatedly characterized as a corrupt puppet regime
                                lacking popular support, dictatorial in character and
                                unrepresentative of <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0177"/>people
                                of South Vietnam. He criticized lack of progress in Paris talks,
                                comparing them to unfruitful US–Chinese talks in Warsaw and
                                referring somewhat sardonically to “formal” proceedings which had
                                not yet got to heart of matter. He said that Soviet policy is still
                                directed to objective of stopping the war and added that he is
                                convinced this is also objective of Vietnamese. He said he was also
                                prepared accept judgment that US shares this objective. It was
                                therefore imperative for progress to be made toward a settlement
                                since another interested power, and he mentioned China by name,
                                could potentially use its influence against a settlement and in
                                manner to increase tensions throughout Southeast Asia. He stressed
                                that those interested in reaching a settlement must seek some
                                practical “informal” approach to problem but admitted that he could
                                not now identify such an approach.</item>

                            <item>In my response I remarked that I regretted to note that our
                                interpretations of situation in Vietnam were so far apart. I stated
                                that the Republic of Vietnam has a democratic strong govt with
                                substantial international recognition. I also read aloud to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> portion of
                                President's letter stressing his desire to achieve peace and his
                                hope that Soviet influence can be brought to bear to this end. (It
                                is obvious that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s
                                remarks offer little new on subject of Vietnam, but is equally
                                apparent that he is concerned that talks in Paris are not making
                                progress and that he views Chinese role in area as both
                                unpredictable and sinister.)</item>

                                wished to confine himself to a brief restatement on Soviet position.
                                He asserted that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seeks to
                                avoid tension in area, citing recent diminution of tensions in

                                absolutely firm in position that it will not tolerate any revision
                                of “results of World War II.” He called Soviet obligations in this
                                respect “sacred.” I said that I would not address myself to European
                                questions since I believed President's letter covered subject

                                asked me to transmit to President interim message that Soviet
                                leaders wish to establish relations with United States on a basis of
                                honesty and realism. He said that Soviet leaders believe it
                                important that Soviet and American peoples achieve satisfaction of
                                knowing that they are not threatened by the other. Each side
                                possesses an enormous arsenal. In our approach to mutual relations
                                there is no room for insincerity. He asked me to extend personal
                                greetings to the President and to tell him that in due course he
                                will answer his letter, which he would also of course share with

                            the strategic arms talks. He said that the Soviet leadership had been
                            disturbed by the speculation in the American press to the effect that
                            because of economic pressure the Soviet Government was eager for the
                            talks to begin and that over a month ago he had been instructed not to
                            raise the question of talks on his own initiative with anyone and had
                            not done so. When I said I was optimistic that we could reach agreement
                            he replied that he had thought so too but had changed his mind. He
                            thought that as a result of the delay in starting the talks and the
                            attempt to charge the Soviets with building for a first strike he
                            thought that there was great suspicion and distrust in Moscow of our
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>I explained at some length the thoroughness of the review the U.S.
                            Government was undertaking of the problem and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he could understand
                            this but indicated he had not convinced Moscow. In this connection he
                            mentioned the leak of the <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName>
                            study which added to the difficulty and said that this was something
                            that even he could not understand.</p>
                        <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0181"/>
                        <p>He asked whether in the talks we would propose a reduction or a freeze,
                            whether we would go for parity or insist upon superiority and how we
                            would define strategic.</p>
                        <p>I began my reply by saying that the whole question of our position at the
                            talks was under review and I could therefore only give him my personal
                            views. I thought it would be foolish of both of us to go for parity in
                            every category as this would probably amount to escalation since one of
                            us in each case would have to destroy weapons or systems which would be
                            difficult as a way to reach a first agreement, although reductions could
                            be considered later. I did think that our position would be based on an
                            overall balance between us.</p>
                        <p>I evaded answering his question on our definition of strategic weapons
                            but did mention that in the case of airplanes this was very difficult.
                            He observed that in the present situation airplanes were not very
                            important.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of delay I said the Secretary had asked me to tell him that
                            he hoped to be in a position to discuss the matter of date and place
                            with him before he left on his trip the beginning of next week.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expressed his hope
                            this would be possible.</p>
                        <p>I tried to draw <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> out on
                            the Soviet position in the talks. He said he had been familiar with the
                            position that had worked out for the previously proposed talks. He said
                            this position laid down general principles and objectives but did not go
                            into specifics. He explained that this would be done after the talks had
                            opened and they had a better idea of what kind of agreement we had in
                            mind. I had earlier mentioned that one reason for the considerable time
                            we were taking to develop our position was that the President liked to
                            have several options explored in depth. He said the Politburo did not
                            normally operate in this way. Papers usually come to the Politburo in a
                            form that enabled issues to be decided by a yes or no. Of course the
                            members had to do a lot of homework on the agenda before the meeting. He
                            said an agenda might have as many as sixty items on it. On a complicated
                            issue like <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> the members could not
                            be expected to form opinions on all the specific issues that might
                            theoretically arise in the talks but the delegation could get
                            instructions on these as they came up.</p>
                        <p>At one point <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if the
                            problem of Communist China would affect our position in the talks. I
                            said my guess was that we would have an open mind on this and would give
                            careful consideration to any points they might wish to raise. I said he
                            would be aware from the discussion in our press that one argument for an
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> system was that it would be
                            useful against a Chinese attack even though such an attack in the
                            foreseeable future would be irrational. He inquired when we thought the
                            Chinese Communist would have ICBMs. <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149"
                                facs="0182"/>When I hesitated in replying he suggested not until in
                            the 1970s and I said I thought this was our view.</p>
                        <p>One interesting remark by <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            was that my job as Ambassador had been easier than his. I had only to
                            convince the Secretary and the President of a given position. In his
                            case although <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was the
                            boss, even if he and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            accepted his position, if the other members of the Politburo did not
                            agree that position would not be adopted. Therefore on his trips to
                            Moscow for consultation he had to talk to all of the Politburo members
                            and convince a majority of them in order to put across his point of
                            view. I pointed out that in the case of the President he had Congress to
                            consider. He admitted that this was true but thought the President could
                            prevail in most cases where it was important to him.</p>
                        <p>I started to raise the question of Vietnam but at this point the ladies
                            came in and his wife insisted on their going home as the hour was
                            late.</p>
                        <p>Before parting <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he
                            needed something to show that the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> Administration sincerely wanted to enter into an
                            era of negotiation with the Soviet Union and in that connection even a
                            small step in advance would help. It was for that reason he had raised
                            with the Secretary the matter of their opening a consulate in San
                            Francisco in return for one for us in Leningrad. I gathered he had done
                            this without specific instruction to do so.</p>

                            the Chinese missile and atomic test range and asked whether the Soviet
                            Ambassador was aware of their construction. <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"

                        <p>“<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> gave me the impression
                            he had already heard of these installations as he did not seem at all
                            surprised at my raising the subject. He asked how large they were. When
                            I said I simply did not recall <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0183"
                            />what our estimate of size was he pressed me further and asked if they
                            were around a mile long. I said my guess was that a quarter or eighth of
                            a mile was more like it. He asked about width of the internal structure
                            and I said I could only recall that they were narrow—perhaps about six
                            feet. In reply to his question I said the orientation of the facilities
                            appeared to be random. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said he would get in touch with his Government about the matter.”

                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> explained the following US
                            proposals: —a settlement would be based on the UN resolution,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d44fn3">UN Resolution 242; see <ref target="#d2fn4">footnote
                                    4, Document 2</ref>.</note> the settlement would be a package, a
                            formal state of peace would exist, all claims or states of belligerency
                            would end including terrorist raids, and the parties would agree to
                            abide by the UN charter in settling future disputes. These are points 1,
                            2, 3, 6, 7 of our draft document; 4 and 5 deal with withdrawal and
                            borders.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not comment directly
                            on any single item. He said Moscow would have to examine our entire
                            document before giving a positive reply, and what <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> had given him so far left out the
                            key issues for the entire settlement—borders and withdrawal. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> felt that the US may have
                            misunderstood the Soviet position on borders. They want withdrawal to
                            pre-war lines, but have no objections if the parties want to change
                            their borders. So far, the US document reflected the views of only one
                            side—the Israelis—and if there is no more substance in our other points,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> thinks we will be
                            back where we were two months ago.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> seemed to be
                            taking a harder line than usual towards our proposals, he may just have
                            wanted to make it clear that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            will want to put its own ideas into the preliminary agreement instead of
                            making minor changes in the US plan.</p>
                        <p>They are meeting again today (Thursday). I will have a fuller report on
                            this meeting when you get back to Washington.<note n="4" xml:id="d44fn4"

                            generally negative, do not spell out what peace is, and contain no
                            positive Arab obligation to peace. (Comment: Joe rebutted by pointing to
                            a number of such obligations, including that to control the fedayeen.)
                            He also felt that the entire approach demonstrated that the four power
                            and two power talks are designed to avoid negotiations between the
                            parties.</p>

                            television through a Telstar hookup. It was not the Secretary's
                            intention to press the Soviets to fix a date now for such joint
                            ceremonies, but he did feel if we could reach agreement in principle,
                            leaving the date open, it would be helpful to us in our planning. It was
                            the President's view that joint action by our two countries would give

                            would be helpful now if the Secretary could give a more specific
                            indication as to his own ideas on modalities, particularly timing. The
                            Secretary said that on timing he was not really able to go beyond what
                            he said before—i.e., early summer. With regard to place, the Secretary
                            understood that Geneva had been suggested informally as a suitable
                            location and he assumed that this would not give the Soviets a problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                            question of place, he felt, was secondary and while he could not give a
                            definitive answer, he believed that Geneva might be an acceptable
                            location. The important thing, however, was to fix an opening date and
                            he would look forward to his talk with the Secretary when he returned
                            from the Far East.</p>

                                    that it would be hard to put this contradiction into a document,

                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that it
                                    was unrealistic to demilitarize all areas vacated. He could not
                                    accept <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s idea that
                                    the greater the DMZ the more likely Israel would be to withdraw.

                            of the acquisition of territory by war, the need to establish a just and

                            explained that we see this as meaning that there must be direct
                            negotiations at some point. Hypothetically, if both parties accept the
                            US–Soviet document there would only be specific details to work out.

                            we are interested in a truly combined enterprise with the Soviets. He
                            said we have no assurance Israel will accept the document, and its
                            success or failure would depend on whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> can get the UAR to make the necessary commitments and
                            concessions. Even if negotiations begin, we and the Soviets would have

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s preliminary impression
                            was that the US had left out the most important question—withdrawal and
                            boundaries. All of Israel's demands are clearly stated, but not points
                            important to the Arabs. The UAR reaction will be negative. The <gloss

                            primary emphasis should be in Washington. The talks in New York should

                                <item>—As you know, I will make a Vietnam speech tonight. The speech
                                    has been painstakingly prepared, and is the product of many
                                    months of intensive personal study and thought.</item>
                                <item>—The proposals I will make tonight set forth what I consider
                                    to be the general principles of a settlement that both sides can
                                    accept.</item>
                                <item>—If we can end this war, it will encourage friendly
                                    cooperation between our two countries. I am willing to move
                                    forward on a broad front including talks at the highest levels
                                    and expansion of trade. But an end of the war in Vietnam is the
                                    key.</item>
                                <item>—If we cannot end this war, we will continue to maintain as
                                    close relations with the Soviet Union as possible, but clearly
                                    the ending of the Vietnamese war will be our overriding
                                    concern.</item>
                                <item>—As <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry</persName> told you
                                    earlier, a failure to achieve a reasonable Vietnam settlement
                                    can only mean that we will have to take whatever steps are
                                    necessary to bring it to a successful conclusion. We are
                                    determined to end this war one way or another.</item>
                                <item>—We both know how this would affect relations between our two
                                    countries.</item>

                                    settlement should cover all the countries, but so far only a
                                    UAR–Israel settlement had been discussed. He asked what we
                                    planned for Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                                    told him that we feel the best place to begin is with the UAR,
                                    but we doubt that an Egyptian settlement can be implemented
                                    without a Jordanian settlement. We are not trying for a separate
                                    UAR–Israel settlement, but cannot give specific ideas on a
                                    Jordan settlement now. [The Russians know the Egyptians will

                        <p>What is happening here is that Rusk, in talking with <persName

                            specific on withdrawal. We have, for bargaining purposes, been less
                            specific. The Russians in December must have told the UAR they thought
                            they could produce US agreement to full Israeli withdrawal from the
                            Sinai. They obviously sent <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> back to find out whether we're just bargaining
                            or have changed our substantive position, since they're now getting

                            with our current proposals. The Soviets may be thinking more of Rusk's
                            “Seven Points” which he gave to Egyptian Foreign Minister <persName

                                    but as you know have avoided being that specific about a return

                                    than in our current proposal. This is not a change in our

                                xml:id="d50fn2">A <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on

                            decisions on East-West trade issues. I have only been intermittently
                            involved in the preparatory work for the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting, so that I am not familiar with the factors and
                            considerations that led up to this rather major decision in the area of
                            East-West relations.</p>
                        <p>But I consider it unfortunate that the Executive appears to have
                            surrendered a flexible instrument of policy vis-à-vis the East. I have
                            never believed that our trade (and cultural) policies will have more
                            than marginal impact on the evolution of Soviet policy. On the other
                            hand, I find it surprising that we should want to let the Soviets (and,
                            for that matter, the North Koreans and North Vietnamese) control our
                            policy toward all the Communist states of Eastern Europe. I believe that
                            the policy of treating different Communists differently, if pursued
                            without <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0194"/>illusion and grandiose
                            expectations, is a wise one. But there is little, if anything, that we
                            can do in practice to implement it if we deprive ourselves of just about
                            the only instrument we have for doing so.</p>
                        <p>If the intention is to hold out lush vistas of trade as an incentive for
                            the Soviets to cross the threshold of “sufficient progress” it is
                            doubtful that we will be successful. The Soviets are unlikely to
                            consider the potential economic benefits of sufficient interest to
                            warrant political concessions; and since our present policy supports
                            their own efforts to rebuild a monolith in Eastern Europe, they will
                            hardly be inclined to pay us in order to get us to give it up.</p>
                        <p>More fundamentally, I find disturbing the apparent decision, as I
                            understand it, to withhold a “generous” Eastern trade policy until there
                            is “sufficient progress” in our “overall relations” with the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that this implies a concept of our relations with the
                            Soviets that can lead us into serious difficulty. The notion that there
                            is some definable threshold between insufficient and sufficient
                            progress—between confrontation and negotiation—is unrealistic. The
                            prospect is for a highly mixed relationship with elements of both. The
                            attached paper attempts to sketch some of the reasons why this is
                            so.</p>
                        <p>If we think of our relations with the Soviets in terms of milestones and
                            thresholds, we run the risk of arbitrarily proclaiming great new eras of
                            cooperation—much as President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> did for subjective reasons of his own in
                            connection with the most marginal housekeeping agreements or with a
                            summit of the most dubious achievement—when in fact little that was
                            fundamental had changed. We should not forget President Eisenhower's
                            experience with his speech of April 16, 1953,<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3"
                                >Eisenhower's address, “The Chance For Peace,” was delivered before
                                the American Society of Newspaper Editors. (<hi rend="italic">Public
                                    Papers: Eisenhower, 1953</hi>, pp. 179–188)</note> in which he
                            established certain litmus paper tests for Soviet good behavior. After
                            the Soviets had met some of them (like the Austrian peace treaty) it
                            nevertheless turned out that we were small, if any, distance farther
                            along in improving “overall relations.”</p>
                        <p>In sum, rather than conditioning our minds and hopes to a vision of a
                            relationship with the Soviets that is moving in one consistent direction
                            of progress, we should anticipate that <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss> and pepper will mark these relations for a long time
                            to come. If the past is any guide at all, the landmarks we are likely to
                            pass will not be ones of progress in overall relations as much as lines

                            <p>If one had to summarize the view from Moscow in a word, it would be
                                “uncertainty.” Whether considering their internal situation or
                                surveying the external scene, the Soviet leaders must see a number
                                of problems and issues that are increasingly difficult and complex.
                                Even if the collective leadership were disposed to be more decisive,
                                which it is not, there are too many variables that impinge on their
                                calculations and over which they have only limited control and
                                influence.</p>
                            <p>A case might be made that the several pressures and uncertainties
                                with which Soviet leaders must cope may dispose them to seek
                                quiescence in their relations with us. Yet, for the most part these
                                pressures cut several ways, leading the Soviets into policy lines
                                that impede improved relations with us.</p>

                            <p>This problem is at the center of Soviet preoccupation because it
                                affects almost every other area of decision. The build-up which the
                                Soviets have made in the Far East will, by the end of this year,
                                have created stronger ground forces than the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has in Eastern Europe; this has
                                been and will be extremely costly, especially as the Russians create
                                tactical nuclear capabilities along the China border. This is an
                                entirely new aspect to the traditional squeeze on Soviet
                                military-economic resources, and one which Moscow should logically
                                want to alleviate.</p>
                            <p>Yet the Soviets find it difficult to cope with the China problem. The
                                results of the Chinese party congress offer little hope for the
                                future, if Lin Piao<note n="5" xml:id="d50fn5">Lin Pao was Minister

                                above all, would seem to call for a much more stabilized
                                relationship with the US and the West in general.</p>

                            <p>There are significant barriers, however, to moving very far in this
                                direction.</p>

                            <p>The Soviets would prefer a tight, cohesive, ideologically orthodox
                                Warsaw Pact. But the two recent “summit” meetings exposed once again
                                the enormous problems of recreating such an alliance, without
                                provoking the gravest crises; meanwhile, Rumania remains determined
                                to create an independent position, and receives aid and comfort from
                                Tito, whose relations with Moscow are deteriorating.</p>
                            <p>Much the same applies to the international communist movement, which
                                will gather in Moscow on May 29 to prepare for the grand conclave of
                                June 5. The Soviets would like, of course, to lay down a new
                                “general line” on major issues—the imperialist threat, the Chinese,
                                the “<persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine,”<note

                                    August 1968. In a speech on November 11, 1968, Soviet Premier
                                        <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Leonid Brezhnev</persName>
                                    declared that a threat to Socialist rule in any state of the
                                    East European bloc constituted a threat to all and therefore
                                    “must engage the attention of all the Socialist states.”</note>
                                the character of the international movement, etc. But sharp clear
                                positions are almost certain to provoke a showdown with the
                                dissident parties. So the result is likely to be a compromise which
                                will settle very little.</p>
                            <p>And in the background is Czechoslovakia. The situation there is, of
                                course, improved from the Soviet viewpoint. But they are not out of
                                the woods by any means. To the extent that Husak<note n="7"

                                resistance. Yet if and as he succeeds, his strong personality and
                                sharp nationalist sentiments may confront Moscow with yet further

                            <p>The net result is that the Soviets are reluctant to see a significant

                            <p>At the same time, the Soviets recognize the attraction of “détente”
                                politics in the West, and still intend to play this line. The

                                already evidenced some concern over possible departures from the

                            <p>The principal Soviet concern, however, is whether the political
                                weight of Bonn does not automatically gain as de Gaulle leaves the
                                scene. Relations with Bonn, in any case, have been ambiguous. The
                                Soviets are tempted to promote a “dialogue,” especially while the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> is in the Grand Coalition,
                                and even open up the Berlin question. Recent trade overtures and
                                agreements with German industry also point in this direction. Any
                                extensive dialogue, however, creates problems for Moscow's relations
                                with East Germany and Poland. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                    >NPT</gloss> issue is a source of tensions between Bonn and
                                Moscow. While the Soviets have now decided to start the ratification
                                process, they will still withhold the final steps until the Germans
                                sign, which probably means after the German elections. Thus, the
                                issue may become acrimonious and an issue in German politics in
                                which the Soviets will try to involve themselves. It may also
                                complicate relations with us.</p>

                            <p>On the Middle East, the Soviets have recognized the explosiveness of
                                the situation and the need for a breathing spell; hence their
                                interest in the four-power discussions and their fairly flexible
                                approach. But the question remains whether they believe a breather
                                is all that is necessary, or that a more durable settlement is
                                required. In the latter case, they would have to consider the cost
                                to their position in the Arab World of trying to reach a mutually
                                acceptable compromise. It is unlikely that they have faced the hard
                                decisions on the Middle East, since they do not seem to share our

                                stalling, in expectation that domestic pressures in the US will
                                force new concessions in Paris. On the other hand, they may
                                recognize that Vietnam <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0198"
                                />casts a shadow over relations with the US and may stand in the way
                                of proceeding on other issues. The Soviets may also be concerned
                                that the lack of progress in Paris vindicates the Chinese criticism
                                and reduces Moscow's influence in Hanoi. But Vietnam is still a
                                critical issue over which the Soviets have limited leverage and no

                            <p>Apparently, the uncertainties over Vietnam and the Middle East are
                                reinforced by doubts over relations with the US. The Soviets have
                                been notably patient about the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>
                                talks and fairly calm in their criticism of the US <gloss
                                    target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> decision. They have also been
                                moderately positive in evaluating the new American administration.
                                And <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in his keynote
                                speech on May Day seemed restrained.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, the Soviets may have suspicions that the US is
                                improving its military position and attaching “preconditions” to
                                arms control talks.</p>

                            <p>That there is a greater uncertainty seems to be reflected in evidence
                                of a debate over military affairs. The military seem to be arguing
                                among themselves over weapons programs, including <gloss

                                should have the last word on professional military decisions.
                                Civilian control is almost certainly not in danger, but concessions
                                to military pleading, say for new weapons programs, may affect the
                                political leaders' attitude toward <gloss target="#t_SALT1"

                            </p>
                            <p>These issues have been sharpened by the need to begin preparations
                                for the new Five Year Plan (1971–75). The Soviets are not facing an
                                acute economic crisis; nor are they faced with simple choices of
                                guns versus butter. The problems are more complex. The main one is
                                how to increase the rate of investment for future growth, which is
                                almost certain to decline further if investment rates are not
                                increased.</p>
                            <p>Eventually, enough political leaders may conclude that they should
                                cut into the military pie, which is probably exactly what the
                                marshals fear and are trying to head off in their contentious
                                articles of late.</p>
                            <p>While it can be argued that economic pressures push the Soviets in
                                the direction of a détente with the United States, social dissidence
                                and internal unrest draw the Soviet leaders into an increasingly
                                repressive, authoritarian mode of behavior. Some very ugly features
                                of the Soviet leadership are more and more apparent. Historically,
                                such trends in internal affairs are linked to a more defensive but
                                militant attitude toward the outside world.</p>

                            <p>All of the foregoing does not add up to a crisis. Nor does it suggest
                                a more belligerent, forward policy abroad. Probably the leadership
                                will continue to manage, rather than solve, its principal problems,
                                and do so in the businesslike fashion which has characterized the
                                collective in Moscow since they assumed power.</p>
                            <p>From our standpoint, this may offer some opportunities. If the Soviet
                                leaders seem to be temporizing and are rather uncertain, then there
                                may be room for the US to influence decisions, especially on the
                                critical issues—the Middle East, Vietnam, and disarmament.</p>
                            <p>From the standpoint of the Kremlin, however, there may be those who
                                are impatient with a leadership which seems increasingly tired. A
                                change at the top, before the party congress next spring could be
                                one outcome. Another could be the development of a new “general
                                line” after the Communist conference, which is the next major
                                landmark which should provide us with considerable material for a
                                better view of Moscow's foreign policy direction.</p>

                                about the crucial importance of finding solutions for Vietnam and

                                might postpone a general improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations or of
                                the international situation as a whole, and could create a vicious
                                circle.”</note> It is clear that the Soviet leaders want to <pb

                        <p>However, while the tone is civil and constructive, I detect no
                            substantive concessions. But none were to be expected in this general
                            sort of communication, just as your own letter contained general
                            considerations rather than specific new offers of substance.</p>

                            closely, although he recognizes a certain interrelationship. In
                            principle, this is not too different from your position, and I see no
                            need for arguing this issue further with the Soviets. We should simply

                                    is probably due (1) to their desire not to seem too eager and
                                    (2) their wanting to watch the outcome of our domestic debates
                                    to see whether we might be forced into unilateral

                            <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                            <p>I and my colleagues have attentively familiarized ourselves with your
                                message, and also the additional considerations conveyed by
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>.</p>
                            <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0202"/>
                            <p>We have received with satisfaction confirmation by you of the idea of
                                the necessity of entering into an era of negotiations and of
                                readiness to examine any possible path for the settlement of
                                international problems, in particular of those which are connected
                                with the danger of a clash and of conflicts.</p>
                            <p>This accords with our opinion, already expressed earlier to you, on
                                the importance of achieving a situation in which negotiations would
                                serve first of all to avert conflicts, and not to seek for ways out
                                of them after peace and international security have been placed in
                                jeopardy.</p>
                            <p>Such a task is completely feasible if our two countries with their
                                resources and influence will act in the direction of maintaining and
                                consolidating peace, with due consideration of each other's
                                fundamental interests and without setting themselves against third
                                countries. At the same time it is important not to permit anyone to
                                exert pernicious influence on Soviet-American relations.</p>
                            <p>The achievement of mutual understanding in this matter is all the
                                more necessary since our countries must take into account the
                                character and degree of influence on the international situation
                                also of other forces. From this point of view much that can be done
                                now, given mutual desire, and setting aside complicating (kon
                                yunturnye) questions, may turn out with the passage of time either
                                to be fully unattainable of much more difficult and complex.</p>
                            <p>As far as can be judged by your statements, in principle we have with
                                you a common understanding in this regard. It is a matter now,
                                perhaps, of embarking on the practical realization of such an
                                understanding, on a search for ways and means of resolving concrete
                                problems which burden international relations at the present time
                                and are fraught with great dangers for the future.</p>
                            <p>In this regard, it seems to us, that, taking into account the
                                complexity of each of these problems by itself, it is hardly
                                worthwhile to attempt somehow to link one with another. Although it
                                is indisputable that progress in solving each problem taken
                                individually would facilitate the solving also of other problems, it
                                would be unjustified in our view to draw from this a conclusion
                                about the advisability of making the solution of one problem
                                dependent on the solution of any other problem or of postponing in
                                general their examination until there is some sort of general
                                improvement in Soviet-American relations or in the international
                                situation as a whole. Such a posing of the question would inevitably
                                lead to the emergence of a vicious circle and would in no way
                                facilitate the solving of problems which have become ripe for
                                this.</p>
                            <p>We have already transmitted to you through Ambassador <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> our observations on a

                                the following thoughts.</p>

                                <label>(1)</label>

                                    <p>As facts show, the situation in the Near East is becoming
                                        more and more exacerbated by virtue of the <hi rend="italic"
                                            >continuity</hi> lack of settlement of the conflict in
                                        this region. Without going into a detailed discussion of
                                        this question here, with which our representatives are now
                                        occupied, I would only like to emphasize our conviction that
                                        in the working out of any plans for a Near Eastern
                                        settlement, the strict observance of the main principle is
                                        necessary—aggression must not be rewarded. Without this
                                        there can be no firm and lasting peace in the Near East.</p>
                                    <p>As we understand it, the Government of the USA assesses
                                        seriously the situation which has been created, and
                                        therefore we hope that it will devote efforts to exert the
                                        necessary influence on Israel, which stubbornly does not
                                        wish to take a realistic position and which ignores the
                                        dangerous consequences of its annexationist course.</p>
                                    <p>For our part, we intend to continue, in the framework of a
                                        bilateral Soviet-American exchange of views and of the
                                        consultations of the representatives of the four powers in
                                        New York, to use every opportunity to secure real progress
                                        in the matter of a just settlement of the Near Eastern
                                        conflict in conformity with the November 22, 1967, Security
                                        Council Resolution.<note n="8" xml:id="d51fn8">See <ref

                                    <p>As regards the question raised by you about limiting outside
                                        military assistance to countries of the Near East, in
                                        principle we advocate the limitation of an unnecessary arms
                                        race in the Near East and we assume that appropriate steps
                                        in this direction would not contradict the interests of
                                        countries of this region. We believe that this question
                                        could be examined on a practical plane after the realization
                                        of a political settlement, including the withdrawal by
                                        Israel of its troops from occupied Arab territories.</p>

                                    <p>It causes regret and concern to us that real progress in the
                                        direction of a political settlement in Vietnam still has not
                                        been noted in the negotiations in Paris.</p>
                                    <p>The Soviet Union, just as earlier, is ready to facilitate
                                        such a settlement. However, I will say frankly: the American
                                        side itself is complicating the possibility of rendering
                                        this assistance by its obviously unrealistic position in
                                        such a fundamental question as the question of the South

                                        expresses the desire to stop the armed conflict, then it
                                        would seem self-evident that the present Administration in
                                        Saigon must give way to a government which reflects the
                                        actual disposition of political forces in <pb n="171"

                                        with the question of creating in South Vietnam a temporary
                                        coalition government is, without question, a decisive one.
                                        It has now become completely obvious already that if one
                                        strives for a halt in the war in Vietnam then it is
                                        impossible to continue to bank on the present Saigon

                                    <p>We fully share the view on the necessity of averting crises
                                        and of eliminating threats to peace in Europe. In this
                                        connection we attach special importance to the understanding
                                        with the Soviet Government, expressed earlier by you Mr.
                                        President, that the foundations of the postwar system in
                                        Europe should not be changed, inasmuch as this could cause
                                        great upheavals and the danger of a clash among great
                                        powers.</p>
                                    <p>For our part, we are not interested in the creation of
                                        tension in Europe, including West Berlin. If such tensions
                                        emerges from time to time, then the responsibility for it is
                                        borne by those forces in Western Germany which oppose the
                                        foundations of the post-war system in Europe, which attempt
                                        to undermine these foundations, and in particular which come
                                        out with totally unjustified claims with respect to West
                                        Berlin. There are no objections from our side to an exchange
                                        of opinions proposed by you concerning ways of improving the
                                        present unsatisfactory situation with West Berlin.</p>
                                    <p>We, Mr. President, are not at all against an improvement also
                                        of Soviet-West German relations. And the practical steps
                                        which have been undertaken by us in this direction are
                                        obviously known to you. Unfortunately, however, in the
                                            <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> the understanding
                                        still has not apparently matured that its relations with
                                        other countries, including those with the <gloss
                                            target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, cannot be developed
                                        apart from the general foreign policy course of Bonn. And
                                        the fact that this course still is based on these which are
                                        contrary to the goals of strengthening European security and
                                        world peace is confirmed in particular by the attitude of
                                        the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> toward the treaty on
                                        the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. After all, it is
                                        precisely the stubborn refusal of Western Germany to accede
                                        to the treaty—with whatever contrived pretext it fortifies
                                        itself—which greatly impedes its entry into force. We hope
                                        that the United States is using its influence in order to
                                        secure the most rapid accession to the treaty by the <gloss
                                            target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and by a number of other
                                        countries allied with the USA. As regards the ratification
                                        of the treaty by the Soviet Union, the matter is not up to
                                        us (to za nami delo nye stanet).</p>

                                        mention in your message of events in Czechoslovakia is all
                                        the more incomprehensible. As we have already noted earlier,
                                        these events concern first of all Czechoslovakia itself, and
                                        also its relations with other participating states of the
                                        Warsaw Pact and their security, including the security of

                                        in any way affect the state interests of the USA.</p>
                                    <p>In conclusion, I would like once again to stress our
                                        readiness to develop relations with the USA in a
                                        constructive plane on the basis of mutual confidence and
                                        frankness. In this connection, we consider useful the
                                        practice which has developed of a confidential exchange of
                                        views on topical international problems and on questions of
                                        Soviet-American relations. In this regard we agree with you,
                                        Mr. President, that in different situations—depending on the
                                        character of the questions and on other considerations—one
                                        must apply different forms and utilize various channels for
                                        such an exchange of views.</p>

                                    Washington, or to circumvent them by asking Khrushchev directly.
                                    (As you may know, the present leaders have bridled at previous
                                    attempts by prominent Americans to contact Khrushchev.)</item>

                        <p>In general I recommend that you place the major emphasis in your plans on
                            the tenth anniversary of the first US national exhibit in Moscow and the
                            President's trip to the Soviet Union, rather than on the “Kitchen
                            Debate” per se. While we look back on the episode with a certain
                            nostalgia, the Soviets do not regard the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>–Khrushchev encounter as one of the high points in
                            Soviet-American relations. In fact the “Kitchen Debate” was associated
                            in the past with a strong anti-<persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> line in the Soviet press—now conveniently
                            forgotten. Because of these overtones, the Soviets might not even let
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> participate
                            unless we characterize the occasion as commemorating the President's
                            trip as a whole (rather than only the “Kitchen Debate”).</p>

                            discussions on the Arab-Israeli settlement problem and that it will
                            enable the Soviets to make a new presentation to the US in the near
                            future. There is other good evidence as well that this is the main

                            Although the evidence is sketchy regarding the extent of Moscow's

                            take in Washington, and that the trip does not signify Soviet
                            consternation over a totally negative UAR attitude toward further Soviet

                            there is every reason to believe that such consultations have continued
                            since then. The authoritative Cairo newspaper <hi rend="italic">Al

                            is also noteworthy that the four other Soviet officials who accompanied

                                >Gromyko</persName> trip to the <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            talks, went further, saying that the US had given the Soviets a
                            statement of US views, to which the Soviets were preparing a reply. If
                            so, the purpose of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s trip
                            would be to clear the new Soviet stand with the Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>The Cairo press has indicated UAR displeasure over the position taken by
                            the US in the US-Soviet discussions on the Middle East. It seems likely
                            that the Egyptians would not agree with any Soviet proposal to take the
                            US position as a point of departure for working out a new Soviet stand.
                            On the other hand, the Egyptian authorities would have trouble defending
                            the view with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that the
                            Soviets should reject US views out of hand and should only reiterate
                            existing Soviet positions, as this obviously would end the US-Soviet
                            discussions. Soviet-Egyptian differences undoubtedly exist, since
                            otherwise <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s trip would be
                            unnecessary. But these differences probably concern how far the Soviets
                            should go toward US views in their next presentation in the Washington
                            discussions, and not whether the Soviets should take any fresh position
                            at all. As long as <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> is
                            able to obtain Egyptian acquiescence on a new Soviet position for use
                            with the Americans which will contain enough movement to keep the
                            bilateral talks going, Moscow would probably consider the trip a
                            success.</p>

                            Secretary afternoon June 11 prior to his departure Moscow on urgent
                            consultation orders. Secretary raised Viet-Nam with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressing our disappointment
                            that <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0210"/>there had been no progress
                            in Paris in beginning private talks by the <gloss target="#t_GVN1"
                                >GVN</gloss> and NLF on political issues. Secretary reminded
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of his conversation
                            in March when he made clear that private talks on political issues could
                            be bilaterally between <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and NLF or in
                            four-power forum.<note n="2" xml:id="d55fn2">See <ref target="#d25"
                                    >Document 25</ref>.</note> Our only reservation was with regard
                            to private talks between US and NLF which we could not accept. This
                            remained our position and Secretary hoped that the Soviets would do what
                            they could to get talks underway.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he
                            understood position of NLF (which he referred to throughout conversation
                            as Provisional Revolutionary Government) to be that there could be no
                            discussion with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> unless Saigon
                            prepared to agree to coalition government beforehand. Secretary told
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that if NLF position
                            was that precondition to talks was removal of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_NCK1"
                                >Ky</persName>, this was totally unacceptable. As President had made
                            clear, composition of Saigon Government must be determined by electoral
                            process, and Secretary saw no reason why arrangements for elections
                            including appropriate supervision could not be proper subjects for
                            discussion in Paris in private talks, either bilaterally or with four.
                            Secretary could not understand how composition of possible coalition
                            government could be fixed before views of electorate known. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> rejoined that in NLF view free
                            choice impossible in presence foreign military forces and while Saigon
                            committed to continuation of war. Secretary said if NLF felt this way,
                            adequate guarantees free elections could be discussed in Paris, and he
                            saw no reason why Soviets themselves could not play role in supervisory
                            process. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reiterated NLF
                            position on coalition government and said that NLF felt strongly that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NCK1">Ky</persName> knew their political future depended
                            on continued presence of US forces and continuation of war, and it was
                            for this reason that they were opposed to commitment to coalition.
                            Secretary firmly rejected this thesis and said that, if other side
                            genuinely interested in peace, moves to replace US forces could be
                            reciprocated by North Vietnamese, and Soviets and their allies could
                            move to get Paris talks off dead center. Secretary reminded <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of past indications from Zorin
                            and Oberemko to US counterparts in Paris of NLF willingness to discuss
                            questions relating to political settlement in Viet-Nam and said that
                            other side seemed to be raising new and unacceptable preconditions for
                            such discussions.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had requested the
                            appointment to inform me that he had been recalled to Moscow for
                            consultations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> opened
                            the conversation by saying that he had been impressed by the
                            deliberateness and precision of the Administration. We had moved one
                            step at a time towards first establishing a general atmosphere, then
                            into the Middle East talks, then beginning some discussion on Vietnam
                            and only when the main outlines were set did we offer to have the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks. We had not been stampeded at
                            any point. He had reported accordingly to his government. He said the
                            Soviet Union preferred to deal with careful planners since they were
                            much more predictable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to Vietnam.
                            I told him that we were following a very careful policy. We had our
                            moves for the next few months fully worked out. I reminded him of what
                            the President had said when we gave him an advance copy of the Vietnam
                            speech. He should not be confused by the many statements that he heard.
                            We were not interfering with much that was being said. But the President
                            reserved the final decision on essential items. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that he had noticed
                            that we moved on about the schedule we had given him a month ago.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked about our
                            ideas for settling the war in Vietnam. He inquired especially on our
                            views on a coalition government. I said that he and I were both
                            realists. He knew very well that in order to bring about a coalition
                            government we would have to smash the present structure of the Saigon
                            Government while the NLF remained intact. This would guarantee an NLF
                            victory sooner or later. We would never accept that. We would agree to a
                            fair political con-test—not to what the President had called a disguised
                            defeat.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made no effort to defend
                            Hanoi's position. He replied that Hanoi was very difficult. He said I
                            could be sure that the Soviet Union had transmitted our discussion of
                            April and added a recommendation. <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179"
                                facs="0212"/>However, Hanoi believed that they knew their own
                            requirements better than the Soviet Union. I said, on the other hand,
                            the Soviet Union supplied 85% of the military equipment. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether we wanted the
                            Soviet Union to give Hanoi an ultimatum. I said it was not for me to
                            tell the Soviet Union how to conduct its relations with its allies. I
                            said that we were determined to have the war ended one way or another.
                            Hanoi was attempting to break down the President's public support. It
                            was too much to ask us to hold still for that. I added that what we
                            needed was some strategic help, not just negotiating devices for
                            settling particular problems as has been the case until now. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, who was very subdued, said I
                            could be sure that they are looking into the question.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me about
                            US-Soviet relations in general. I said that while some gradual progress
                            was possible even during the Vietnam war, a really massive change
                            depended on the settlement of the Vietnam war. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said we always seem to link
                            things. I replied that as a student of Marxism he must believe in the
                            importance of objective factors. It was an objective fact that Hanoi was
                            trying to undermine the President. It was an objective fact that we had
                            to look to every avenue for a solution. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> then said supposing the war were settled, how
                            would you go about improving relations.</p>
                        <p>I called his attention to the President's offer of increased trade and I
                            also suggested the possibility of a summit meeting. I said that they
                            could count on the same careful preparation for a summit meeting that
                            characterized all the President's efforts. One possibility would be to
                            have a meeting at which the major issues were discussed together with a
                            precise agenda for dealing with them, to be followed by periodic
                            meetings to resolve them. In this way we might reach a stage in which
                            war between the two major nuclear countries would become unthinkable,
                            and other countries which might be emerging could not disturb the peace
                            of the world. I added this should help the Soviets with some of their
                            allies. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that they
                            had no problem with any of their allies. I replied that China was still
                            a Soviet ally. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            emphatically said China is not an ally; it is our chief security
                            problem. He was very intrigued by the suggestion of a summit meeting and
                            I added that there was no prospect of it without a settlement of the
                            Vietnam war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the
                            Middle East. He said the Soviet Union was very interested in a
                                settlement—<persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> was always
                            speaking in the abstract about secure and recognized borders. The Soviet
                            Union was perfectly willing to discuss a rectification of the borders
                            even if it did not promise to agree right away. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was in Cairo to try to see how
                            much give there was in the Egyptian position. I said that if Vietnam
                            were settled, we could certainly give more top level attention to the
                            Middle East.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> returned to the theme of
                            US-Soviet relations and asked what he could tell his principals when he
                            returned. I said that everything depended on the war in Vietnam. If the
                            war were ended, he could say that there was no limit to what might be
                            accomplished. You would like to be remembered as a President who ensured
                            a permanent peace and a qualitative change in international relations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether we
                            were expecting a change in the Moscow leadership. I replied that we had
                            no intention of playing domestic politics in the Kremlin. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said: “Don't believe your
                            Soviet experts; they understand nothing.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked whether I
                            might be willing to come to Moscow sometime very quietly to explain your
                            thinking to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>. I told <persName

                            discussed with you but that if it were for the right issue, you would
                            almost certainly entertain the proposition.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2"

                        <p>I appreciated your letter of June 2.<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> wrote <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> to tell him about an
                                upcoming visit to the Soviet Union of former Vice President Hubert
                                Humphrey. (Ibid.)</note> I will of course be interested in anything
                            of substance that might develop in connection with Humphrey's visit.
                            Your ideas for handling the visit strike me as just right.<note n="3"

                                <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> stated his ideas as
                                follows: “I shall try to meet him on arrival and perhaps arrange a
                                small luncheon party with his hosts. I imagine that the Soviets will
                                try to keep him out of our clutches and that it would not be
                                appropriate for me to insist that I accompany him in his talks,
                                since he is a private citizen. I shall try to get hold of him to get
                                some briefing before his departure. He will doubtless stop by the
                                State Department and it will be interesting to see how he plans to
                                handle the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> question. I hope he
                                will remain fairly well committed on Vietnam.” (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>Your point about seeing the top Foreign Ministry officials from time to

                            considered US proposals contained in draft preliminary accord and

                            242, had prepared new plan for peaceful political settlement of Middle

                            tentative impression, however, is that it represents very little
                            movement and consists largely of a recasting of December 30 Soviet

                            begins. Soviet document does not provide for direct negotiations between
                            parties at any stage, does not include specific affirmation of
                            establishment of state of peace and calls for complete withdrawal by
                            Israel to pre-June 5, 1967 lines with all its neighbors. In prepared
                            oral statement commenting on this document Tcherniakov noted among other
                            things that on the whole it reflects Soviet views and that, if agreement
                            is reached with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, Soviets will need
                            to obtain final consent from Arab side.</p>
                        <p>4. Following foregoing presentation, Tcherniakov said he was instructed
                            to propose that venue of US-Soviet talks be moved to Moscow. Secretary
                            said we would study Soviet document carefully. Re moving bilaterals to
                            Moscow, Secretary noted that we had earlier informed Dobrynin we might
                            be willing to hold some of talks there. We would consider this
                            suggestion and give Soviets our reply after we had completed study of
                            document Tcherniakov had delivered.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName>Burns</persName>’ report of his conversation with a Soviet
                            economist (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">Tab A is attached but not
                                printed. On June 13, Burns wrote a memorandum to President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> describing his luncheon
                                meeting with Anatoly Shapiro, a Russian economist at the Institute
                                of World Economics in Moscow. Burns reported Shapiro's fears about
                                the U.S. attitude toward Sino-Soviet differences as follows: “If
                                [Shapiro] is really right that the Russians are fearful that
                                sentiment in this country, including that of our government, is
                                favorable to the Chinese Communists, this would suggest that the
                                Russians are in a nervous state of mind and that they feel they need
                                friends. All this is highly speculative on my part, and I'm merely
                                passing on what I learned for what little it may be worth.”</note>
                            simply confirms what we have long known: that the Soviets are terribly
                            uneasy about their potentially explosive dispute with Red China, and are
                            pathologically suspicious of anything that smacks of Sino-American
                            collusion.</p>
                        <p>We know that the Soviets are in a nervous state of mind, but they
                            apparently feel they need security more than they need friends—one piece
                            of evidence being their brutal suppression of nascent liberalism in
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>

                                        doesn't represent much change in the official Soviet
                                        position of the past twenty years, but it may indicate that
                                        they think they can get the Arabs to agree to this. The
                                        December 30 Soviet document did refer to “appropriate

                                        but the current version is much more explicit.</item>

                                        specifically, they have eliminated the Arab obligation to
                                        control the fedayeen. They also dropped our effort to end

                                        December 30. But it still turns aside our effort to create a
                                        situation for border changes to be negotiated. It
                                        concentrates on working out the timetable for Israeli
                                        withdrawal. Because of their position on withdrawal, the
                                        Soviets have not made any attempt to address the question of

                        <p>Pat <persName corresp="#p_BP1">Buchanan</persName> has relayed a
                            suggestion that the US recognize Albania and promote West German contact
                            with Communist China, as a means of making the Soviets nervous over a
                            possible US/Chinese deal. He suggests that this might lead the Soviets
                            to offer us something in return for our agreement to continue to
                            cooperate in isolating China. (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d61fn2">Tab A,

                        <p>I basically agree with attempts to play off the Chinese Communists
                            against the Soviets in an effort to extract concessions from or
                            influence actions by the Soviets. Any effort of this kind, however, is

                                    is that the Albanians could well react to any US initiative with
                                    loud and public vituperation. When we took the small step two
                                    years ago of allowing Americans to travel to Albania, the
                                    Albanian Government reacted with shrill hostility and announced
                                    that they would not allow Americans in. Since then,
                                    Czechoslovakia and the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                        >Brezhnev</persName> doctrine may have made them somewhat
                                    less inclined to slam doors in the face of contacts, but Chinese
                                    pressure and their own desire to maintain the pose of
                                    anti-imperialist purity might serve to make them turn down any
                                    US initiative. The proposed initiative would risk a scolding
                                    from the Albanians, and would make our friends nervous, without
                                    creating the appearance of a Sino-US deal.</item>

                                practical advantages in maintaining pattern of Soviets talking to us
                                in Washington, and therefore do not favor change of venue.</item>

                                would hope we might also get better feel of Soviet intentions and
                                strategy, although we realize difficulties this poses. (b) To engage
                                Soviets in brief discussion of Middle East arms control problem.
                                While Soviet response is probably predictable, we believe that for

                                exchange with Soviet Government. (c) To present our counter

                                following lines: When U.S.-Soviet talks began in Washington, it was
                                agreed that there might be some talks in Moscow as well. Assistant

                        <p>It is our judgment that we should not break off these talks now. While
                            the Soviet response contains less than we had hoped, it does offer some
                            refinements to work with. We may want to give them a negative reaction
                            for effect, but on balance it seems worth trying another round.</p>
                        <p>If you share this judgment, the attached proposal contains two principal
                            issues for your decision: <list>

                                            Israel-UAR border</hi>. In our first document, we left
                                        this to be negotiated by the parties, with the proviso that
                                        the pre-war border was not excluded as a solution. The
                                        Secretary's proposal would have us go back to the Soviets
                                        with substantially the same position, but this time with a
                                        fallback position we could use as bait to get them to be
                                        more forthcoming on direct negotiations and the substance of
                                        a peaceful relationship between Israel and the UAR.</p>
                                    <p>The fallback position proposed is that Israel would agree on
                                        returning to the pre-war border “assuming agreement on the
                                        establishment of demilitarized zones and on practical
                                        arrangements for guaranteeing freedom of navigation through
                                        the Straits of Tiran.” This formulation is designed to leave
                                        room for an Israeli position at Sharm al-Shaikh short of
                                        permanent annexation.</p>

                                                far ahead of the Israelis. They say that they must
                                                have a position at Sharm al-Shaikh and overland

                                        buy. But I would not at this stage give him authority to
                                        commit us in any way to the fallback language. That puts us
                                        too far ahead of Israel and gives away our position without
                                        any return. I think the Russians—not we—should be setting

                                        us a more three-dimensional picture than we get from

                                            <item>We have agreed substantially to the Soviet concept
                                                of a <hi rend="italic">timetable</hi> for withdrawal
                                                to go into effect under UN supervision after final
                                                agreement on overall terms. The difference between
                                                us and the Soviets on this point has been that they
                                                have tried to use the “timetable” idea to avoid
                                                direct negotiations. We have now accepted this part
                                                of their plan, but only in the context of
                                                negotiations.</item>

                                                administration as a choice. Although this is to be
                                                decided by the parties, the Israelis are likely to
                                                object to anything specific we say about a
                                                solution.</item>

                                            <item>We have included a reference to clearing the <hi
                                                  rend="italic">Suez Canal</hi>, as withdrawal
                                                proceeds. The Israelis could object in that this
                                                conceivably could open the canal before the other
                                                parts of the agreement became absolutely final. But
                                                we feel that once Israeli troops pull away from the
                                                Canal, the UAR will be free to do what it wants
                                                anyway.</item>

                                            <item>We have slightly altered our position on <hi
                                                  rend="italic">demilitarized zones</hi>. Our
                                                original position was that all of Sinai would be a
                                                DMZ and all details would be worked out by the
                                                parties. We have now left an opening for Egyptian
                                                troops along the Canal itself—this would put them
                                                only a few miles closer to Israel—and have defined
                                                more clearly our concept of administration in the
                                                DMZ's—the return of Egyptian civil
                                                administration.</item>

                                            <item>On the <hi rend="italic">refugees</hi> we have
                                                changed our position from calling for an upper limit
                                                on the total number of repatriates to calling for an
                                                annual limit. In theory this leaves the way open for
                                                the eventual repatriation of all the refugees and so
                                                will be less pleasing to the Israelis and more
                                                pleasing to the Arabs, although it will satisfy
                                                neither. Our guess is that so few refugees will want
                                                to live in Israel that a limit is
                                                unnecessary.</item>

                        <p>Soviet Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            spoke at length to the semiannual session of the Supreme Soviet in
                            Moscow today. We have a <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> summary
                            but no verbatim text yet.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">A full text of

                        </p>
                        <p>From the summary, it appears that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>'s language was temperate and on the whole
                            positive as regards relations with the US. In terms of content, however,
                            I can detect no advance on such matters as the Middle East, Vietnam,
                            Europe and arms control.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> mentions Romania several
                            times in the context of its membership in the Warsaw Pact and the
                            socialist camp, along with the other bloc countries. In effect, he
                            reaffirms the “<persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine”
                            albeit in less provocative words than the original formulation last
                            year.</p>
                        <p>The pre-occupation with China is very prominent; his words are a mixture
                            of threats to “rebuff” provocations and expressions of interest in
                            better relations in the long term.</p>
                        <p>On <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, he carefully describes the
                            forthcoming talks as an exchange of views rather than negotiations; he
                            does not refer to an opening date. (There are indications that we may
                            get a response fairly soon and that it will be in terms of early or
                            mid-August.) He also notes what you have said about a well-prepared
                            summit but leaves it at that.</p>
                        <p>All told, in my judgment, this speech leaves Soviet policy where it has
                            been; but the temperate tone on relations with us and, especially, on
                            arms talks will probably be cited—as the Soviets undoubtedly intended it
                            to be—by Administration opponents as justifying “restraint” on our
                            part.</p>

                                which was announced on June 28, as follows: “The Soviets also
                                reacted—in a manner that made clear they understood the significance
                                of the visit. The planned attendance of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"

                                cover memorandum that read: “I recommend that you read every page of
                                the document … Quick reading confirms the extremely concerned state
                                of mind of the Soviets with respect to the Chicom threat. It also
                                confirms a strong suspicion on their part that we should, if we have
                                not already started to, exploit the differences between the Soviet
                                Union and Communist China. The report, together with others that we
                                have picked up, simply confirms that a concerted effort on our part
                                to at least threaten efforts at rapprochement with the Chicoms would
                                be of the greatest concern to the Soviets. It is interesting to note
                                that the Soviets have surmised that the best environment for their
                                problem with the Chicoms is a détente situation.” (National

                            achieve the isolation of Peking. This theme is of course not sounded in
                            the speech to the Supreme Soviet, but its implications run through the
                            entire review.</p>
                        <p>2. The secret document is explicit on the point that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has no hopes of improving relations
                            with the present Chinese leadership. Whereas <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> told the Supreme Soviet that Moscow stands ready
                            to negotiate the questions disputed between the two states, the document
                            states that “such proposals will most likely prove basically
                            unacceptable to the present leadership of the <gloss target="#t_CPR1"
                                >CPR</gloss>” but will be useful in their effects on the Chinese
                            people and foreign Communists. The real task is to deny Peking friends
                            and allies in the socialist camp, among the imperialists, and around the
                            Chinese periphery in Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. In this regard, primary attention is given to the US. The secret
                            document reflects the usual ambivalence about US policy: its imperialist
                            interventions must be rebuffed, but sober elements may yet prevail in
                            Washington. The new element is the fear that the US will find a way to
                            use the Sino-Soviet rivalry against Moscow. While US public statements
                            maintain an “apparently neutral line” on Sino-Soviet relations, after
                            the Ussuri clashes “the idea of the usefulness of pressure on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> from two flanks—<gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and China—is ever more clearly
                            discernible.” The document draws the conclusions that, to head this off,
                            it is necessary in current policy “to manifest restraint, moderation,
                            and flexibility in relations with the US, to refrain from complications
                            with her which are not dictated by our important national interests.”
                            This conclusion is worked out in a number of ways in <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s subsequent formal

                        <p>4. In comparison to earlier set speeches of this sort, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> balances professions of desire
                            for good relations with the US with relatively little stress on the dark
                            sides of American policy. His acknowledgment of “deep class differences”
                            is more than offset by approving references to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s statement on an era of

                            “well-prepared summit meeting,” the first such Soviet reference since
                            the Inauguration. Criticism of the US role in the Middle East and
                            Vietnam is mild; in the <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss>

                            about Vietnam are eliminated. In both these cases, the Soviet version of
                            linkage—that a change in US policy would contribute to the settlement of
                            other questions—is briefly and moderately put.</p>

                        <p>5. The secret document is silent on this subject. To the Supreme Soviet,
                            however, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> endorses
                            strategic arms limitations and says the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is preparing to negotiate this matter with the US. He
                            rejects Chinese charges that this amounts to engaging in deception and
                            gives several arguments which may be designed as much to win over
                            waverers in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as to affect
                            debate in the US. One is that military superiority is unattainable
                            because of the action-reaction phenomenon between the two military
                            machines, and a second is the burden of spiraling costs. A third, which
                            is much more novel in Soviet parlance, is that the requirements for
                            quick reaction are placing the decision to go to war beyond human
                            control and into the tubes and tapes of the computers.</p>
                        <p>6. The Foreign Minister's presentation on the <gloss target="#t_NPT1"
                                >NPT</gloss>, a comprehensive test ban, and the seabeds treaty
                            breaks no new ground. In the arms control discussion, however, he sweeps
                            off the boards a number of long-standing Soviet proposals having to do
                            with nuclear weapons, such as non-first use and liquidation of nuclear
                            armaments. All such matters, he says, can be settled only with the
                            participation of all nuclear powers—”and I mean all.” Since he knows
                            that the prospect of Chinese agreement is zero, this signifies the
                            practical abandonment of such schemes.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>7. The secret document makes two points about this region. First, the
                            danger of Sino-West German collusion is second only to that of
                            Sino-American cooperation against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. Second, the socialist camp will have to content
                            itself with temporary, partial solutions, to European problems,
                            “actually putting on ice” more acute problems which cannot be agitated
                            without upsetting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. These ideas are
                            expressed, in the Supreme Soviet speech, in a rather forth-coming
                            attitude toward West Germany and a vague proposal for four-power talks
                            on West Berlin, unaccompanied by the usual list of pre-conditions. With
                            respect to Bonn, the standard criticisms are condensed and put in
                            relatively <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0234"/>calm tones, and the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is encouraged to continue its
                            efforts to negotiate with Moscow on the renunciation of the use of
                            force. The proposal on West Berlin seems to invite Bonn and the Western
                            Allies to believe that, if the Federal Republic will refrain from
                            political activities in the city, access will be undisturbed and perhaps
                            even improved. The tone of these passages is consistent with the
                            implication in the secret document that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, for larger reasons of policy, intends no new Berlin
                            crises for the indefinite future. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>'s speech is in fact being read in this manner in
                            both Germanies; Bonn officials are anxious to investigate the
                            negotiating possibilities, while Pankow betrays anxiety by largely
                            ignoring these passages in its commentary on the speech. At any rate, it
                            appears that East Germany's more far-reaching ambitions to undermine the
                            present status of West Berlin have been decisively set aside.</p>

                        <p>8. In the light of his strictures before the Supreme Soviet about the
                            Chinese threat, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s claim
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s proposal for a
                            collective security system in Asia is not directed against any
                            particular country has a hollow ring. The anti-Chinese thrust of the
                            secret document belies this assertion altogether, although it nowhere
                            mentions the proposal. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            adds no further details, even about the countries whose participation is
                            envisaged; at one point he speaks of “all Asian states” and at another
                            of “all interested states.” It seems clear that Moscow has no
                            expectation whatsoever of Chinese participation. It probably believes
                            that, while the obstacles to formal action cannot be overcome, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has much to gain, particularly
                            in the post-Vietnam environment, simply from launching a concept which
                            permits it to pose as the champion of collective security against
                            unnamed threats. The scheme is probably also designed to preempt any US
                            proposals for new collective organizations in the wake of a settlement
                            in Vietnam.</p>

                            role of China in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s troubles in
                            Eastern Europe. The public speech briefly refers to this and omits the
                            conventional charges that the US and West Germany are fomenting
                            counter-revolution in this area. The absence of even indirect attacks
                            upon Romania reflects a Soviet decision to swallow the displeasure which
                            Moscow finds in the US President's forthcoming visit to Bucharest.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeats the essence
                            of the “<persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> doctrine,” but
                            in a way which smacks more of defensive justification than any intent to
                            apply it anew. He is somewhat more explicit than previous spokesmen in
                            delimiting the sphere in which the doctrine is applicable, stating that
                            the Warsaw Pact “will <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0235"/>never
                            permit anyone to encroach on the security of its signatories and on the
                            socialist gains in these countries.” This formulation seemingly excludes
                            Yugoslavia, a point which the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has
                            never before clarified to Belgrade's satisfaction. A brief and amiable
                            passage acknowledges the socialist character of Yugoslavia but, lest
                            Belgrade's behavior be sanctioned as an example to other Eastern
                            Europeans, notes that Soviet relations with that country “are not always

                            and—unlike last year—he does not threaten Israel with the consequences
                            of failure to fulfill the Security Council resolution of November, 1967.
                            Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> notes that
                            Israeli withdrawal must be accompanied by Arab recognition of Israel's
                            right to exist, thus publicly recording a recent change in the Soviet
                            position. Less authoritative spokesmen often continue to support
                            withdrawal as a unilateral first step toward a settlement.</p>

                        <p>11. It would be easy to overstress the degree to which the struggle with
                            China is affecting various aspects of Soviet policy. While this impact
                            is evident in current Soviet documents and behavior, there is no sign of
                            a consequent willingness to give up important Soviet interests. Indeed,
                            many aspects of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s rivalry with
                            the US are embedded in third areas—Vietnam, the Middle East, Central
                            Europe—where the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not free to
                            call the shots and cannot propose major compromises without risking the
                            loss of influence. Within these limits, however, it seems clear that the
                            China problem has now reached a degree of intensity which is moving
                            Soviet policy onto an altered course. This course is intended to avoid
                            unnecessary conflict with others and to make sure that states which
                            cannot be corralled into an anti-Chinese front at least do not work
                            parallel to or in collusion with Peking against the Soviet Union.</p>

                                statement that if we could make progress or resolve the Middle

                                warm, he was relaxed, he smiled, he joked, and at no time made even
                                a faintly threatening sound. At same time he was serious and chose
                                his words carefully. He inquired several times regarding our
                                specific reaction to the Soviet proposal of June 17,<note n="2"

                                and whether I had brought with me a counterproposal. He underscored
                                that <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is ready to try “to

                                concluding statement noted above, he struck three themes: (A) <gloss

                                and U.S. and Soviets together have opportunity bring peace to Middle
                                East; (B) Generalities are fine as far as they go, but we need get
                                down to specifics, <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0237"/>leaving
                                as little unfinished business as possible for parties to deal with;

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> made point of
                                appearing flexible, several times correcting interpreter to soften
                                formulation of a particular point. In addition, during discussion of
                                Suez Canal and refugee aspect of settlement, while maintaining basic
                                Soviet position, he hinted that differences could be resolved. On
                                two fundamental issues which I stressed, however, namely need for
                                Arab commitment to direct negotiations at some stage and to specific
                                Arab obligations flowing from establishment of state of peace, he
                                revealed no discernible give, but seemed more than anything else to
                                be seeking to avoid coming to grips with issues themselves.</item>

                                    the Middle East greatly affects the world situation as a whole.
                                    It would be a short-sighted policy to repose hopes, as they do
                                    in Israel, in military superiority. The surest way would be to
                                    solve the problem on the basis of withdrawal of Israeli troops
                                    from occupied areas and simultaneous recognition of the right of
                                    all Middle Eastern states, including Israel, to independent
                                    national existence, and the establishment of a lasting peace in
                                    this important area. The Soviet Union considers that all

                                agreed that acquisition of territory by war was an anachronism and
                                unrealistic in today's world, it was also unrealistic for UAR not to
                                face up to need for coexistence with Israel. Israel is in occupation
                                with Arab territory as result of military success involving what to
                                Israelis was major national sacrifice. Israel would not give away,
                                or permit others to give away, its victory for nothing. We disagreed
                                with those in Israel who sought territory as price of victory; our
                                aim was to convince Israel to settle for peace and security. If
                                Israel was to be convinced, however, peace and security must be

                        <p>That estimate concluded that, short of major changes in the Soviet system
                            at home, the outlook is for chronic tensions in Soviet-American
                            relations. It also concluded that Soviet policy toward the US would
                            probably be characterized by cautious opportunism and limited pressures,
                            perhaps with some increased watchfulness against the development of
                            uncontrolled risks. We retain our belief in the validity of both of
                            these basic judgments. At the same time, we note the development of
                            increased Soviet alarm over the future course of relations with
                            Communist China. This alarm is likely at least for a time to have an
                            important impact on Soviet foreign policy overall; specifically, it
                            tends to encourage a somewhat more forthcoming Soviet attitude toward
                            relations with the US and toward particular issues affecting the

                                with the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. It was nourished by US

                                and sustained through the 1920's and 1930's by the continuing
                                struggle against “class enemies” at home and abroad. It diminished
                                during World War II, but then reached a high point of sorts in the

                                Under Khrushchev, the notion of capitalist encirclement was
                                discarded. Limited contacts with the outside world, including the
                                US, were permitted, and the line toward the West began to fluctuate
                                in intensity and assume a notably ambivalent tone. The US was still
                                evil, but “sober” elements in it were capable, in effect, of good;
                                the US remained the hostile leader of the imperialists, but it was

                                could get together. And policies toward the US began to reflect the
                                same kind of confusing mixture, ranging in mood and content from the

                                predetermined. Marxist-Leninist dogma affects the way in which these
                                men analyze the problems that confront them and, in general,
                                influences their manner of regarding themselves, their society, and
                                the world at large. It reinforces their feelings of distrust and
                                hostility toward the US and severely limits their ability to
                                approach mutual problems in a flexible mood. Moreover, the Soviet
                                leaders now believe themselves for a variety of reasons to be on the
                                ideological defensive; this has generated a mood of “fearful
                                conservatism” which is likely to affect the tone of Soviet-American
                                relations adversely for some time to come.</item>

                                    >USSR</gloss> tends to behave more as a world power than as the
                                center of the world revolution. Thus the Soviets are inclined to
                                establish international priorities in accordance with a more
                                traditional view of Russian security interests and a more realistic
                                view of the possibilities for expanding their influence. The <gloss

                                with measurements of power and risk. These opportunity/risk

                                    find it wanting. Sejna was for a time a valuable source of
                                    information on the Czechoslovak armed forces and the Warsaw
                                    Pact, but his remarks about the Pueblo seizure—especially those
                                    which have appeared recently in the public press—are in our view
                                    highly suspect. His account, for example, of a purported meeting
                                    in Prague in May 1967 with Soviet Defense Minister
                                    Grechko—during which Grechko is said to have discussed Soviet
                                    plans for the seizure of an American intelligence collection
                                    vessel—is almost certainly inaccurate. During extended
                                    questioning, he had given no hint that any such crucial meeting
                                    with Grechko had taken place. In any case, the best available
                                    evidence is that Grechko did not visit Prague at all during
                                    April, May, or June 1967. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
                                Such behavior would be contrary to general Soviet interests, as
                                described above. It would also seem, in view of the large scale
                                Soviet intelligence collection effort in international waters and
                                air space, contrary to particular Soviet interests as well. We have,
                                in any case, reviewed the evidence specifically concerning the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s attitudes and policies
                                toward these incidents and have concluded not only that Moscow was

                                plenum of the Central Committee, for example, does not indicate that

                                Pueblo. It clearly shows that the Soviet leaders were concerned
                                about the possibility of a forcible US reaction and had advised the

                                the US seemed slight. With the Arab-Israeli war of June 1967 and the
                                humiliating defeat of their clients, the Soviets appear to have
                                acquired a sharpened sense of the risks of their policy. Even now,

                                direct confrontation with the US than they are that their
                                considerable investment and influence will be jeopardized either by

                            <item>The Soviet attitude toward the new administration in the US
                                remains generally circumspect. Provocative acts and statements have
                                for the most part been avoided. There have been standard
                                denunciations of US policies and continuing attacks on “warmongers”
                                in the US establishment, but the President has been praised as well
                                as criticized (though not harshly by name), and it has been said
                                that there are reasonable men in the US who seek peace. Propaganda
                                has on the whole suggested a wait-and-see attitude, perhaps even a
                                mildly optimistic assessment of prospects for an improvement in the
                                relationship.</item>

                            <item>Indeed, despite their many reasons for sober concern about their
                                position vis-à-vis the US, the Soviets seem now to regard this
                                relationship in a cautiously optimistic light. Their relative
                                military strength, especially in strategic weapons, has greatly
                                improved over the past six or seven years. Their influence in
                                certain important countries of the Third World has grown, and fear
                                of Soviet aggressiveness has been declining, even—despite the
                                invasion of Czechoslovakia—in Western Europe. During the same
                                period, the Soviets have seen domestic stability in the US tested by
                                disorders and severe political discord, and have observed increasing
                                signs of public disenchantment with the scope of the US role in
                                international affairs.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has also showed a
                                relatively restrained approach to Western Europe. We do not think
                                that the current campaign for European security signals Moscow's
                                intention to abandon previous positions. On the contrary, the
                                Soviets are at least as anxious as ever to gain recognition of the
                                status quo, i.e., the division of Germany and the existence of a
                                legitimate Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe. But they do not now seem
                                disposed to stress the more controversial aspects of their position,
                                nor do they appear ready to dramatize their views through
                                provocative acts, as for example, in Berlin. At the same time, they
                                no longer emphasize the notion that the US should stand clear of an
                                all-European settlement.</item>

                            <item>The strongest and most emotional language used by the Soviets is
                                now directed against China, not the US and the other Western powers.
                                This shift in the intensity of feeling about foreign adversaries
                                seems to have been reflected in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss>'s apparently increasing willingness <pb n="212"

                                    >USSR</gloss> strategic relationship is overriding. Moscow's
                                current preoccupation with China has probably had some bearing on
                                its attitude toward the desirability of talks on strategic arms
                                control. Indeed, problems with China may have encouraged the Soviets
                                to look upon arms control measures with growing interest, seeing in
                                them a means to reduce tensions with the US and to bring additional
                                pressures to bear on Peking.</item>

                            <item>In the field of strategic armaments, the Soviets now must ponder
                                the effects of an arms control agreement in view of their improved
                                position. None of the courses open to them can be wholly appealing.
                                An effort to surpass, or even to keep pace with the US in the
                                development and deployment of advanced weapons systems would require
                                continued high expenditures, perpetuate the resource squeeze on the
                                civilian economy, and perhaps divert funds from other military
                                programs. And in the process, Moscow could have no assurance that it
                                would be able to compete successfully with US technological prowess.
                                On the other hand, a Soviet decision <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to
                                try to keep pace with the US seems highly unlikely; such a course
                                would surrender many of the fruits of past investment and allow the
                                political perils of strategic inferiority—as the Soviets conceive of
                                them—to re-emerge. Yet a decision to seek serious arms control
                                measures would not be easily reached. The Soviet leaders are
                                ambitious, opportunistic, and suspicious men. They are unlikely to
                                conclude that a strategic arms agreement is acceptable unless they
                                are convinced that achieving and maintaining a superior position is
                                not feasible in the future, and that the national interest could be
                                served by a sort of strategic stabilization. On neither count does
                                it seem likely that all the leaders would reach full
                                agreement.</item>

                            <item>Nevertheless, it is still our belief that the Soviets have strong
                                reasons—perhaps stronger than ever before—to consider carefully the
                                whole problem of strategic arms control. In the interim since our
                                last estimates concerning this subject, we have seen nothing which
                                would alter this judgment.<note n="7" xml:id="d68fn7">See <gloss

                                so far this year tends to confirm it. The Soviets have not concealed
                                their suspicions of US motives. Nor have they hidden their
                                discontent with certain US attitudes and statements, in particular
                                US suggestions that there should be a linkage between arms control
                                and other, broader issues. But they have also sought to appear
                                patient about the timing of arms control talks and have tried to
                                convince the US that they have retained a sober—though not
                                eager—interest in the negotiation of an agreement.</item>

                            Germany “including Berlin.” In subsequent consultations the Three Powers
                            and the Federal Republic agreed on the text of talking points to be made
                            to the Soviets. Direct reference to access to Berlin was eliminated at
                            French insistence.</p>
                        <p>The initiative with the Soviets has not yet been taken. The French and
                            apparently now the British concur in it. We might be inclined to delay
                            an action which the Soviets could mistakenly think was connected with
                            other current US-Soviet conversations. The German Government has,
                            however, urged that we agree to move ahead.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, in his speech of July 10, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> stated that if the Three Powers are interested,
                            the Soviet Union is willing “to exchange views as to how complications
                            concerning West Berlin can be prevented now and in the future.” The
                            German Government considers that the proposed tripartite initiative is
                            more urgent than ever in the light of <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>'s remarks. If we temporize the Germans will
                            suspect that we are unwilling to act in their interest lest it
                            jeopardize US-Soviet bilateral relations. We wish to prevent this and to
                            do so before Chancellor Kiesinger visits you on August 7 and 8.<note

                            Berlin are concerned, I believe that we should study them unilaterally
                            and in consultation with the British, French and Germans before we
                            decide on a response. I do not rule out the possibility of agreeing to
                            quadripartite talks concerning Berlin, but I believe that we should
                            first be sure of the objectives which we would seek.</p>

                        <p>The conference which convened in Moscow on June 5 was not at all what
                            Khrushchev had in mind when he began pressing for it in 1963–64. He
                            clearly wanted to ostracize the Chinese and restore Soviet authority in
                            a disintegrating international organization. While most parties at that
                            time shared his ideological aversion to Peking's policies there was a
                            growing apprehension over the self-proclaimed Soviet right to
                            “excommunicate” any one. This remained the underlying issue in the
                            intervening years.</p>
                        <p>The project lay dormant, after Khrushchev's removal, until late 1966;
                            some of the Soviet difficulties, however, were eased by the Vietnam war
                            and the ostensible Soviet willingness to cooperate with China in Hanoi's
                                defense,<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">

                                sentence up to this point.</note> and secondly, by the excesses of
                            the Cultural Revolution in China which dismayed most of China's
                            communist allies, such as the Japanese party.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> began to press for a new
                            conference to reassess the world situation, disavowing any intention of
                            driving the Chinese out of the international communist ranks. It took a
                            full year, until February 1968, however, to organize even a
                            “consultative meeting,” which convened in Budapest.</p>
                        <p>The Cubans refused to attend, and at the meeting there was a major
                            confrontation with Romania. The Soviet high priest of ideological
                            orthodoxy, Mikhail Suslov, laid down a tough line, and launched a major
                            attack on China. The Romanians, led by Paul Niculescu-Mizil, countered
                            in defense of the Chinese, and when attacked by the Syrians walked
                            out.</p>
                        <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>Nevertheless, agreement was reached on a projected date of late 1968 and
                            a single agenda item, the struggle against imperialism.</p>
                        <p>A permanent preparatory commission began sitting in Budapest.
                            Subsequently, 88 parties were invited to participate in this work, but
                            only 44 attended, and Romania was among the absentees.</p>
                        <p>By the time of the second preparatory meeting in June 1968, the Czech
                            crisis was approaching a climax. There was strong opposition against
                            proceeding with a conference until the Czech affair had been resolved.
                            The Soviets accepted a postponement until November 1968 and had to
                            settle for another “preparatory” meeting to discuss the final date.</p>
                        <p>The Czech invasion and the Soviet justification of “limited
                                sovereignty”<note n="3" xml:id="d71fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> bracketed “limited
                                sovereignty,” a phrase used in the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                    >Brezhnev</persName> doctrine.</note> created a brand new issue.
                            At the November meeting, a number of parties insisted on a further
                            postponement because of the Soviet invasion and the draft document was
                            scrapped, to be replaced by a new one drawn up by a small working group.
                            It was clear that a major issue was whether the Soviets could obtain an
                            endorsement of their rationale for intervention in Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>The last round of the preparatory meeting (May 23–June 5) witnessed a
                            frantic struggle. About 450 amendments were presented to the main
                            document, only about 45 were accepted. Romania sponsored about 100
                            amendments. By the time the meeting opened, the main document had been
                            greatly watered down.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>From the Soviet viewpoint the conference produced mixed results. It was
                            by no means an unqualified victory. On the other hand, it is doubtful
                            that the Soviet leaders regarded it as a defeat.</p>
                        <p>The fact that 75 communist parties did finally convene in Moscow after
                            six years of wrangling, and remained for thirteen debates, with no
                            walkouts, was a victory of sorts. To achieve this, however, meant
                            repeated retreats and compromises, until in the end it was clearly a

                        <p>In this sense it was a pyrrhic victory. The conference was in effect a
                            rump session, compared to 1957 and 1960. And on the question of the
                            legitimacy of Soviet authority as the pre-eminent party, nothing was
                            gained. While the Soviet leaders did not expect to restore the role of
                            “leading party,” abandoned by Khrushchev, in their heart of hearts this
                            is what they believe. They sought to demonstrate this by convening a
                            conference that no one really wanted. An objective observer would have
                            to conclude that the 1969 conference marked a further stage in the
                            decline of Soviet authority over its communist colleagues abroad.</p>

                        <p>Even in their most optimistic moments the Soviet leaders could not have

                        <p>The Romanian leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, had apparently been given the

                            speech on the preceding day and had threatened to walk out and return to
                            Bucharest, where he would summon the Central Committee to support his
                            action. There was a tense confrontation, but the Soviets outmaneuvered
                            him by claiming he would look foolish if he returned home and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> did not give the speech as
                            intended. So Ceausescu decided to wait and present a rebuttal. In fact,
                            the China problem was first raised by Paraguay, and then elaborated on
                            by Gomulka, before <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s
                            major speech. Ceausescu made an appeal against further criticism, but
                            about 55 parties spoke against China, thus giving the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> fairly strong support.</p>
                        <p>On this issue, then, the Soviet leaders have reason for some
                            satisfaction. They did not get approval of an edict of excommunication,
                            but <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0254"/>did not try to. They did
                            receive a significant degree of support, even though the limitation on
                            their power to impose their position was clearly demonstrated.</p>

                        <p>It is possible that had the Soviets remained silent on China, they might
                            have escaped without a direct airing of the Czech invasion. Once the
                            China question was broached, the dissidents were free to discuss the
                            Czech invasion. Several delegations attacked the Soviets directly, but
                            most remained silent and very few spoke in support. Husak had appealed
                            to the conference before it opened to avoid the issue, but this was
                            disregarded after the attack on China by Brezhnev.</p>
                        <p>On this issue, the final document is highly equivocal. Without mentioning
                            Czechoslovakia, it discusses the limited sovereignty, or <persName

                        <p>It seems increasingly obvious that once the conference had been convened
                            the Soviet leaders felt free to chart their own policy course without
                            much regard to the actual proceedings or the final agreed documents.
                            Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s speech is the
                            real Soviet position, and not the agreed statement on anti-imperialist
                            struggle. In this regard, the Soviet position is more conservative and
                            restrained. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was much

                            suggests that what was agreed to in Moscow will have no great influence
                            on Soviet policy, at least in the sense of forcing it into more
                            “revolutionary” lines. Both <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"

                                >Gromyko</persName> went well beyond the conference consensus in

                            elements in the West. Thus, one could conclude that all Moscow really
                            wanted was a dramatic forum to attack the Chinese leaders, and once

                            <item>Sino-Soviet relations, which have been tense and hostile for many
                                years, have deteriorated even further since the armed clashes on the
                                Ussuri River last March. There is little or no prospect for
                                improvement in the relationship, and partly for this reason, no
                                likelihood that the fragments of the world Communist movement will
                                be pieced together.</item>

                            <item>For the first time, it is reasonable to ask whether a major
                                Sino-Soviet war could break out in the near future. The potential
                                for such a war clearly exists. Moreover, the Soviets have reasons,
                                chiefly the emerging Chinese nuclear threat to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, to argue that the most
                                propitious time for an attack is soon, rather than several years
                                hence. At the same time, the attendant military and political
                                uncertainties might also weigh heavily upon the collective
                                leadership in Moscow.</item>
                            <label>C.</label>
                            <item>We do not look for a deliberate Chinese attack on the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Nor do we believe the Soviets
                                would wish to become involved in a prolonged, large-scale conflict.
                                While we cannot say it is likely, we see some chance that Moscow
                                might think it could launch a strike against China's nuclear and
                                missile facilities without getting involved in such a conflict. In
                                any case, a climate of high tension, marked by periodic clashes
                                along the border, is likely to obtain. The scale of fighting may <pb

                                than heretofore, and might even involve punitive cross-border raids
                                by the Soviets. Under such circumstances, escalation is an ever
                                present possibility.</item>

                            <item>In the light of the dispute, each side appears to be reassessing
                                its foreign policy. The Soviets seem intent on attracting new
                                allies, or at least benevolent neutrals, in order to “contain” the
                                Chinese. To that end Moscow has signified some desire to improve the
                                atmosphere of its relations with the West. The Chinese, who now
                                appear to regard the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as their
                                most immediate enemy, will face stiff competition from the Soviets

                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Korea and a briefing by <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> on China.]</p>
                        <p>The President: We have always assumed that the Chinese are hard liners
                            and the Soviets are more reasonable. But I think this is open to
                            question. Look at what actually happened. Can we sustain this
                            judgement?</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: No. The facts
                            don't support it.</p>
                        <p>The President: Ceaucescu<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">Nicolae Ceausescu was
                                the President of Romania.</note> says that the Soviets are tougher
                            and more aggressive than the Chinese. We must look at China on a long
                            term basis. This must be very closely held. We must look at it in a
                            bilateral context. China can't stay permanently isolated. To me, China
                                <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0259"/>uses the dispute with
                            Russia for internal use. But to me the Soviets are more aggressive.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: Border incidents
                            don't prove anything, but the Soviets have moved from 15 up to 30
                            divisions to China's border. They now have 3 new missile sites with a
                            range of 500 miles along the border. The Soviets fear they will soon
                            lose their first strike capability vis-à-vis China.</p>
                        <p>The President: We must recall the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> doctrine and the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
                            The Soviets continue to move forward and act aggressively when progress
                            is threatened. They are a tough group. We should relook at our own
                            estimates. They may have a “knock them off now” policy developing with
                            respect to China.</p>
                        <p>Now, in terms of our role, I am not sure if it is in our long term
                            interest to let the Soviets knock them off. We must think through
                            whether it is a safer world with China down, or should we look to
                            keeping China strong? These are rhetorical questions. The Asians fear
                            the Soviets first, and don't want a collective security arrangement.
                            They question this. They don't want the Soviets as their protector. We
                            must look at China after Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: I think the
                            Soviets are doing well. They are very active in Europe and also in the
                            Middle East. They talk softer but act much tougher. The Chinese have
                            been stalling.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>: No one at State
                            would favor a Soviet takeover of China. They also feel that the Chinese
                            threat is greatly overemphasized. This may suggest an aggressive Soviet
                            attitude but I am not certain.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary Green: China is still feared by the Asians. It is
                            their principal fear. They want us to remain but they might accept the
                            Soviets as an alternative.</p>
                        <p>The President: I don't want to overdraw this, but these countries don't
                            want the Soviets in.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary Green: The Soviets are certainly probably tempted to
                            surgically remove the Chinese nuclear threat.</p>
                        <p>(The meeting ended at 12:10 P.M.)</p>

                                    could to discourage this, but—especially with <persName

                                        <item>—It is useful to them with the Arabs to keep the talks

                                        <item>—They are trying to convince us that talks in Moscow
                                            can be more useful than talks in Washington.</item>

                                <item>We seem to have agreed—or nearly agreed—language on several
                                    points: <list>
                                        <item>—They accept the general principles in the preamble,
                                            but they want a settlement between Israel and all the
                                            Arabs, not just the UAR. They also shy away from our
                                            language where it implies direct negotiations.</item>
                                        <item>—They accept our definition of the kind of guarantees
                                            and conditions which will accompany a settlement except
                                            that they feel there is no need to include a reference
                                            to non-interference in the internal affairs of other
                                            countries. (This is not really an Arab-Israeli issue.
                                            Interference in the area is mainly in the domestic
                                            affairs of our Arab friends by the Soviets' Arab
                                            friends.)</item>

                                        <item>—In some instance, they agree with what we say but
                                            disagree with the emphasis. For example, they have no
                                            objection to our references to a cessation of
                                            belligerency but they feel we have unnecessarily
                                            emphasized the point. On the other hand, they feel we
                                            should be explicit about the Arabs having no obligations
                                            in a settlement if the Israelis don't fulfill their
                                            obligations. (These differences are only cosmetic as far
                                            as we and the Russians are concerned, but they are
                                            important for both of us in trying to bring along our
                                            clients.)</item>

                                <item>Despite all this, there are important differences remaining: <list>
                                        <item>—They are still pressing for their specific plan for
                                            implementing withdrawal rather than our vaguer
                                            formulation. (The real problem here is that their plan
                                            would eliminate the direct negotiations the Israelis
                                            feel are essential.)</item>
                                        <item>—They still don't like our position on borders. (Our
                                            fallback position—return to the old UAR-Israel
                                            border—would meet their needs, but presenting this
                                            depends on their being more forthcoming on Arab
                                            post-settlement obligations.)</item>
                                        <item>—The Egyptians are concerned—unduly in our view—about
                                            the Suez Canal. The Soviets say <persName
                                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> thinks we are
                                            plotting to take it away from him, but he may want our
                                            language changed so that he will have some legal basis
                                            for closing the canal if the Israelis don't
                                            behave.</item>
                                        <item>—The Soviets don't appear able to modify their
                                            position that DMZ's must be in Israel as well as the
                                            UAR. I suspect that this is because the Arabs are taking
                                            as stiff a line with Moscow for this position as the
                                            Israelis are with us against it.</item>
                                        <item>—They still want Gaza returned to the UAR, although
                                            Semyenov said he was talking about Arab administration,
                                            not sovereignty.</item>

                        <p>The two options being examined for the contingency of major Sino-Soviet
                            hostilities should be subjected to much more rigorous examination and
                            debate. As things now stand, the first approach—strict
                            impartiality—seems likely to break down completely in the execution, and
                            the second,—shading toward China—could have major consequences in our
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>This exists only in theory. In practice, the US will have to make choices
                            which will have the net effect of a distinct sympathy for one or the
                            other side.</p>
                        <p>Consider the following problems: <list>
                                <item>—do we continue bilateral and four-power Middle East talks
                                    with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>? if strict
                                    impartiality means business as usual, we should continue them;
                                    but this will be subject to the interpretation that we are
                                    condoning Soviet “aggression”;</item>
                                <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0263"/>

                                        >SALT</gloss>? if we did the Soviets and most of informed
                                    opinion in the world (and in China) would see it as favorable to
                                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; if we refused to talk
                                    this would be a clear retaliation, not impartiality;</item>

                                    treaty?</item>
                                <item>—consider a UN resolution condemning the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (introduced by Albania);
                                    could we abstain? Moscow would be overjoyed; could we vote
                                    against the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and be
                                    impartial, etc.?</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The point is, that in an effort to be truly impartial, we would probably
                            wind up clearly supporting the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                            unless we were prepared to take specific actions to indicate our
                            disapproval, which would then amount to support to China. Indeed, trying
                            to be even-handed and impartial or neutral once China has been attacked
                            by major force is clearly tantamount to supporting the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Even if all of the specific problems could be miraculously sorted out,
                            the world at large and domestic opinion is going to scrutinize our
                            position and conclude that we favor one side.</p>
                        <p>One way out of this dilemma could be not to adopt an avowed policy of
                            impartiality but one of enlightened self-interest, regulating our
                            reactions, statements, and actions to the actual situation. As many have
                            pointed out a Sino-Soviet war, for a limited period and if limited in
                            scope, is by no means a disaster for the US. It might just be the way to
                            an early Vietnam settlement. It might also be a “solution” to the China
                            nuclear problem.</p>
                        <p>In any case, it is worth considering the option of being mildly
                            pro-Soviet, trying at the same time to be mildly pro-Chinese, depending
                            on the scope and duration of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>In other words, instead of measuring our various actions against the
                            criteria of impartiality or neutrality, to measure each against the
                            national objectives of the United States, which are in the process of

                        </p>
                        <p>This variant does not seem to be very well thought through. Two reasons
                            have been advanced: <list>
                                <item>—we will incline toward China to extract some Soviet
                                    concessions;</item>
                                <item>—we will incline toward China to prevent a shift in the Asian
                                    “balance” (the argument apparently being that a major defeat of
                                    China would result in Soviet predominance).</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0264"/>
                        <p>The notion of extracting Soviet concessions, once major hostilities have
                            began, is extremely naive.<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">This is not to say
                                that the Soviets would not pay some price in advance to prevent a
                                more accommodating US policy toward China. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> The Soviets are not going to attack China in some
                            quixotic mood. If they take this drastic step, they will be fully and
                            totally committed to pursue it to the end. They are already working up
                            deep racial and political emotions in Russia. The Soviet leaders believe
                            we should share their concern about China, and expect, at the least,
                            sympathy and understanding of whatever actions they might take. They
                            will almost certainly regard American gestures to China as sheer
                            hypocrisy.</p>
                        <p>If this argument is even close to the mark, then the Soviet reaction to
                            our slight partially toward China is likely to be massively hostile.
                            They might not be able or want to do anything about it at the time, but
                            it will poison Soviet-American relations for a very long time.</p>
                        <p>The notion of supporting China to some small degree because of the effect
                            on the Asian balance is rather fatuous. Only a slight knowledge of
                            history suggests that foreign conquest of China is not very likely (the
                            Soviets are not so inexperienced as to believe they can conquer China).
                            A quick “victory” simply is not in the cards. The alternative of a long,
                            inconclusive struggle is another problem, but it need not be decided in
                            any contingency plan at this moment.</p>
                        <p>If the Soviet blow brings down the present regime, this would not be a
                            great disaster. A replacement would have to be anti-Soviet to come to
                            power. The alternative of a pro-Soviet faction surfacing in Peking after
                            an attack is too remote to be discussed; even if the Soviets could find
                            such Chinese leaders, their tenure in China would be brief, and their
                            authority would not extend beyond a few provinces.</p>
                        <p>The idea that we can build up political credit with the Chinese leaders
                            by displaying our sympathies is not very convincing. If we were serious
                            in this regard we should take actions to forestall a Soviet strike,
                            which the Chinese could claim we have full knowledge of (cf. press
                            reports of such a strike in all US papers on August 28).<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d76fn4">See, for example, Chalmers M. Roberts, “Russia

                        <p>If the strike does occur, the only way to gain a real credit in Peking
                            would be a straightforward anti-Soviet campaign. Anything short of this
                            will probably be regarded by the Chinese as a charade. Indeed, the
                            Chinese could already conclude that we know of Soviet intentions and are
                            colluding with them. If and when it becomes public knowledge that the
                            Soviets did in fact mention to us a strike against Chinese nuclear
                            facilities, the Chinese will simply write us off as Moscow's tacit
                            ally.</p>

                        <p>In sum, there is a considerable danger that by trying to be slightly
                            sympathetic towards Peking we will court a massive over-reaction from
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and still accomplish very
                            little in the eyes of this or any other Chinese leadership.</p>

                        <p>On September 11, 1969, from 10:17 a.m. to 12:24 p.m., the National

                                    Vietnamese. Another possibility would be some sort of
                                    understanding about the limits of Soviet imperialistic ambitions

                            there are enough disadvantages in this situation and advantages in a
                            settlement to give us some leverage. With a settlement, they could
                            pursue their interests without risk of war, get their fleet into the
                            Indian Ocean and still have enough tension points like the Persian Gulf
                            to exploit. The balance is fine enough however that they might cooperate
                            with us in pressing a reasonable proposal on the Arabs. They apparently
                            judge that pressing our present proposals would cost them too much in
                            Cairo. Given this delicate a balance and our inability to press the
                            Israelis beyond certain limits, it may be that on this issue we are
                            negotiating in a relatively narrow field.” (National Archives, <persName

                            decision to strike militarily against China, it can be anticipated that
                            Moscow will persist in efforts to strengthen its military position along
                            the border with China, to develop improved relations with both Communist
                            and non-Communist countries on the Chinese periphery, to shore up its
                            overall security position (particularly in Eastern Europe), to diminish
                            Chinese influence in other Communist countries, to protect its political
                            gains in the Middle East, and to establish a generally less hostile
                            relationship with the West.</p>
                        <p>“The character of Soviet policy could change if Moscow comes to believe
                            that the Chinese are on the way to breaking out of their largely
                            self-inflicted isolation, and most especially if this seemed to be
                            happening in a way that foreshadowed a real and far-reaching Chinese
                            rapprochement with the U.S. In this event, the Soviets might well see a
                            need to strengthen further their general military position; they might
                            feel greater compulsion to strike militarily at China; and they might
                            adopt a more hostile attitude toward the U.S. Alternatively, the Soviets
                            might decide that a serious effect to improve relations with the U.S.,
                            even at the expense of concessions on specific issues, was more likely
                            to serve their interests.</p>
                        <p>“It seems probable that the Chinese, for their part, also now regard the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as their most immediate and
                            threatening adversary. They seem determined to give no ground in the
                            quarrel, in spite of their obvious military weakness vis-à-vis the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Since many of the handicaps
                            which encumber Chinese foreign policy are of their own making, the way
                            to greater international maneuverability is open to them—if they choose
                            to use it. It is possible, therefore, that Peking might at some point
                            come to see that it would be better served in the struggle with the
                            Soviets by a more flexible posture. This could, even in the near term,
                            lead the Chinese to seek improved relations with third countries and a
                            somewhat less hostile relationship with the U.S. Peking recognizes its
                            own military weakness in facing the Soviet Union and it is most unlikely
                            that the Chinese will launch a military attack against the <gloss

                            expected to react violently against any Soviet attack on Chinese
                            territory.</p>

                            whereas our problems with China lie mainly in Asia. For the foreseeable
                            future, the views of Peking and Moscow as to how the world should be
                            organized are likely to remain incompatible with ours. Thus, until a
                            fundamental and far-reaching change takes place in China or in the

                            differences we have with either is unlikely. Nevertheless, there is

                            Broadly, however, each of the three powers wants to avoid collusion
                            between the other two or any dramatic expansion of the power of either

                            could make it clear that it would not welcome a major Sino-Soviet
                            conflict and believed dangerous international complications would ensue.
                            Even if such a position did not reinforce councils of caution in Moscow
                            and Peking, it should serve U.S. purposes in relations with third
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>“In making contingency preparations if major Sino-Soviet hostilities
                            seemed imminent, care should be taken to avoid creating the impression
                            that we were preparing to take military advantage of either Peking or
                            Moscow since this could contribute to the explosiveness of the
                            situation.” (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>Following a private talk with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> stated that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had expressed the wish to be
                            able to talk to us in confidence on this subject. The Secretary had
                            assured Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that what he
                            had to say would be kept confidential within the limitations of our free
                            press. The Secretary then introduced Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Gerard Smith</persName> as the Director of the U.S. Arms Control
                            and Disarmament Agency and pointed out Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName>'s particular interest in this subject.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                            he recognized the importance of this problem; it was under thorough
                            study in the Soviet Union and, he assumed, in the United States as well.
                            The Soviet Union would soon reply to the last U.S. proposals concerning
                            the time and place for preliminary discussions and would also inform us
                            of the composition of the Soviet delegation. The reply will, of course,
                            be positive, since the desirability of holding arms limitation talks
                            follows logically from the position of the Soviet Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary took this occasion to indicate to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that our review of the
                            situation in Helsinki had shown that it would be difficult for us to
                            hold the talks there. We would consider Vienna or Geneva to be more
                            suitable for the purpose; we were also receptive to the suggestion of
                            holding the talks in two places on an alternating basis, for example
                            three months in one place to be followed by a like period in another. We
                            did not, however, suggest that Washington and Moscow would be suitable
                            for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> recalled that
                            at the early stages the possibility of preliminary procedural talks in
                            Washington and Moscow has been mentioned.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in view of the delay which had occurred he did
                            not think it advisable for the preliminary discussions to be held in
                            Moscow or in Washington. As for a permanent site for the talks, we would
                            be happy to consider Soviet suggestions; we were not inflexible and were
                            willing to talk about where the meetings should be held.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> repeated once again
                            that for the time being the problem was under study by the Soviet
                            Government and asked not to be prodded into replying to the United
                            States proposal, since such prodding, especially in public, would
                            neither speed nor slow the Soviet reply.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had not intended to prod the Soviet
                            Government into replying, but that we had indicated to the press that we
                            were willing to start the discussions; we were, however, quite relaxed
                            in our position.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that
                            some time ago the United States Government had proposed an exchange of
                            views with the Soviet Government on ways of improving the situation
                            relating to West Berlin. He also thought the present situation there was
                            not normal as a result of certain steps taken by the Government of the
                            Federal Republic of Germany. There was no need at this time to delve
                            deeply into the history of this problem, since this would merely prolong
                            discussion needlessly. In principle he agreed that it would be useful to
                            conduct an exchange of views on this problem between the Governments of
                            the United States and the Soviet Union, but wanted to inquire as to what
                            the U.S. Government had in mind with respect to the results of such an
                            exchange of views. Did the United States intend to have these results
                            reflected in a formal document, as was customary in international
                            practice, or did we merely want to improve the situation de facto on the
                            basis of mutual example; in other words, what did we conceive as
                            possible ways of reflecting the results of the future exchange of views.
                            He suggested that if the Secretary was not ready to reply at the present
                            moment, he might give the problem some thought and return to it at the
                            time of their next meeting on Friday. If this was acceptable, he did
                            want to take this opportunity to suggest Moscow as the place for holding
                            this exchange of opinions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he understood that East Germany and West Germany
                            had already entered into discussions on possible ways of improving
                            relations between them, especially with respect to transportation,
                            communications and similar matters. We would be glad if these
                            discussions resulted in better relations between East Germany and West
                            Germany. As for the question of Berlin, both East Berlin and West
                            Berlin, the Secretary believed this to be of concern to the Four Powers
                            and thought that any discussions for improving the situation there
                            should include all four.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> emphasized that his
                            remarks were intended to deal with the situation in West Berlin and not
                            with the situation in Germany in general. This did indeed touch upon the
                            interests of the other allies. Some time ago, however, the United States
                            had raised the question of conducting an exchange of views between the
                            Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States; today the
                            Secretary talked about Berlin in terms of the Four Powers. Did this mean
                            that we were withdrawing our suggestion for bilateral discussions? He
                            was simply asking this question in an attempt to understand the
                            Secretary's thinking on the subject and not in order to raise any
                            objections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he thought any discussions concerning the
                            future of Berlin would have to include the other two powers. He would be
                            happy to talk about how this could be brought about. In this connection,
                            however, he was not quite sure what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> had in <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0279"
                            />mind as to the objectives that might be achieved in talks. The Soviet
                            reply had not been entirely clear to us and we wondered what their ideas
                            were.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that this was
                            precisely the question he was addressing to the Secretary as
                            representative of the Government which had proposed these discussions.
                            It was he who was asking for clarification. What did the Secretary
                            consider to be the best way of reflecting the results of such an
                            exchange of views? He repeated his earlier suggestion that if the
                            Secretary needed time to consult on this problem, they could return to
                            it at their next meeting. If the Secretary's thinking was in terms of
                            Four Power talks, he did not object in principle and would consider it
                            useful to discuss ways of putting the machinery for such an exchange in
                            motion. He thought this was something both sides should have a chance to
                            consider and return to it later.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that this was a good suggestion and said he would be
                            willing to discuss it further next Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2"

                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">Hillenbrand</persName>
                            remarked that the specific form of any possible agreement, that is,
                            whether it should be a written document or a de facto improvement,
                            would, no doubt, depend upon the course of the discussions and could be
                            considered as we went along.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that whether the
                            talks were held on a bilateral or on a Four Power basis, inasmuch as
                            communications to and from West Berlin passed through the territory of
                            the German Democratic Republic, his Government would, of course, have to
                            be in consultation with the Government of the GDR. He was just
                            mentioning this “by the way,” as it were.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed to return to this question next Friday.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he and Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had already had some
                            preliminary discussions on the Middle East, in which the position of
                            each Government had been set forth, and now wanted to talk about what
                            could be done to move the matter forward a bit. He knew that we could
                            not resolve the matter tonight or for some time to come. He wanted to
                            suggest that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            and Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> get
                            together again starting tomorrow to examine the U.S. document submitted
                            in July,<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">See <ref target="#d67">Document
                                    67</ref>.</note> in order to identify areas of agreement and
                            areas of disagreement. He and the Foreign Minister could discuss it
                            further on Friday. When we came to points which we could not resolve,
                            the points of agreement and disagreement might be passed <pb n="247"
                                xml:id="pg_247" facs="0280"/>on to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Jarring</persName> to see if negotiations between the parties could
                            eliminate the areas of difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied he did not
                            mind; the Ambassador would be ready to start working tomorrow. The
                            Soviet Government was doing everything it could to facilitate a solution
                            of the Middle East problem. He thought that unfortunately Israel was not
                            doing anything to make a solution possible. He also thought the United
                            States was underestimating its possibilities with respect to its ability
                            to influence Israel.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that they had discussed the matter earlier. The
                            Foreign Minister had originally said he did not think we were doing
                            enough to influence Israel; now he had put it in a more friendly
                            manner—that we were underestimating our possibilities in that direction.
                            He did think it was urgent to move toward a solution of the Middle East
                            problem and it would be good if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                            UN General Assembly. These consisted of two main parts. The first
                            concerns a ban on chemical and biological weapons.<note n="4"

                            was not a matter of special interest to the Soviet Union alone, but he

                            to have the Secretary study the proposal and approach it objectively to

                            concerned the maintenance of peace and international security.<note

                                    <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, September 20, 1969,
                                p. 10.</note> Although the second proposal was worded in very
                            general language, it did contain some specific provisions. In a word, he
                            wanted to ask the Secretary to study it and he would be very glad if we
                            could find some common language. If our <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248"
                                facs="0281"/>two powers could do anything to lessen international
                            tensions, a great deal would have been accomplished. He thought this was
                            indeed possible.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the first proposal the Secretary inquired of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> if he did not think
                            that this was a matter for the Disarmament Committee in Geneva. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> said that would
                            normally be the case. The Secretary went on to say that we were in
                            accord with the objectives stated, but that he, too, was of the opinion
                            that this was a matter normally to be taken up in Geneva. As for the
                            second proposal, he would give it some attention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that he did not
                            know what was “normal” with respect to submitting such proposals. There
                            was nothing in the UN Charter to direct any particular approach. He
                            thought the “shortest” way was to lay the proposals directly before the
                            General Assembly. He would like to speed a resolution of this problem,
                            since the passage of time would make its solution more difficult. That
                            was the only consideration the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had
                            in putting the matter before the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said maybe he had used the wrong word. He felt the CBW
                            issue could be handled more quickly in Geneva. In the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> the proposals were likely to develop into
                            a propaganda exercise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that in fact the
                            proposal was already before the Geneva Committee. In any case, he
                            appreciated the Secretary's remarks.</p>

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> inquired
                            if the Secretary thought it would be possible to work out a maritime
                            agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union. His country
                            had such agreements with many other nations; in spite of the fact that
                            both our countries were maritime powers there was no specific maritime
                            agreement between us. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> amplified that what they had in mind was an
                            agreement providing for port facilities, entry of merchant vessels and
                            similar questions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            said that it would be desirable for our two countries to work out an
                            agreement regulating the question of receiving each other's merchant
                            ships. He was not talking about a trade agreement at this time.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he thought we would indeed be very interested
                            in this matter and promised to reply in detail on Friday. He thought
                            that anything we could do in the way of such agreements would be helpful
                            for both our countries.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary inquired as to the status of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
                            Treaty and asked if the Soviet Union was ready to proceed with
                            simultaneous ratification and deposit of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied
                            that his Government had <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0282"/>started
                            the process of ratification. The Foreign Affairs Commissions of the
                            Supreme Soviet had considered the Treaty and had recommended that the
                            Presidium of the Supreme Soviet take final action on it. The Treaty was
                            now before the Presidium for this final act in the ratification
                            process.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had completed all necessary steps short of
                            actual ratification. We felt it would be useful if U.S. and Soviet
                            ratification and deposit of the Treaty took place simultaneously.
                            Putting these final acts on international television would send the
                            Treaty off to a good start.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said his Government
                            would consider this possibility and take appropriate measures to move
                            ratification along. In this connection he wanted to inquire as to the
                            position of the Government of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            with respect to accession to the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>. He
                            had discussed this question with <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> had told him he
                            thought the new Government of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
                            to be formed after the German elections, would take action to sign and
                            ratify the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he believed that if the United States and the Soviet
                            Union ratified the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>, other
                            Governments, including that of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
                            would do so also. If, on the other hand, our two countries were to
                            continue to hold back, there was the danger that others would lose
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that in his talk
                            with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> the latter had
                            not referred to Soviet ratification as a condition for <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> accession to the Treaty. In any case,
                            he thought the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> must understand that
                            the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was not a matter to be played
                            with, and suggested that the Secretary and he remain in touch to speed
                            completion of ratification and deposit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed and remarked that it would be particularly desirable
                            if the Treaty were ratified by both countries before the Strategic Arms
                            Limitation Talks began, in order to spur progress in the direction of
                            control over nuclear weapons. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> said that this argument had some “reason.”</p>

                        <p>The initiative apparently came from the Soviets, perhaps using the

                            understanding, whether the Chinese agreed to the meeting or not. Should
                            hostilities ensue, the Soviets would thus be in a position to present
                            themselves as the aggrieved party. At the same time, the actual Soviet
                            motive may have been to put on the record for Chinese benefit their
                            refusal to tolerate a protracted border conflict. This is the line they
                            took in recent letters to other Communist parties. It may not
                            necessarily reflect a Soviet decision to escalate, but rather an effort
                            to pressure and deter the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese motive is a question, since so far they have been quite
                            consistent in rejecting third party intervention or direct Soviet
                            appeals. The Chinese willingness to receive <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> could reflect the more flexible Chinese
                            diplomacy which seems to have been developing in recent months. However,
                            the Chinese would not wish to appear to be resistant to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s visit, especially since third
                            parties in the Communist world were apparently involved, and would want
                            to appear at least as “reasonable” as the Soviets. In their public
                            treatment they took <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0284"/>pains to
                            minimize its significance by stating that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> was merely “on his way home” and that Chou

                                September, and none at all about its content or results.<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d82fn3">On September 12, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover
                                    sent information obtained from “an extremely sensitive source”
                                    about the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>–Chou

                                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, and Mitchell.
                                    According to the FBI source, “both <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                        >Kosygin</persName> and Chou feel it would not be in the
                                    best interest of either country to terminate the Vietnam
                                    conflict at this time. Both feel that the Vietnam conflict is
                                    keeping the United States tied up in that area and that it is
                                    bleeding the economy of the United States to support South
                                    Vietnam.” On September 17, a senior <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                        >CIA</gloss> analyst informed the Deputy Director of Current
                                    Intelligence of his “grave reservations about the accuracy and
                                    value of this [FBI] report.” Discrediting the origin of the FBI
                                    report and its substance, the analyst concluded that “we do not
                                    think that the Sino-Soviet relationship is of the kind that
                                    would have allowed either side to discuss future plans on
                                    Vietnam as this report alleges.” Apparently, the FBI information
                                    was discounted in the writing of the attached <gloss

                            <p>Clearly it was arranged on short notice. When <persName

                                for Moscow. He made a brief stop at Calcutta and got as far as
                                Dushanbe, in Soviet Central Asia, when his plane altered course and
                                headed for Irkutsk. There it was met by a flight from Moscow which,
                                after a brief stop, headed on for Peking.</p>
                            <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0285"/>
                            <p>The Soviets were the first to announce the meeting, saying the two
                                sides “openly set forth their positions and held a conversation
                                useful to both sides.” The Chinese statement, coming a few hours
                                later, was even more terse, saying simply that “frank talks were
                                held” and revealing that the meeting took place at the airport.</p>
                            <p>Since the meeting, on 11 September, our monitoring has picked up no
                                anti-Chinese polemics in the Soviet press and radio. The same is
                                true for the Chinese radio, but two anti-Soviet press articles
                                appeared on 11 September.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">
                                <hi rend="italic">Possible Explanations:</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>There are several possible explanations for the unexpected and
                                dramatic meeting. One is that the Chinese, well aware of the
                                continuing Soviet build-up along their borders and apprehensive over
                                the increasing speculation that Moscow intended to conduct a
                                preemptive strike against their advanced weapons facilities, asked
                                for the meeting in an effort to calm down their bellicose neighbor.
                                This scenario seems highly unlikely, however. First reports indicate
                                that Chinese propaganda against the Soviets is continuing even after
                                the meeting. Had the Chinese proposed the talks and shown signs of
                                apprehensiveness or fear, the Soviets would have demanded an end to
                                such propaganda as a precondition to any easing of tension.
                                Moreover, the Chinese communiqué on the meeting made it clear that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was treated with
                                minimum respect during his brief visit—he never even left the
                                airport. This is hardly the kind of treatment he would have received
                                if the Chinese had pressed for the meeting in order to arrange some
                                sort of accommodation with Moscow.</p>
                            <p>Another possibility is that the Soviets pressed for the meeting in
                                order to present the Chinese with some sort of ultimatum regarding
                                the border. Although Moscow has recently issued stern warnings to
                                Peking through their propaganda media, this explanation for the
                                meeting also seems unlikely. The Soviets would hardly have to send
                                their premier to the Chinese capital to deliver such an ultimatum.
                                Had this been their intention they could have effectively achieved
                                their purpose by calling in the Chinese chargé in Moscow and reading
                                the riot act to him. Furthermore, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                    >Kosygin</persName>'s abrupt reversal of his flight plans in
                                order to reach the Chinese capital seems a rather humiliating
                                prelude to the issuance of some sort of “final warning.”</p>
                            <p>Still another possibility is that the meeting was not directly
                                related to bilateral relations between the two countries but
                                concerned Vietnam. The Chinese may have informed the North
                                Vietnamese that they were cutting off all Soviet arms shipments to
                                Hanoi, for example, and the Vietnamese might have then urged
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to travel to
                                Peking to iron this problem out. Or Hanoi, pointing to Ho Chi Minh's
                                “will,” might have again urged the two parties to attempt to compose
                                their differences. <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0286"/>However,
                                the North Vietnamese have been urging the two sides to do exactly
                                this for years—with no effect. There is nothing in the present
                                situation which would suggest that such advice would now fall on
                                fertile soil. Moreover, when in the past the Chinese have created
                                difficulties over Soviet arms shipments it has been the North
                                Vietnamese themselves who have taken the initiative in straightening
                                things out—clear indication that Hanoi recognizes that it, rather
                                than Moscow, can apply leverage on Peking in this matter.</p>
                            <p>Yet another possibility is that a large-scale, but unannounced
                                incident recently occurred somewhere along the Sino-Soviet border—an
                                incident of such gravity that it required direct talks between the
                                two premiers. This scenario would help explain the suddenness of the
                                meeting in Peking, but it would not fit the pattern of previous
                                major incidents occurring in the past year. Both sides have
                                immediately publicized such incidents, and at this juncture neither
                                side would have much motivation to conceal a new clash. Furthermore,
                                a major clash would in all likelihood be reflected in some manner in
                                communications intelligence, and this has not occurred.</p>
                            <p>It seems most likely that the initiative in calling for the meeting
                                came from the Soviet Union. The Soviets probably believe: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>that the course of the Sino-Soviet dispute has reached a
                                        dangerous stage. It is hurting them on several fronts. The
                                        Chinese, they believe, are trying to “bleed them white”
                                        along the border. At the same time, the Soviets are being
                                        put at a disadvantage politically because their enemies and
                                        their allies as well believe them to be off-balance and on
                                        the defensive because of their preoccupation with the
                                        Chinese.</item>

                                    <item>
                                        <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> could have
                                        gone to Peking either to issue a last direct warning to the
                                        Chinese to cease and desist or face the consequences. We
                                        think it more likely that, though he may have talked in

                                        discover whether there was a way to bring the conflict down
                                        from its present risky level. The hiatus in propaganda,
                                        particularly if it should continue, would point in this

                            make clear to the Soviets that our major problem with them is their
                            support of Hanoi's stonewalling.</p>
                        <p>Basically, I think we need not be particularly concerned about Soviet
                            professions of “doubts” about us because of our defense program. Moscow
                            is well aware of the debates in this country. They realize that our
                            strategic program has stood still while theirs has progressed rapidly.
                            Comments like those by <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            are chiefly designed to provide arguments for our critics and to put us
                            on the defensive. The major obstacle to <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss> indeed may be not that we are building up our forces
                            but that we are not. Thus the Soviets may feel they have little to gain
                            from talks.</p>
                        <p>On specific subjects, the following points are worth noting: <list>

                                    other modalities. It is hard to say whether this caution <pb

                                    decision-making in Moscow or reflects a Soviet judgment that we

                                    The Soviets undoubtedly sense a good deal of Western interest in
                                    talking about Berlin, especially in the <gloss target="#t_SPD1"

                                    interested in a modus vivendi, there are no signs that they will
                                    be prepared to buck the GDR's continued interest in keeping the
                                    situation unsettled. Negotiations, whether bilateral US-Soviet
                                    or four power are therefore likely to encounter a rigid
                                    Soviet-GDR position, while we, especially if <persName

                                    is weak; the other side holds all the cards. We thus have no
                                    interest in pushing Berlin negotiations at this time, although
                                    we will undoubtedly come under pressure to do so and may in the

                                    we have repeatedly proposed. The Soviets will presumably decide
                                    on their course after the German election of September 28.
                                        (<persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> told

                                    State are thinking of a major ceremony with full TV coverage in
                                    the event the Soviets agree to joint ratification, and Bill
                                    apparently discussed this possibility with <pb n="256"

                                    overtones of “condominium” and we would do well to avoid
                                    excessive atmospherics.</item>

                        <p>We were asked to do a talking paper. As always, one can speculate
                            endlessly on why <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> wants
                            to see you; on the issues that amount to anything, you know better than

                            your thoughts, following are some guesses about what he wants to talk
                            about: <list>

                                    thence directly home. One further angle: you had better settle
                                    the text of any announcement or press comment so that we don't
                                    get into the ridiculous hassle that <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"

                            at his request. I let him wait for a week but agreed to a brief
                            appointment on Saturday afternoon.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> remarked that his Minister regretted not having
                            had an opportunity for a longer chat with me. Had <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> been able to visit Washington,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would have given a
                            luncheon for him and me at the Soviet Embassy. The absence of a visit to
                            Washington made <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s trip
                            somewhat unusual. I said I regretted that his Foreign Minister did not
                            come to Washington, as I would have enjoyed talking to him, and was
                            sorry his schedule was so crowded. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> replied that the difficulty was the absence of
                            a meeting with the President, which had been a standard procedure during
                            previous visits to the General Assembly. I told him that in order to
                            keep ourselves from being swamped we had adopted the rule that no
                            Foreign Minister would see the President in Washington. In any event,
                            there had never been a formal request. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he was not aware that there were such fine
                            questions of protocol.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then remarked that his
                            Minister had asked him to inquire whether in negotiating the Berlin
                            issue we had any preference as to forum. Specifically, did we care
                            whether it was discussed in a four-power or two-power forum? While the
                            Soviet Union was willing to speak in a four-power forum, it was also
                            prepared to have two-power discussions. I told him that four-power
                            discussions seemed to be quite acceptable. If there was any different
                            inclination on the part of the President, I would let him know.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the
                            Middle East and said that the meeting in New York had been very
                            constructive. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> hoped that
                            he would be able to come to a preliminary agreement with the Secretary
                            of State before his departure on Wednesday. He asked for intercession of
                            the White House in expediting this agreement. I replied that since
                            matters seemed to be in train on the diplomatic level, there was no need
                            for White House intervention. I added that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> should understand our elemental position. We
                            had made several communications to the Soviet Union on Vietnam to which
                            they had never replied. While this did not inhibit normal diplomatic
                            relations, it made it very difficult for the White House to go beyond
                            what normally occurred on the diplomatic level.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the President called.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">According
                                to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s October 1

                                    >Nixon</persName> had prearranged the telephone call.</note>
                            When the conversation was completed, I commented that the President had
                            called me at a providential <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0292"
                            />moment because it enabled me to tell the President directly what was
                            being discussed. To us Vietnam was the critical issue. We were quite
                            prepared to discuss other subjects, but the Soviet Union should not
                            expect any special treatment until Vietnam was solved. They should also
                            have no illusions about the seriousness with which we took Hanoi's
                            attempt to undermine the domestic position of the President. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me whether there was any
                            hope for a coalition government. I replied that we had covered the
                            subject at great length previously and that I could add nothing. It was
                            a pity that all our efforts to negotiate had failed. The President had
                            told me in his call that the train had just left the station and was now
                            headed down the track. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            responded that he hoped it was an airplane and not a train and would
                            leave some maneuvering room. I said the President chooses his words very
                            carefully and that I was sure he meant train.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked what our
                            problem had been in the past. I said that every negotiation turned into
                            a discussion on our readiness to accept the 10 points.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d85fn3">The delegation of the National Liberation Front of

                            said that my own conversations with the Vietnamese seemed to have gone
                            rather well. I asked him what he meant. He said Hanoi had told Moscow
                            that they had been very impressed by my presentation and thought I
                            understood Vietnamese conditions very well. I replied that if this were
                            true the next move was up to them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then engaged in a
                            lengthy exposition to the effect that the Soviet Union, for its own
                            reasons, was interested in peace in Vietnam and had in the past often
                            been helpful. I countered that we had no illusions about Soviet help in
                            the past. It had been considerably in the interest of Hanoi and had been
                            largely tactical. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that he wanted to assure me of Moscow's continued interest in improved
                            relations with the U.S., but it was getting very difficult to convince
                            Moscow of our goodwill. There had been no real progress on any subject.
                            For example, we could have been more generous on trade liberalization. I
                            said the most important issue was Vietnam. As soon as Vietnam was out of
                            the way and especially if the Russians took an understanding attitude,
                            we would go further. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            smiled and said that I had an unusual ability to link things together. I
                            told him that we had hoped to have a reply on <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            there would be a reply in due course but did not give any indication as
                            to when.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> returned to the subject
                            of Soviet interest in improving relations with us. I said we
                            reciprocated this feeling, especially after Vietnam was out of the
                            way.</p>

                            very fast on Soviet-American relations in general. D did not mention

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told the President he didn't think we

                            serious. He wanted us to be very forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> wanted to know D's attitude. <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said they want major improvements in
                            relations with us. He said they always run into trouble. He was asked in
                            Moscow what advance has been made, and he couldn't answer. <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told him he could have said “the <gloss

                            positive answer pretty soon, but he didn't say any more about it. <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he doesn't believe the U.S. should be

                            If we go the hard route, and can keep them quiet, that is what we want.
                                <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said he is keenly aware that we
                            don't want to take the hard route and make them mad. He asked <gloss

                                >K</gloss> said yes; he had been very tough on him. D has asked what
                                <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> thought of the Sino-Soviet problem.
                                <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> had said the Soviets have a big
                            geopolitical problem that no death is going to solve. D had asked <gloss

                        <p>D had said something about Romania<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">See <ref

                            who thought of it. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> had replied that
                            every fundamental decision here is made by the President, and he wasn't
                            going to give D a checklist of who made the various proposals.</p>
                        <p>D had asked whether we had any response from the Chinese on the change in

                            knew as well as he that the Chinese move in very complicated ways (which
                            didn't really give an answer to his question). <gloss target="#t_K1"
                                >K</gloss> said he had been personally much more aloof with D than

                            <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> asked what had been said about Vietnam.
                                <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told him D had said we may not
                            believe it, but the Soviets have a real interest in ending this war, but
                            for different reasons than ours. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told
                            him we have no evidence of this. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said D
                            had said they had been helpful on the shape of the table, to which
                                <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> replied that they were helpful to
                            Hanoi on that. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> gave no encouragement
                            here, and wasn't really very pleasant. He had reminded D that we have a

                        <p>The President said, “The summit and trade they can have, but I'll be
                            damned if they can get the Middle East, etc.” <gloss target="#t_K1"
                                >K</gloss> said he doesn't see what we gain by going to a fall-back

                                >Rogers</persName> to tell <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he thinks D came to see him to let

                            meeting, and to fix an invitation for <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> to see the President. D had said in all previous

                            received by the President. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told D that

                            meeting. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> told the President if <persName

                            the President will have to see him, but if he doesn't, <gloss

                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said D came back to this two or three
                                times—(<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> would love to
                            have an invitation). <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> further doesn't
                            think we should encourage him to ask for an appointment.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said to the President on the Middle
                            East, it would help us if we didn't do anything right now—it could be
                            done in about 10 days to 2 weeks between <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said he didn't
                            know whether <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> will make a
                            formal proposition—he hadn't been in touch with <gloss target="#t_K1"
                                >K</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said waiting makes

                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said the papers had made a big thing
                            about <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> getting a warmer
                            reception than he.<note n="6" xml:id="d86fn6">On September 18, <persName

                            is obvious—all the Middle East had to be silent to him; we have nothing
                            to offer the Africans; and we didn't mention Latin America. He said he
                            felt it was foolish to go up there. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said
                            he didn't think the President got a cool reception; he couldn't count on
                            the newspapers giving such a distorted picture. The President said we
                            said things not calculated to get a warm reception.</p>
                        <p>Getting back to D and Vietnam, <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> asked
                                <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> whether he saw much movement. <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss>'s response was that the fact that D told
                            him about his Paris conversation, and that Hanoi considers that the most
                            useful conversation they have had, he (<gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>)
                            considers positive. D had said in watching the President's news
                            conference, it was clear the President isn't going to make any major
                            concessions, and that it was useful to get this on the table. <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> thinks we will get a move within the next
                            month.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> mentioned the demonstrations coming up
                            on October 15. He said the Democratic National Chairman had been meeting
                            with the doves, at the same time of his press conference, to make
                            Vietnam a political issue. <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said he
                            didn't hit this hard with <persName corresp="#p_HHR1"
                                >Haldeman</persName>, but he feels the real attack should be on
                            them. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> agreed, saying they got us into
                            the war. <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said our people have to start
                            fighting harder. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said the press
                            conference was essential and extremely helpful. He thinks events of the
                            last two or three weeks show the long route cannot possibly work. The
                            President agreed, especially with our 60,000-man withdrawal, reduction
                            of the draft by 50,000 and Ho Chi Minh's death. The doves <pb n="263"
                                xml:id="pg_263" facs="0296"/>and the public are making it impossible
                            to happen. He asked <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>, if in his planning,
                            he could pick this up so that we make the tough move before the 15th of
                            October. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said yes. <gloss target="#t_P1"
                                >P</gloss> said he had been wondering if we shouldn't—he doesn't
                            want to appear to be making the tough move after the 15th just because
                            of the rioting at home. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said there is a
                            problem, however—if Hanoi takes us seriously, and they wouldn't have
                            told Moscow if they weren't taking it seriously, we shouldn't confuse
                            them. If we want them to make the move, we should give them time—two
                            weeks. His only worry is that if we went ahead with the tough move
                            before the 15th—and there is a 10% chance Hanoi might want to move, if
                            we hit them before they have a chance to make the move, it will look as
                            if we tricked them. He said the President might want to consider another
                            press conference before the 15th or a television report, saying “these
                            people (demonstrators, etc.) are dividing the country and making it
                            impossible to settle the problem on a reasonable basis.” <gloss
                                target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said he would just as soon have them
                            demonstrate against the plan. If we went ahead and moved, the country is
                            going to take a dimmer view after the move than before. <gloss
                                target="#t_P1">P</gloss> would like to nip it before the first
                            demonstration, because there will be another one on November 15. <gloss

                                >K</gloss> said as an assistant, he had to give <gloss
                                target="#t_P1">P</gloss> the dark side. He suggested again the
                            possibility of <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> going on television
                            before the demonstration—possibly around Oct 10.</p>

                                Middle East. Secretary responded that Mrs. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> did not agree to do anything:
                                that she was very firm in her position that Arabs must make it
                                completely clear that they intend to seek a lasting peace with
                                Israel and to renounce their previously stated goal of eventual
                                destruction of Israel. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> said he was certain this could be
                                accomplished but that he thought the United States should do more to
                                make Israel agree to responsible terms. Secretary explained that we
                                are not in a position to force Israel to accept a settlement.
                                Secretary then asked <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>

                                    with Ralph Bunche serving as UN Acting Mediator. The
                                    negotiations involved separate meetings on substantive items

                                Secretary stated that the United States felt that it might provide a

                                Purpose of meeting would be to work toward a common Soviet-U.S.
                                position paper on basis of following elements: (1) a binding
                                commitment to a durable and permanent peace; (2) acceptance of
                                principle of choice for refugees based on an annual quota to be
                                repatriated and an understanding on an overall limitation; (3)

                                    >Tiran</hi>] and Suez; (4) parties would be expected to

                                arrangements in Sharm El-Shaikh; (b) final disposition of Gaza, and
                                (c) arrangements of <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0298"

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked Secretary how
                                he thought the matter should proceed from that point on. Secretary
                                said that if this procedure could be agreed upon between Soviet
                                Union and United States it would then be forwarded to four powers
                                for their consideration at a meeting toward end of October and that
                                thereafter four powers would attempt to arrange for beginning of
                                negotiations based on Rhodes formula sometime in November, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> agreed that this an
                                acceptable procedure seriously to consider.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asked questions
                                on specific issues. He asked if proposal Secretary made suggested
                                that border between Egypt and Israel would be pre-1967 border.
                                Secretary said he not in a position to make that commitment but
                                thought something along those lines might be worked out, assuming
                                Sharm El-Shaikh issue and other aspects above could be
                                satisfactorily resolved. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> then repeated Soviet position on Sharm
                                El-Shaikh to which Secretary replied that he thought that was a
                                matter which should be thoroughly discussed in negotiations between
                                the parties.</item>

                            <item>
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> also asked reasons
                                for our opposition to reference to Constantinople convention.
                                Secretary set forth our reasoning stating that he saw no reason to
                                make reference to another document in agreement and, furthermore, it
                                might be construed to be an indirect way of giving UAR unilateral
                                right to close canal to Israel at any time it thought it might be in
                                interest of their national defense. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> said he had worked matter out very carefully
                                with UAR and that express language in the treaty provides there
                                could be no discrimination. He felt that it provided a stronger
                                basis for assurance to Israel than otherwise. Secretary told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> we could exchange
                                views on legal aspects but if Soviet position was that Israel could
                                have free passage through Suez Canal on same basis as all other
                                nationals without any possibility of discrimination he felt sure a
                                formulation could be worked out.</item>

                                suggested ceiling of 100,000 over a ten year period. Secretary under
                                impression that from standpoint of Soviet Union they felt some
                                solution could be worked out along those lines although this was not
                                explicitly stated.</item>

                                question, Secretary indicated that subject of West Bank also a
                                matter that should be left open to negotiation between Israel and
                                Jordan. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> did not
                                oppose the suggestion.</item>

                            <item>Secretary said that it position of United States that Jerusalem
                                should be a united city and that question of her sovereignty should
                                be a matter of negotiations between parties at a later date.
                                Secretary <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0299"/>indicated that
                                Israel's position was that it would be unwilling to relinquish all
                                or any part of its claimed sovereignty over Jerusalem.</item>

                            <item>Secretary told <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that
                                discussion they were having was of a tentative nature and that no
                                final agreement could be reached between Soviet Union and United
                                States until matter reduced to writing so that there could be no
                                possible misunderstanding between them. Secretary pointed out that
                                in interest of our future relations it is quite important that
                                before any agreement is reached that we clearly understand exactly
                                what is involved. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                                said that he agreed with that and would be pleased to meet with

                        </list>
                        <p>In the last two months, the increase in Sino-Soviet tensions has led the
                            Soviets to sound out numerous American contacts on their attitude toward
                            a possible Soviet air strike against China's nuclear/missile facilities
                            or toward other Soviet military actions. These probes have varied in
                            character from point-blank questioning of our reaction to provocative
                            musings by Soviets over what they might be forced to do against the
                            Chinese, including the use of nuclear weapons. Some of these contacts
                            have featured adamant denials that the Soviets were planning any
                            military moves—thereby keeping the entire issue alive. (Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' Memorandum on this

                        <p>Our contingency planning for major Sino-Soviet hostilities is well along,
                            and <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration of a basic policy
                            paper on the Sino-Soviet dispute is scheduled for October 8.<note n="2"

                        </p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, I am concerned about our response to these probes. The Soviets
                            may be quite uncertain over their China policy, and our reactions could
                            figure in their calculations. Second, the Soviets may be using us to
                            generate an impression in China and the world that we are being
                            consulted in secret and would look with equanimity on their military
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>A related issue is the shifting Soviet attitude on Chinese representation
                            in the UN. We have had two indications that the Soviets, in an effort to
                            keep the Chinese Communists out of the UN through indirection, are
                            dangling the prospect before us of cooperation on the representation
                            issue. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, in his UN speech,
                            of course failed to mention Peking's admission for the first time.<note

                                countries except the People's Republic of China and also avoided the
                                issue of UN membership for the PRC. (United Nations, General

                        </p>
                        <p>I believe we should make clear that we are not playing along with these
                            tactics, in pursuance of your policy of avoiding the appearance of
                            siding with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The principal gain in making our position clear would be in our stance
                            with respect to China. The benefits would be long rather than
                            short-term, but they may be none the less real. Behavior of Chinese
                            Communist diplomats in recent months strongly suggests the existence of
                            a body of opinion, presently submerged by Mao's doctrinal views, which
                            might wish to put US/Chinese relations on a more rational and less
                            ideological basis than has been true for the past two decades.</p>

                            <p>Soviet Embassy Second Secretary Davydov brought up the idea of a
                                Soviet attack on Chinese nuclear facilities in a Washington luncheon
                                conversation with a Department officer on August 18. I am enclosing
                                the memorandum of conversation<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">Attached
                                    but not printed.</note> which details the rationale for such a
                                move which he adduced in asking what the United States reaction
                                might be.</p>
                            <p>Davydov's conversation was unusual for the length of the argument
                                that he presented for such a Soviet course of action. None of the
                                other occasional references to the idea in talks with Soviets which
                                have come to our attention have spelled out such a
                                justification.</p>

                                <item>—Italian Communist Rossana Rossanda has claimed that, in July,
                                    the Italian Communist leadership received a message from Moscow
                                    asking how the Italians would react if, in self-defense, the
                                    Soviet Union were forced to make a preventive strike against
                                    Chinese missile and atomic installations. On the basis of past
                                    experience, Rossanda is not to be taken too literally as a
                                    reporter, and a more accurate version of her information may be
                                    contained in a Finnish Communist account of the consultations in
                                    Moscow at the World Communist Conference in June. According to
                                    this report, a Soviet leader then asserted that the <gloss

                                    China an immediate mortal blow (presumably more than just a
                                    strike at nuclear facilities), but did not wish to do something
                                    so “un-Leninist,” except as an extreme defensive measure.</item>

                                    (nature of the blow not specified) on China might be. The same

                                    to the American's latest query two weeks ago, the editor merely
                                    said that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was trying
                                    to better its relations with China. In July Sidney Liu of <hi

                                <item>—A Soviet communication to foreign Communist parties in early

                                    Sino-Soviet relations, but neither of the two accounts of the
                                    message that we have indicates that it discussed such specific
                                    courses of action as a strike against Chinese nuclear
                                    facilities.</item>

                                    by Southeast Asia Chief Kapitsa of the Foreign Ministry who
                                    insisted to a Canadian newsman that a Soviet strike against
                                    Chinese nuclear targets was “unthinkable” and that the very idea
                                    was an invention of the Western press.</item>

                            <p>It is extremely unlikely that Davydov would be privy to top-level
                                Soviet discussions on this matter, much less any decisions taken.
                                Rather, it is likely that he has been given the job of getting as
                                much information as he can on American attitudes on the China issue,
                                and his questioning about the strike hypothesis was in the context
                                of trying to elicit discussion of American views of Sino-Soviet
                                relations. The idea of a strike against Chinese nuclear targets is
                                one which has been mentioned in the United States press and talked
                                about among diplomats and newsmen in Washington. Moreover, Davydov
                                had been asked—at a meeting with Congressional interns a few days
                                before the above cited luncheon—what he thought the United States
                                attitude ought to be in the event of a Sino-Soviet war, and thus
                                would have had occasion to have thought through some of the
                                argumentation he used in the memorandum.</p>
                            <p>What emerges clearly from the foregoing evidence—as well as from
                                Soviet leaders' speeches, from Moscow's propaganda, and from
                                clandestine source reports on Soviet diplomatic anxieties—is an
                                obvious sense of Soviet concern over troubles with China and of
                                great interest in how others view Sino-Soviet tensions. What remains
                                doubtful is whether the Soviets have ordered their officials
                                systematically to canvass for reactions to a specific potential
                                course of action—attack on Chinese nuclear targets. Nevertheless,
                                the Department has considered the possibility that Davydov's
                                conversation might have been the first move in such a probing
                                operation, and, with that in view, has alerted key American posts
                                abroad to be certain to report analogous conversations. The only
                                response so far was from the American Embassy in <pb n="270"
                                    xml:id="pg_270" facs="0303"/>Rome. A Soviet First Secretary told
                                Italian officials he foresaw new and more serious incidents; he was
                                not reported to have sought reactions and there was no reference in
                                the report to the idea of a strike against Chinese nuclear
                                facilities.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of a cluster of such reports in a relatively short
                                time, it would appear that Davydov's recent conversation, as well as
                                the remarks in Boston five months ago, are curiosities rather than
                                signals. It is certain that Moscow remains preoccupied with its
                                Chinese problem, and the Kremlin is probably reviewing all of its
                                options. Thus the possibility of a Soviet strike at Chinese nuclear
                                facilities cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, my advisers and I do
                                not believe such a move to be probable. The Soviets would have to
                                weigh the risk of triggering an all-out war with China, a war for
                                which the Soviets are not likely to believe themselves yet well
                                prepared despite their buildup since 1965. Moreover, they would not
                                be sure of getting the entire inventory of Chinese bombs, and would
                                in any case face the prospect that the Chinese would most likely
                                rebuild their nuclear arsenal with renewed determination.</p>

                                dispute notes that a conventional air strike aimed at destroying
                                China's missile and nuclear facilities might be the most attractive
                                military option available to Moscow, if the Soviets believed that
                                they could do this without getting involved in a prolonged and
                                full-scale war. The National Intelligence Estimate did not think it
                                likely that the Kremlin would reach this conclusion, but felt that
                                there was some chance that it would. Considering all of the
                                military, political, economic, foreign policy, and ideological
                                implications of any such Soviet attack, the Department's analysts
                                judge that the chances of this particular course of action are still
                                substantially less than fifty-fifty and that Sino-Soviet conflict,
                                if it does occur, might more likely result from escalation of border
                                clashes. That assessment seems reasonable to me.</p>

                            Joe's new formula—subject to agreement on Gaza, Sharm al-Shaikh and
                            demilitarization, the UAR-Israel boundary would be the pre-war line. Joe

                            his private conversations with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"

                            business, I fear that he may not have a chance to do so. The part of the
                            conversation which focused on the Middle East has been reported,<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">See <ref target="#d87">Document

                            also discussed. I want in this letter to give you something of the
                            flavor of the conversation on these points as conveyed to a small group
                            of us by the Secretary on September 27.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            had expressed considerable concern regarding the power of the
                            “military-industrial complex” in the United States. He questioned
                            whether this complex is interested in arms control and disarmament, and
                            he also reiterated the doubts he had earlier expressed as to the
                            intentions of the Administration given the latter's policy on <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s and <gloss target="#t_MIRV1"
                                >MIRV</gloss>. The Secretary said that he patiently explained to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> that firms engaged in
                            the manufacture of munitions and other military equipment can easily
                            switch to production of other products needed in the civilian economy.
                            He said he also sought to underline the genuine interest of the
                            Administration in opening <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> without
                            further delay. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied
                            that he would transmit these observations “to the Central Committee,”
                            but the Secretary <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0308"/>seemed
                            uncertain whether he had succeeded in dissipating <persName

                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s initiative. He said that he
                            was gratified to know from the statements of high officials that the US
                            Government does not wish to see an aggravation of the Sino-Soviet
                            conflict and does not seek to exploit this conflict for its own
                            purposes. Nonetheless, he observed that other actions and statements of
                            the US side raise suspicions that the US Government in fact seeks
                            advantage from the dispute. The Secretary asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to provide specific examples of
                            such actions and statements. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> furnished no examples, perhaps because he did
                            not wish to pursue what could easily have developed into a rather
                            contentious conversation.</p>
                        <p>On Berlin and the possibility of quadripartite talks, the Secretary
                            sought to elicit some clarification of the opaque Soviet response to the
                            recent tripartite démarche.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">For the September

                                main points as follows: “Talks would be limited to the four powers
                                and would concern West Berlin; the question must be approached from
                                the standpoint of European security, and the sovereignty and
                                legitimate interests of East Germany; it is impossible not to take
                                into account that West Berlin's lines of communication are ‘along
                                the lines of communication of the GDR;' a normalization of relations
                                between the GDR and Bonn proceed from the basis of ‘international
                                law,' and the principles of the Bucharest and Budapest declarations
                                of the Warsaw Pact (i.e., recognition of East Germany, inviolability
                                of borders, etc.).”</note> As in the earlier discussion of Berlin on

                            meetings were not very productive on substance (with the possible
                            exception of the Middle East), they succeeded in permitting the two men
                            to get to know each other. Given the apparent Soviet uncertainties

                            coming up with a common document during their final meeting in New York.
                            The Soviet strategy now appears to be to get a commitment to total
                            Israeli withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza to the pre-war lines in return
                            for their agreeing to Rhodes type negotiations (interpreted the Arab
                            way) and peace after Israeli withdrawal has been completed and without
                            an explicit commitment to control the fedayeen. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> does not believe that this is a
                            satisfactory deal and has therefore held basically to our present
                            position and did not put our fallback position on the table. The talks

                                    because of disagreement on a number of other points in the
                                    package. On the Rhodes formula, the Secretary made clear that we
                                    are not insisting on a joint meeting of the parties at the
                                    outset and that it was advantageous not to be too precise on the
                                    details so that both parties can justify it. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had a different set of

                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had
                                    explained the advantages of ambiguity.</item>

                                    continue to insist that a juridical state of peace can come only
                                    after all Israeli withdrawals are completed. This is consistent
                                    with the longstanding Arab view. The Israelis, on the other
                                    hand, refuse to withdraw an inch until peace is established and

                        <p>On October 7, 1969, President's Assistant for National Security Affairs
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName> sent
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> a paper entitled,
                            “The Modern World, A Single ‘Strategic Theater,'” dated September 29,
                            1969. The paper was written by Fritz Kraemer, whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> described as “an acquaintance
                            of mine.” <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s covering
                            memorandum explained that, “Although I do not agree with its every last
                            word, it does define the problem we face—the generally deteriorating
                            strategic position of the United States during the past decade.” The
                            paper, printed in <ref target="frus1969-76v01#d39">
                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1969–1976, volume I,

                            read with great interest by <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                            >Nixon</persName>, who wrote numerous marginal comments. Next to the

                                >Nixon</persName> wrote “good analysis.” The section examines the
                            triangular relationship among the United States, the Soviet Union, and
                            China as follows:</p>

                            deserves to be made in the general context I have chosen: The Soviets
                            are developing some genuine fear of Red China and its intractable
                            leaders. They might, therefore, feel impelled by self-restraint to seek
                            a <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> Kremlin/Washington détente, and even
                            make certain concessions to the US as a conceivable future ally,
                            semi-ally or at least friendly ‘neutral' in a Soviet-Chinese
                            confrontation. The entire Soviet assessment, however, of the weight and
                            value of the United States as a friend or foe, will depend very largely
                            on their considering us either strong-willed or else weak in purpose and
                            resolve. The realists in the Kremlin may now be ‘taking our measure,’
                            and a US yielding, and reluctant to act on all fronts, will appear less
                            interesting and important to them as a factor in the international power
                            struggle than a super power obviously able and willing to use its
                            strength.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> opened the
                            conversation by handing the President a brief announcement suggesting
                            November 17th as the opening of the <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss> talks, and suggesting Helsinki as the place. The
                            President asked why Helsinki—he preferred Vienna. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that it did not make a
                            great deal of difference to the Soviet Union, but since Helsinki had
                            been proposed as one of the places by the Secretary of State in June,
                            they decided to go along with that. The President said the Secretary of
                            State had been under instructions to point out the difficulties of
                            Helsinki. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            replied that all the Secretary of State had said to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was, “to hell with ‘Sinki,”
                            which is not a diplomatic suggestion. If the United States preferred
                            some other place, this should not be too difficult.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked the Ambassador
                            what they meant by preliminary discussion. He replied that this meant
                            only the first phase of the discussions, and had no particular
                            significance. But Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> suggested that one possible way of handling it
                            would be by beginning in Helsinki and then moving on to Vienna. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out to the
                            Ambassador that we had to consult some Allies, but that there seemed to
                            be no insuperable difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The President then said it would be dangerous if the talks were only a
                            series of platitudes. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> replied that there <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280"
                                facs="0313"/>would be specific suggestions, depending on the range
                            of our proposals, and they would probably be put in the form of several
                            options.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that President <persName corresp="#p_PNV1"
                                >Podgorny</persName> paid close attention to good relationships with
                            the United States, and valued this private contact that had been
                            established, but they wanted the President to hear directly their view
                            of international relations. The Ambassador then read the attached Aide
                            Mémoire to the President. After he was through reading the Aide Mémoire,
                            the President pulled out a yellow pad, handed it to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and said, “you'd better take
                            some notes,” and began to speak almost uninterruptedly for half an
                            hour.</p>
                        <p>The President began by saying to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>, “you have been candid, and I will be equally
                            so. I, too, am disappointed in US-Soviet relations. I am today, in
                            office for nine months. The babies should have been born; instead, there
                            have been several miscarriages. I recognize that the future of my
                            country and of the world depends on the success the Soviet Union has in
                            bringing us closer together. We have not done well. Let me point out
                            why.”</p>

                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>, have talked, but the Soviets have been taking
                            a hard position based on total withdrawal without asking a similar
                            sacrifice from the UAR. The President pointed out that the Soviet client
                            had lost the war, had lost the territory, and was in no position to be
                            extremely aggressive. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the President was suggesting that
                            total withdrawal was no longer acceptable, and why a UN force was not
                            adequate. The President said that in light of the experience with the
                            other UN force, one would have to understand and take account of the
                            Israeli position. We are not intransigent, the President added, and you
                            must not be. If you are willing to press your client, we may be able to
                            make some suggestions to Israel. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> began to argue and the President cut him off by
                            saying these were technical issues which should be discussed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Turning to <hi rend="italic">trade, European security and Berlin</hi>,
                            the President said that these could be dealt with later at a very high
                            level, if we can make a breakthrough somewhere. The Ambassador asked,
                            “how do we make a breakthrough?”</p>
                        <p>The President ignored him and turned to <hi rend="italic">China</hi>. He
                            said, “Look to the future of Asia—what will Asia be 25 years from now?
                            China will be in a position of immense power and we cannot have it
                            without communication. Anything we have done or are doing with respect
                            to China is in no sense designed to embarrass the Soviet Union. On the
                            contrary, China and the United States cannot tolerate a situation to
                            develop where we are enemies, anymore than we want to be permanent
                            enemies of the Soviet Union. Therefore, we expect to make moves in trade
                            and exchange of persons and eventually in diplomacy. As the Ambassador
                            has said <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0314"/>himself, there are
                            enough blocs in the world without contributing to another one. He
                            repeated this was not directed against the Soviet Union. Within 10
                            years, China will be a nuclear power, capable of terrorizing many other
                            countries. The time is running out when the Soviet Union and the United
                            States can build a different kind of world. The only beneficiary, then,
                            of U.S.-Soviet disagreement over Vietnam is China. And, therefore, this
                            is the last opportunity to settle these disputes.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to Vietnam. He said that prior to the bombing
                            halt, “which you are aware will be one year old on November 1st,”
                            Ambassadors Bohlen, <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and
                            Harriman had pointed out that the Soviet Union could do nothing as long
                            as the United States was bombing a fellow Socialist country, and that it
                            would be very active afterwards. The bombing halt was agreed to and the
                            Soviet Union has done nothing.</p>
                        <p>Of course, the President said, we now had an oblong table to the
                            attainment of which the Soviet Union contributed something, but the U.S.
                            did not consider that a great achievement. All conciliatory moves for
                            the past year had been made by the United States. The President
                            enumerated them.</p>
                        <p>The President said he therefore had concluded that maybe the Soviet Union
                            did not want to end the war in Vietnam. They may think that they can
                            break the President; they may believe that the U.S. domestic situation
                            is unmanageable; they may think that the war in Vietnam costs the Soviet
                            Union only a small amount of money and costs the U.S. a great many
                            lives. The President did not propose to argue with the Soviet
                            assessment. As a great power, it had the right to take its position. On
                            the other hand, the Ambassador had to understand the following: the
                            Soviet Union would be stuck with the President for the next three years
                            and three months, and the President would keep in mind what was being
                            done right now. If the Soviet Union would not help us to get peace, the
                            U.S. would have to pursue its own methods for bringing the war to an
                            end. It could not allow a talk-fight strategy without taking action.</p>
                        <p>The President said he hoped that the Ambassador would understand that
                            such measures would not be directed against the Soviet Union, but would
                            be in the U.S. interest of achieving peace. The U.S. recognized that a
                            settlement must reflect the real situation. It recognized the right of
                            all Vietnamese to participate in the political process. But up to now,
                            there had been a complete refusal of North Vietnam to make its own
                            proposals in order to have any serious discussion.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that all the Ambassador had done was to repeat
                            the same tired old slogans that the North Vietnamese had made already
                            six months ago, and which he knew very well could lead nowhere. It was
                            time to get discussions started. The humiliation of a defeat was
                            absolutely unacceptable. The President recognized that the Soviet <pb
                                n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0315"/>leaders were tough and
                            courageous, but so was he. He told Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that he hoped that he would
                            not mind this serious talk.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> said he did not
                            believe much in personal diplomacy, and he recognized that the
                            Ambassador was a strong defender of the interests of his own country.
                            The President pointed out that if the Soviet Union found it possible to
                            do something in Vietnam, and the Vietnam war ended, the U.S. might do
                            something dramatic to improve Soviet-U.S. relations, indeed something
                            more dramatic than they could now imagine. But until then, real progress
                            would be difficult.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether
                            this meant that there could be no progress. The President replied that
                            progress was possible, but it would have to be confined essentially to
                            what was attainable in diplomatic channels. He said that he was very
                            happy to have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            use the channel through Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>, and he would be prepared to talk to the
                            Ambassador personally. He reiterated that the war could drag on, in
                            which case the U.S. would find its own way to bring it to an end. There
                            was no sense repeating the proposals of the last six months. However, he
                            said, in the meantime, while the situation continued, we could all keep
                            our tone down and talk correctly to each other. It would help, and would
                            lay the basis for further progress, perhaps later on when conditions
                            were more propitious.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the whole world wanted us to get together. He too
                            wanted nothing so much as to have his Administration remembered as a
                            watershed in U.S.-Soviet relations, but we would not hold still for
                            being “diddled” to death in Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn2">

                            <p>While in Moscow [I] had meetings with the Soviet leaders in the
                                course of which we discussed questions of relations between the

                            <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0316"/>
                            <p>The President is aware of the importance with which Soviet-American
                                relations are viewed by our side and of the significance attached to
                                them in Moscow. Enough time has now passed since the inauguration of
                                the new administration in the United States to permit an evaluation
                                of the state of Soviet-American relations in the light of the
                                exchange of opinion that has since taken place between our
                                Governments, as well as of the events that have occurred in the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>I am instructed to frankly inform the President that Moscow is not
                                satisfied with the present state of relations between the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US. One gets the
                                impression that the American side, while declaring in general words
                                that it is ready to pursue negotiations with the Soviet Union,
                                evades, in fact, concrete discussion of a whole number of major
                                questions, such as measures to be taken to ensure that allied
                                agreements reflecting the results of World War II and outlining
                                steps for securing peace be put into life; greater coordination of
                                our actions aimed at settling in practice the Middle East conflict,
                                as well as certain concrete questions of bilateral Soviet-American
                                relations, in particular, that of trade. Moreover, in a number of
                                cases the American side has taken steps which obviously run counter
                                to the declarations in favor of improving relations between our
                                countries. All this cannot but alert us and, in any case, cannot
                                contribute to better trust which is so necessary for relations
                                between our Governments if we are indeed to make progress in
                                removing the abnormalities that have piled up in our relations in
                                the past, and in settling major international issues fraught with
                                dangerous crises.</p>
                            <p>With this in mind the Soviet Government decided to outline for the
                                President its considerations on a number of concrete questions.</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>
                                    <p>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] It is known, for example, that
                                        the Soviet Government has expressed readiness to follow the
                                        path that would facilitate doing away with the existing
                                        military blocks and groupings which, without doubt, would
                                        make a most positive impact on the world situation.
                                        Unfortunately, one has to conclude that those statements
                                        have not met a positive response from the US Government. On
                                        the contrary, it is noted in Moscow that the activity of
                                            <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is now on the
                                        increase.</p>
                                    <p>Or take, for instance, the question of drawing a line through
                                        the vestiges of the Second World War in Europe and fixating
                                        the situation that has developed there. We on our part have
                                        always expressed readiness and proposed concrete ways for a
                                        just settlement of the questions involved, with due regard
                                        to the existing realities. The American side, however, acts
                                        contrary to the obligations assumed by the United States
                                        under the Allied agreements. Why could not the US, together
                                        with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as great
                                        powers and allies in the past war, make necessary efforts at
                                        last in that important field?</p>
                                    <p>The Soviet side stands prepared now to start an exchange of
                                        views with the US also on the question of West Berlin. Such
                                        an exchange of <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0317"
                                        />views, in our opinion, can be useful if both sides are
                                        guided by the aim of contributing to a relaxation of tension
                                        in Europe and of preventing in the future frictions and
                                        complications dangerous for the maintenance of peace and
                                        stability in Europe.</p>

                                    <p>It is also known that the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                            >USSR</gloss> have long been conducting an exchange of
                                        views on Middle East settlement We would like to say with
                                        all frankness, however, that, in our opinion, there has been
                                        no significant progress in this matter so far, while the
                                        situation in the Middle East in the meantime, far from
                                        getting normalized, is further deteriorating. In our deep
                                        conviction, such a course of events in no small degree is
                                        due to the failure on the part of the US to make adequate
                                        efforts to bring to an end the present arrogant behaviour of
                                        Israel which deliberately aggravates the situation and is
                                        wrecking a settlement.</p>
                                    <p>Moscow would like to hope that the President will give this
                                        question all due attention and that appropriate steps will
                                        be taken from the American side to put an end to Israel's
                                        obstructionism which would pave the way toward achieving a
                                        just settlement in the Middle East.</p>

                                    <p>In Moscow development of events around Vietnam is being
                                        watched closely as before.</p>
                                    <p>The Soviet Union, as in the past, is interested in a
                                        speediest peaceful settlement of the Vietnam conflict
                                        through negotiations and on the basis of respect for the
                                        rights and aspirations of the Vietnamese people. We can
                                        responsibly state that the position of our Vietnamese
                                        friends is the same.</p>
                                    <p>I would like to recall in this connection a concrete program
                                        of just and peaceful settlement, put forward by the
                                        Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the
                                        National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to
                                        emphasize, too, that the stubborn resistance of the American
                                        side to the creation of a coalition government in South
                                        Vietnam which would be based on the actual pattern of
                                        political forces there cannot but evoke questions as to the
                                        actual meaning of statements about the US desire to end the
                                        war in Vietnam and to achieve a political settlement of that
                                        conflict. These questions also arise in view of the fact
                                        that parallel to the Paris Peace Talks the US is conducting
                                        wide preparations for continuing the war in Vietnam.</p>
                                    <p>Due note has been taken in Moscow, of course, of the hints by
                                        the American representatives about possible use by the
                                        United States of some “alternate” methods of solving the
                                        Vietnam question. Such hints cannot be regarded in any other
                                        way but as a rather open threat addressed to the DRV and the
                                        Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam.</p>
                                    <p>If that is so Moscow feels that the President should be
                                        frankly told that the method of solving the Vietnam question
                                        through the use <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0318"/>of
                                        military force is not only without perspective, but also
                                        extremely dangerous.</p>
                                    <p>We hope that the United States will soberly weigh all factors
                                        connected with the continuation of the Vietnam conflict and
                                        will show a constructive approach to its solution through
                                        negotiation, on the basis of recognition of the unalienable
                                        right of the Vietnamese people to solve their matters by
                                        themselves and of withdrawal of the American troops from
                                        Vietnam.</p>

                                    <p>Some time back due note was taken in Moscow of the assurances
                                        by American leaders to the effect that the United States was
                                        not interested in any aggravation of conflict between the
                                        Ch.P.R. and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                        did not have any intention to use Soviet-Chinese relations
                                        to the detriment of the Soviet Union. We, on our part,
                                        assured the President that we did not have any intention,
                                        either, to make use of difficulties in the relations between
                                        the USA and the Ch.P.R. Those American assurances were
                                        received in Moscow as a sign of sober realization by the US
                                        Government that it would be unrealistic to stake on the use
                                        of the problem of Soviet-Chinese relations for bringing
                                        pressure to bear upon the Soviet Union and for getting
                                        one-sided concessions from us.</p>
                                    <p>If someone in the United States is tempted to make profit
                                        from Soviet-Chinese relations at the Soviet Union's expense,
                                        and there are some signs of that, then we would like to
                                        frankly warn in advance that such line of conduct, if
                                        pursued, can lead to a very grave miscalculation and is in
                                        no way consistent with the goal of better relations between
                                        the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>

                                    <p>In conclusion I would like to say that the Soviet leaders who
                                        attach great significance to improving relations with the
                                        United States, would like to know the President's own
                                        opinion on the above mentioned questions, as well as on
                                        concrete steps which the American side would be ready to
                                        take in that direction.</p>
                                    <p>I would also like to tell the President that the Soviet
                                        leaders continue to attach great importance not only to
                                        official but also to the existing unofficial contacts with
                                        him for a confidential exchange of opinion on questions of
                                        mutual interest.</p>

                            message. Then if the Vietnam thing is raised (try to get it raised) the

                                >K</gloss> to shake his head and say “I am sorry, Mr. Ambassador,
                            but he is out of control. Mr. Ambassador, as you know, I am very close
                            to the President, and you don't know this man—he's been through more
                            than any of the rest of us put together. He's made up his mind and
                            unless there's some movement,” just shake your head and walk out. He's
                            probably right now figuring out what was said. <gloss target="#t_K1"

                            freedom of action is so circumscribed that you can't do anything or
                            Hanoi is out of control. The <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> said he

                            says on the basis of giving the people free choice. In the next

                            the notes on the other. D said there was no hurry—at <gloss

                                >K</gloss> said when he looked at his notes, he forgot the reduction
                            in military activity. D noticed and said that the notes kept saying
                            “they, they, they.” <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said “they” refers
                            to D's leaders. D pointed out another instance where it said “on the

                            was also directed to D's leaders. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said
                            he had no doubt about D's understanding—this was true all the way
                            through—the reference to D's leaders. D said this was his impression. On
                            page 2, line 3 it mentions the Soviet people. <gloss target="#t_K1"
                                >K</gloss> again said this should be “leaders.” <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said the President was talking about
                            himself. D said he mentioned himself and gave the name of three leaders.
                                <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said D's notes were better than his.
                            D said the President mentioned Bohlen, <persName corresp="#p_TLET1"
                                >Thompson</persName>, Harriman and [omission in the source text],
                            not D specifically. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said that was

                            said he would correct his notes. Then in paragraph 3, D said the
                            President mentioned that he was very happy to see the Ambassador. D
                            understood that he was happy rather to meet with <persName

                            misunderstood that. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> had an occasion to
                            talk with the President this morning—what he said was “that channel
                            should be if the problem got solved.” D said—that now <gloss
                                target="#t_K1">K</gloss> and he really have nothing to discuss
                            unless D has something to say. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said that
                            was supposed to mean on important matters. D's impression was that the
                            President didn't specifically limit D and <gloss target="#t_K1"

                            limitation. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> said that was not the
                            intention. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> explained that D could see
                            the President on something very important and if the other thing were
                            settled, quite frequently. <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss> talked with
                            the <gloss target="#t_P1">P</gloss> after D was in. The Pres. is very
                            agreeable to keep this channel open. D said as it is here, he may have
                            to go the other way from now on but would like to go on with <gloss

                            indictment, although moderate in tone. Most of the points in the Soviet
                            complaint against us have recently been made by other Soviet officials
                            and in the Soviet press. It may well be that this is how the Soviet
                            leaders in fact see our conduct; and they are partly correct: we have by
                            and large kept aloof and held our ground on such issues as the Middle
                            East (<persName corresp="#p_MG7">Golda Meir</persName> to the contrary
                            notwithstanding) and Europe. But we have probably not done as well as we

                                of the threat element in our current posture and to throw out enough

                            cool attitude, many others are pure Soviet propaganda fare. I doubt that
                            we need to pay attention to complaints about <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> or about our failure to act in accordance with World
                            War II “obligations.” By the same token, it is curious that certain of
                            our alleged “sins” were omitted, e.g. our supposed arms buildup as
                            reflected in the Safeguard decision.<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">See <ref

                                    Their response was relatively mild (“shortsighted … extremely

                                    your comments might just give them ammunition to use in Hanoi in
                                    lobbying for a more flexible position. The Soviets may argue in
                                    Hanoi that only a token concession—especially when magnified by
                                    our press—would be sufficient to dissuade us from drastic action
                                    or give us a pretext to back away from our warnings. We should
                                    probably find a way to signal that token concessions would be
                                    inadequate. In any event, it will be essential to continue
                                    backing up our verbal warnings with our present military

                                <p>On the substantive Vietnam issues, I could find nothing new in

                                    asserted that their Vietnamese friends favor this too. Even if
                                    that is so—and Pham Van Dong who just completed a visit to
                                    Moscow may have given the green light for use of the phrase—it
                                    gives us nothing to go on in the absence of concrete adjustments
                                    in the Communist position.</p>

                                They agreed in much the same vague terms used in <persName

                                play us off against each other. I believe we would do best to keep

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that, with

                                the event that the Sino-Soviet dispute moved into a situation
                                involving hostilities. At the time it was begun, the prospects of a
                                clash between Moscow and Peking seemed greater than they are
                                today—perhaps the Soviets were actively considering taking some form
                                of action, but now have resolved not to do so, or to defer pending
                                the outcome of the talks in Peking.” (National Archives, <persName

                        <p>Cargo then went over the recommended changes. (1) The paper will be
                            modified to convey the idea that a Soviet “victory” over mainland <pb

                                >CPR</gloss> government. (2) With respect to U.S. actions in Vietnam
                            (as related to Sino-Soviet hostilities), the paper will avoid the
                            impression that a U.S. blockade of Haiphong would serve as a retaliatory
                            measure against a Soviet blockade of Hong Kong (although that may give
                            the U.S. a pretext). The central idea should be that we will use a
                            blockade on the basis of what it would do for us in Vietnam, independent
                            of its relationship to a situation of Sino-Soviet hostilities.</p>

                            wondered if the whole paper could be incorporated in the <gloss

                            stressing that it is contingent upon Soviet agreement to equally
                            specific language on peace and to need for Rhodes-type negotiations

                            open and that Moscow would want document to be more specific and

                                first subsequent Washington meeting we suggested modified language
                                to Soviets in attempt to reflect our common views on how to deal
                                with questions of Tiran, Canal, and refugees. We also proposed a
                                concept for dealing with what US-Soviet discussions have identified
                                as central issues, namely: peace, withdrawal and boundaries, and
                                practical security arrangements. As <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                spelled out some of timetable and some of procedure. We feel this
                                should be left to parties, and omission of old Point 2 has
                                additional advantage of avoiding whole problem of timing of

                                neutral language to which <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                    >Sisco</persName> had been referring since July. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> emphasized that new language
                                intended not to prejudice position of either side on these points.
                                Although <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> frequently
                                said US position is one-sided, he would see we are not trying to
                                prejudice size or location of DMZs or specify any particular type of
                                security arrangements or options re disposition of Gaza. US not
                                proposing use of UN facilities to police DMZs, neither are we ruling
                                out UN facilities. We are trying to find neutral formulations which
                                do not prejudice either side's position. Formulation makes clear
                                that Israel's interest in Sharm al-Shaykh area is confined to
                                practical question of assuring free navigation through Tiran.
                                Formulation also reflects fact that Israel has legitimate security
                                concern in Gaza and should have voice on matter, and this in turn is
                                inseparable in our judgment from disposition of Gaza, where
                                sovereignty has been in abeyance for 20 years.</item>

                                al-Shaykh and Gaza) and other subjects will develop in exchanges
                                between parties. This will help US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                                additional suggestion for dealing with the one point which both US
                                and Soviets recognize cannot be left uncovered: interdependence of
                                UAR and Jordan aspects. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                                said this interdependence is particularly underscored by our
                                discussion of refugee point. We think question of interrelationship
                                can be taken care of by adding one simple paragraph to our
                                non-substantive point on refugees of Oct 10. We believe that our
                                paragraph makes clear that we are dealing with what <persName

                                would be understood that the accord between the UAR and Israel would
                                be paralleled by an accord between Jordan and Israel, which would
                                include agreement on a just solution of the refugee problem.
                                Implementation of both accords would begin only after agreement had

                                remark that US not prepared to negotiate the five elements of

                                band had been stretched to fullest extent. Noted that US has engaged

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> raised issue of
                                timing of peace in relation to withdrawal, noting it is point in

                                    <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> explained that US
                                approach is based on assumption that timing question should be set

                                used occasion to strongly emphasize his earlier point that these
                                additional US formulations do not constitute a US document.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that
                                although reference to map now deleted from penultimate point, US had
                                retained it in new boundary language. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                    >Sisco</persName> said that reference to map in boundary
                                provision is correct concept and should offer no substantive
                                problem. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> recalled,
                                as he read again through revised formulations received at this and
                                preceding two sessions, that he had requested US clarification of
                                term “interference” in Suez Canal provision. <persName

                                remarked that joint paper which <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                    >Sisco</persName> proposing seems rather different from what
                                Soviets had in mind during New York talks. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had sought US
                                clarifications and had said it difficult meanwhile to come to

                                    >Dobrynin</persName> added that we would now have rather short
                                joint document which would leave <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300"

                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>. A basic judgment would
                                have to be made, and Soviets might decide it wiser to try to clarify

                                said Soviets since opening of New York talks had given no texts to
                                their Arab friends, although <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> gave oral briefings in New York. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> recalled there had been
                                misunderstanding in this respect after his July talks in Moscow
                                which we wanted to avoid this time. After July talks US was roundly
                                criticized by Arab friends for holding off consultations re US

                                situation vis-à-vis UAR caused by this misunderstanding had made

                            <item>Newest formulations were an attempt to reflect a common US-Soviet
                                approach, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> continued. As
                                for US gown position, we stand on our July document. As <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> had already noted, we have
                                not discussed formulations with Israelis. Before we can put
                                proposals to Israel for consideration, we must have answer to
                                question which Israelis will immediately ask: Does <gloss

                                our trying to press this or that provision in Tel Aviv, Amman, or
                                Cairo unless we know this reflects common approach. US and Soviets
                                owe it to each other to know how other power intends to proceed with
                                parties before other power proceeds.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> added that US needs
                                very specific indication from Soviets, as we have passed beyond
                                point of fencing with each other, and as US not prepared to alter
                                latest formulations in any substantial way. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> hoped Soviets would do us the
                                courtesy of informing us ahead of time if Moscow decides to discuss
                                formulations with Cairo. US had not decided whether to inform Arabs
                                and Israelis about new formulations. There were three possibilities
                                for Soviets, as for US: (a) to inform parties in general way, (b) to
                                discuss texts with parties, and (c) to give no information at all to
                                parties. Whatever course chosen, US and Soviets should avoid

                            properly: (1) the President wanted to point out the seriousness of the

                                >Dobrynin</persName> should not be confused by the various arguments
                            he had heard with respect to linkage—we considered linkage a fact and
                            not a policy, and foreign policy was made in the White House and nowhere
                            else; and (3) the President wanted to reiterate that we were in favor of

                            had taken it into account and that anything we did would not be directed
                            against the Soviet Union, they were the best judge of their own
                            interests and would have to decide what to do when the time came.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the second point, he said he had no illusions about the
                            linkage problem, and he saw not much point in repeating our well-known
                            position. I said I just wanted to make sure that he understood and was
                            not confused by the conflicting statements he read. I pointed to the <hi
                                rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> article, which had called attention to
                            these statements. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                                <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> had only repeated what the factual
                            situation was and had not made any editorial comments. I did not argue
                            the point, in the belief that propaganda was one thing and their
                            assessment of their policy was another.</p>

                        <p>With respect to the third point, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that his government was now beginning to
                            understand the seriousness with which we took the position we had
                            indicated, and had given up the illusion that they had held earlier in
                            the year that major progress was possible even while the Vietnam war was
                            going on. He added a little plaintively that he could not understand our
                            attitude because the Soviet Union was not making trouble for us in
                            Vietnam; they were not trying to embarrass us; but they could not get us
                            out of a war into which we had gotten ourselves. I said I thought our
                            position was clear, and there was no sense reiterating it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> told me that the NLF was
                            looking at our position from the point of view that any election would
                            be won by the government organizing it, and that we were trying to get
                            at the conference table what we had failed to get on the battlefield. I
                            said that we had specifically rejected such a proposition and that they
                            knew very well that we were prepared to discuss with them how to
                            organize the political process—they even knew how to do it.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> I had been
                            intrigued by a comment he had made the last time I had seen him; namely,
                            that Hanoi had found the conversation with me constructive. What was it
                            that they had considered constructive in that conversation? <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that they found my
                            attitude and my personality constructive—not the specific proposals
                            which they thought repeated well-known themes.</p>
                        <p>The meeting ended with an understanding that we would meet again in about
                            two weeks, the initiative to be left with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                        <p>On November 10, 1969, at 3:15 p.m., the National Security Council met to
                            discuss the upcoming preliminary round of strategic arms limitations
                            talks, which opened in Helsinki on November 17. The minutes of the

                        <p>After the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, President

                                <p>“The United States is prepared to discuss (a) limitations on all

                                    Soviets may advance for the work program. The Delegation should
                                    make it clear that in accepting subjects for further discussion
                                    the United States is not thereby committed to the inclusion of
                                    any given measure of limitation in a final agreement either
                                    individually or in combination with others. The President will
                                    make the judgment on what limitations are acceptable, and he
                                    will do so in light of the criteria for strategic sufficiency

                            incentive to strike the United States first in a crisis; 3) maintain the
                            capability to deny to the Soviet Union the ability to cause
                            significantly more deaths and industrial damage in the United States in
                            a nuclear war than they themselves would suffer; and 4) deploy defenses
                            which limit damage from small attacks or accidental launches to a low
                            level.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>

                        <p>“The U.S. would publicly emphasize its impartiality and noninvolvement,
                            urge both sides not to use nuclear weapons, call for negotiations and
                            the restoration of peace, and take steps to avoid any provocative
                            actions or accidental contact by US forces with belligerent forces. If
                            hostilities were set off by the Soviets, the US would express its strong
                            concern, and if nuclear weapons were used, strongly condemn their
                            employment. These points would be made privately as well to both the
                            Soviets and Chinese. We would not take the initiative to change our
                            bilateral negotiating posture toward the Soviets significantly in the
                            event of the conventional conflict, but if the Soviets employed nuclear
                            weapons, we would at least suspend arms limitation talks.</p>
                        <p>“In the event of any conventional Sino-Soviet conflict, the US military
                            readiness and reaction posture would be strengthened by selected command
                            and alerting actions. Scheduled overseas military exercises would be
                            reviewed for possible provocative risks and degradation of our military
                            posture, and force demobilization and withdrawal programs would be
                            selectively suspended pending further analysis of the impact of
                            Sino-Soviet hostilities on the US global force posture. In the event
                            nuclear weapons were employed, DEFCON status would be increased, <gloss

                        <p>“<gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 63 seems to proceed from certain
                            basic assumptions about the effect of the Sino-Soviet rivalry on US
                            interests. I would argue those assumptions. In my view, the revised
                            paper still: (a) overdraws the benefits of the dispute for the US, (b)
                            omits significant side effects of Sino-Soviet hostility, (c) fails to
                            probe the most likely form of a full-fledged Sino-Soviet war and (d)
                            puts the fundamental policy choice to the President in the wrong terms.”

                                            European countries. A number of wrong interpretations
                                            have been dropped which did not correspond to real

                                            Finland played positive role in this respect. Thus the

                                        <p>“Discussion of first question mentioned above could, it
                                            is believed, result in signing of final document that
                                            would proclaim principle of renunciation of use of force
                                            or threat of its use in mutual relations among states in
                                            Europe. Adoption of such document would acutally mean
                                            proclamation of principle of renunciation of war in
                                            Europe which is of special significance in view of fact
                                            that it is on the European continent that the two most
                                            powerful military-political groupings confront each
                                            other with their military forces concentrated there in
                                            immediate proximity of each other. Establishment on
                                            regional basis of principle to renounce use of force or
                                            threat of its use is in keeping with provisions of UN
                                            Charter and serves their further development. Besides it
                                            should be borne in mind that not all of states
                                            concerned—future participants in the all-European
                                            conference—are members of the UN. It goes without saying
                                            that adoption of document on non-use of force by
                                            all-European conference would by no means affect
                                            commitments assumed by states-participants in
                                            all-European conference through existing multilateral
                                            and bilateral treaties and agreements.</p>

                                            also result in adoption of appropriate document, would

                                            conference, as we see it, every state-participant will
                                            be given an opportunity to set forth its viewpoint on
                                            questions regarding the situation in Europe and means of

                                        <p>“Sometimes an opinion is voiced to effect that questions
                                            advanced by socialist countries are allegedly not of
                                            major scale and that cardinal problems such as German
                                            problem should be introduced at all-European conference.
                                            We do not agree with such statements at all. Suggestions
                                            to effect that German problem or other problems be
                                            included in the agenda—and such problems are understood
                                            by the West in a specific way which is clearly
                                            unacceptable to the socialist countries—would only serve
                                            to complicate if not downright torpedo convocation or,
                                            at any rate, fruitful work of the conference. One cannot

                                            should take the line that, as the Soviets themselves
                                            recognize, the real European issues are not amenable to
                                            solution by conference diplomacy and in any case involve
                                            only a specific number of states, not all of them. If
                                            the Europeans want a conference on the type of agenda
                                            the Soviets propose, let them have one, but without us.”

                        <p>While these projects differ in their approach to the Soviet target, they
                            share common objectives which provide the justification for continued
                            support of their activities. The primary objective is to stimulate and
                            sustain pressures for liberalization and change from within the Soviet
                            Union. The neuralgic points of this disaffection—desire for personal and
                            intellectual freedom, desire for improvement in the quality of life, and
                            the persistence of nationalism in Eastern Europe and among the
                            nationality groups in the Soviet Union—are the main issues exploited by
                            these projects. A secondary objective is to enlighten important
                            third-country elites, especially political leaders and the
                            public-opinion shaping professions, about the repressive nature of the
                            Soviet system and its imperialistic and self-aggrandizing foreign
                            policy.</p>

                        <p>Anticipating the persistence of these trends in the intellectual climate
                            of the Soviet Union in the 1970's, there is long-range merit in
                            continuing to encourage and support the publication and distribution of
                            dissident literature and socio-political commentary on the broad current
                            issues and the conditions of life in the Soviet Union, even though the
                            regime will continue to repress dissidence. Operations aimed at
                            influencing third-country elites are based on the assumption that
                            U.S.-Soviet competition for prestige and influence in strategic areas
                            will continue for an indefinite period of time. It would, therefore,
                            seem prudent to maintain a capability of influencing third-country
                            intellectuals and elite groups through the words and voices of
                            distinguished Soviet nationals who are disaffected.</p>
                        <p>The intellectual dissidence movement has demonstrated a vitality of its
                            own. It is reasonable to assume that these dissidents will continue to
                            seek outlets for literature and socio-political commentary that has thus
                            far been suppressed. Each time the regime has silenced a group of
                            dissidents a new group has emerged to produce a new generation of
                            protest literature.</p>
                        <p>An American professor [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] reported that the dissidence is widespread among
                            the Soviet intelligentsia and they “yearn for exposure to Western
                            literature and cultural influence.” Graphic evidence of the existence of
                            this dissidence was provided in October 1969 by Dr. <persName>Pyotr L.
                                Kapitsa</persName>, the “dean” of Soviet physicists, when he
                            publicly endorsed in Washington the thesis of Dr. <persName>Andre D.
                                Sakharov</persName>, a distinguished Soviet physicist credited with
                            a major role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, that the United
                            States and the Soviet Union can avoid a clash only through the
                            convergence of their systems of government. The Sakharov thesis is set
                            forth in a lengthy essay which has been circulating underground in the
                            Soviet Union and which has been a staple of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"

                                more vigorous emigration probably would strengthen the forces of
                                conformity and repression would retard the process of evolution in
                                popular and leadership attitudes which the program is trying to
                                promote.</item>

                            <item>It could also be argued that it would be in the national interest
                                to divorce the United States Government entirely from the emigration
                                and its activities. In this event the efforts of Soviet
                                conservatives to justify repression of dissent on the basis of
                                American “subversion” would lose some of their credibility. This
                                argument, however, is negated by the fact that suspicions of U.S.
                                intentions are so deeply ingrained that any change in U.S. policy
                                toward the emigration would have minimal impact on the
                                conservatives. Moreover, a source of support for those in the Soviet
                                Union who are sustained by a sense of contact with the emigration
                                would be removed and the Soviet authorities would be able more
                                easily to foist their own version of events on the people and be
                                under less pressure to make reforms.</item>

                        <p>On December 9, 1969, in a public address before the 1969 Galaxy
                            Conference on Adult Education in Washington, D.C., Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName> outlined a
                            proposal for an Arab-Israeli peace settlement. The position set forth in
                            the Secretary's speech, which became known as the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> Plan, incorporated most of the
                            language contained in the United States proposal handed to Soviet

                            Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs

                            1969 (see <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref>). <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> enunciated the main elements of
                            his plan as follows:</p>
                        <p>“Peace between the Parties</p>
                        <p>“—The Resolution of the Security Council makes clear that the goal is the
                            establishment of a state of peace between the parties instead of the
                            state of belligerency which has characterized relations for over 20
                            years. We believe the conditions and obligations of peace must be
                            defined in specific terms. For example, navigation rights in the Suez
                            Canal and in the Straits of Tiran should be spelled out. Respect for
                            sovereignty and obligations of the parties to each other must be made
                            specific.</p>
                        <p>“But peace, of course, involves much more than this. It is also a matter
                            of the attitudes and intentions of the parties. Are they ready to
                            coexist with one another? Can a live-and-let-live attitude replace
                            suspicion, mistrust and hate? A peace agreement between the parties must
                            be based on clear and stated intentions and a willingness to bring about
                            basic changes in the attitudes and conditions which are characteristic
                            of the Middle East today.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>“—A lasting peace must be sustained by a sense of security on both sides.
                            To this end, as envisaged in the Security Council resolution, there
                            should be demilitarized zones and related security arrangements more
                            reliable than those which existed in the area in the past. The parties
                            themselves, with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s help, are in the best position to work out the
                            nature and the details of such security arrangements. It is, after all,
                            their interests which are at stake and their territory which is
                            involved. They must live with the results.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>“—The Security Council Resolution endorses the principle of the
                            non-acquisition of territory by war and calls for withdrawal of Israeli
                            armed forces from territories occupied in the 1967 war. We support this
                            part of the Resolution, including withdrawal, just as we do its other
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>“The boundaries from which the 1967 war began were established in the
                            1949 Armistice Agreements and have defined the areas of national
                            jurisdiction in the Middle East for 20 years. Those boundaries were
                            armistice lines, not final political borders. The rights, claims and
                            positions of the parties in an ultimate peaceful settlement were
                            reserved by the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>“The Security Council Resolution neither endorses nor precludes these
                            armistice lines as the definitive political boundaries. However, it
                            calls for withdrawal from occupied territories, the non-acquisition of
                            territory by war, and for the establishment of secure and recognized
                            boundaries.</p>
                        <p>“We believe that while recognized political boundaries must be
                            established, and agreed upon by the parties, any changes in the
                            preexisting lines should not reflect the weight of conquest and should
                            be confined to insubstantial alterations required for mutual security.
                            We do not support expansionism. We believe troops must be withdrawn as
                            the Resolution provides. We support Israel's security and the security
                            of the Arab states as well. We are for a lasting peace that requires
                            security for both.”</p>

                        <p>On December 10, 1969, Israel rejected <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName>' proposals. At 10 a.m., the National Security
                            Council met to discuss the situation in the Middle East. When discussion
                            turned to the best forum to continue negotiations, the President's
                            Assistant for National Security Affairs <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Henry Kissinger</persName> made the following comments about
                            bilateral talks between the Soviet Union and the United States:</p>
                        <p>“US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> talks have been confined to the
                            UAR because the issues seemed more tractable, because a UAR settlement
                            would facilitate a Jordan settlement and because we thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might press the UAR. Those who argued
                            for entering those talks did so on three grounds. First, for global
                            reasons, the US had an interest in seeing whether it could negotiate
                            seriously on a range of important issues. Second, the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s persistent requests since September
                            1968 to talk about a Mid-East settlement suggested that Moscow might be
                            uncomfortable in the Mid-East and might participate seriously in trying
                            to work out a reasonable arrangement. While we maintained a proper
                            skepticism, it made sense to probe far enough to see what was possible.
                            Third, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should pay at least as
                            much of the price for a settlement as the U.S. in expanding its
                            influence with its clients. Those who opposed this course argued mainly
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not want a real
                            peace; it simply wanted to persuade us to press Israel to give back <pb
                                n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0350"/>the territory of Moscow's
                            clients. Since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not likely
                            to act seriously, it did not make sense to formalize the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s role in the Mid-East by giving it a
                            place at the peace table.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard Nixon</persName> then
                            commented:</p>
                        <p>“It has been one of our assumptions in the U.S.-Soviet talks that we
                            could get the Soviet Union to help bring the UAR around. Mr.
                                <persName>[John] McCloy</persName> yesterday hit hard on the
                            following point: <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> tells him
                            and other American businessmen that the Egyptians don't want to be
                            exclusively in Soviet clutches. They would like the opportunity for
                            direct communication with the U.S. The oil people all seem to feel that
                            we are making a mistake not to have a direct channel of communications
                            with the Egyptians.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> remarked as follows:</p>
                        <p>“We do have direct channels of communication with the Egyptians. It is
                            interesting to note that when I sent my letter [outlining the <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> plan] to [UAR] Foreign Minister
                            [Mahmoud] <persName corresp="#p_RM8">Riad</persName>, [Soviet]
                            Ambassador [Anatoly] <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            came in and told me that [Soviet] Foreign Minister [Andrei] <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had been embarrassed by what I
                            had said in my letter. <persName corresp="#p_RM8">Riad</persName> had
                            turned over a copy of my letter to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName>. Here was an opportunity given to the Egyptians
                            to communicate with the U.S. and not to involve the Russians, and the
                            first thing they did was to turn over the communication to the
                            Russians.”</p>
                        <p>After further discussion about Middle East issues not directly related to
                            the Soviet Union, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            remarked:</p>
                        <p>“On the Middle East, however, it is fair to say that Soviet interests can
                            only be served by tension. I know it is sometimes said that the Soviets
                            are uncomfortable in the present situation. But I sometimes have trouble
                            understanding why.”</p>
                        <p>The following exchanges then took place:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: I think they want the
                            situation to stay the way it is.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>: I am not so
                            sure of that. I believe they are quite concerned about the consequences
                            of the kind of explosion Israel could provoke.</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The longer Israel
                            holds its conquered Arab territory, the longer the Soviets cannot
                            deliver what the Arabs want. As that time drags on, the Arabs must begin
                            to conclude that friendship with the Soviet Union is not very
                            helpful—that it led to two defeats, one of which the U.S. rescued the
                            Arabs from, and to continued impotence in regaining what they have
                            lost.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>: The Soviets
                            have some of the same problems with the UAR that we have with Israel.
                            They cannot just walk in to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s office and gain his acceptance of any
                            proposition they may put to him. They must consider the fact that the
                            more radical Arab <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0351"/>elements like
                            the fedayeen are going to blame the Soviets for not producing what the
                            Arabs want.</p>
                        <p>“President: Then it is possible to argue, is it not, that if we want the
                            Soviets to help, Israel is producing that result by scaring them. Why
                            should it not be our policy to let Israel scare them a little bit
                            more?</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>: I think our
                            position is pretty well spelled out now as a result of my speech last
                            night. The position I elaborated on there is thoroughly consistent with
                            the UN Security Council resolution.” (National Archives, <persName

                        <p>I notice that <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Gerard Smith</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> proposed
                            that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> be informed of the
                            resumption of US-Chinese talks before it becomes public knowledge.</p>
                        <p>In the last Administration it was a standard practice for the State
                            Department to provide <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            with detailed records of the Warsaw talks. This was done at the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> and Bohlen level.
                            The idea was to calm possible Soviet suspicions. It was also assumed
                            that the Russians probably had some knowledge of the content of the
                            talks from Polish monitoring operations and that, therefore, there was
                            no harm in providing them with the full record.</p>
                        <p>I believe that as a matter of style, and consistent with our general
                            approach to the Soviets and the Chinese Communists, this practice of the
                            last Administration should not be resumed in this one.<note n="2"

                            in the early post World War II years, at a time when fear of eventual if
                            not imminent war with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was very
                            real in the West. Emigré organizations and individual Soviet refugees
                            were in demand to help staff proliferating anti-Soviet activities and
                            serve generally as a reserve for a possible war emergency.</p>
                        <p>After the 1950's, the United States became more selective in its support
                            for émigré activities. It had become clear that the émigrés were
                            hopelessly split between groups with opposing aims, philosophies and
                            ethnic composition and that it was difficult for any government working
                            closely with them not to be dragged into the morass of émigré politics.
                            In the mid-1950's, efforts were, in fact, abandoned to try to unite the
                            anti-Soviet émigrés behind a common program. The declining interest in
                            émigrés was also related to the realization that they were aging and had
                            grown increasingly out of touch with developments in the <pb n="322"
                                xml:id="pg_322" facs="0355"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The relations between the United
                            States Government and the émigré community also became more distant as
                            the United States and the Soviet Union moved toward a more normal
                            relationship.</p>
                        <p>In the early 1960's, the more responsible émigré leaders came to realize
                            that there was no hope of returning to their homeland in the wake of a
                            Soviet-American war or after the overthrow of the Soviet regime. They
                            therefore shifted the emphasis of their activities toward stimulating
                            and publicizing the growing intellectual ferment and expressions of
                            dissidence within the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>United States officials had come to understand that assistance to the
                            émigrés for the eventuality of war with or revolution within the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was unrealistic. The skills of the
                            émigrés would be available in the event of war, regardless of whether or
                            not the United States was subsidizing émigré organizations. The sort of
                            mass unrest and revolutionary changes predicted by some émigrés were
                            unlikely to occur within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> under
                            conditions short of war. To the extent that significant changes in
                            Soviet policy or leadership might take place, they were likely to result
                            from the actions of a relatively narrow circle of leaders responding to
                            changing attitudes and imperatives within Soviet soviety.</p>
                        <p>It was recognized, at the same time, that the émigrés could play an
                            important role in overcoming the resistance to change in Soviet society
                            by stimulating dissatisfaction with existing policy among the Soviet
                            people, especially under the less repressive conditions which followed
                            Stalin's death. As broadcasters, editors and scholars working for Radio
                            Liberty and other émigré information activities, the émigrés were able
                            to address themselves more candidly than U.S. officials could to
                            developments within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; and there
                            was evidence that the émigrés reached an important audience in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> precisely because they spoke
                            with special intimacy and concern about developments in Mother Russia.
                            In short, the United States Government concluded that anti-Soviet
                            émigrés had a special contribution to make to United States information
                            programs, both overt and covert, which collectively aimed at influencing
                            the attitudes of the Soviet people and their leaders in directions which
                            would make the Soviet Government a more constructive and responsible
                            member of the world community.</p>
                        <p>It was also recognized that the émigrés had a certain role to play per
                            se. For some Soviet intellectuals and liberals, they served as in the
                            19th century as the “conscience-in-exile” and repository of the best
                            cultural traditions of the Russian people and in extremis as a haven of
                            refuge. The émigré organizations accordingly provided—and continue to
                            provide—encouragement to intellectuals in their struggle for personal
                            freedom against the Soviet regime.</p>
                        <p>Emigré groups have continued to seek official American recognition and
                            support for their particular organizations and aims. In their response,
                            American officials have been authorized to express traditional <pb
                                n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0356"/>American sympathy for all
                            peoples struggling to preserve their cultural traditions and religious
                            beliefs and to protect the human rights of their people. At the same
                            time, it has long been United States Government policy to remain neutral
                            between the Russian proponents of a unitary Russia and émigrés from
                            national minority areas favoring separatist policies.</p>

                        <p>I thought you might be interested in a speculative piece I asked to be
                            prepared on some aspects of Soviet policy.</p>
                        <p>The main points are: The Soviets have several balls in the air—<gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, the talks with China, and the new
                            negotiations in Bonn; while it is tempting to see a grand design behind
                            their diverse moves, one suspects there is a large element of
                            improvisation.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Soviet negotiators have been rather reserved, avoiding some key
                            issues, and generally leaving the first moves up to us; by insisting on
                            national means of verification, however, they have sharply narrowed the
                            range of realistic proposals. One of their main incentives is their
                            evident concern over Safeguard. They may hope to generate a new debate
                            in this country by proposing a complete ban. At the same time, they have
                            hinted at an interest in a fairly simple agreement early in the next
                            phase.</p>

                        <p>Some observers see a close connection between <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss> and the Sino-Soviet talks. While the Soviet position
                            at Helsinki has been perfectly understandable in terms of the issues,
                            they have tried to impress Peking with the possibilities of a
                            Soviet-American rapprochement at Chinese expense. The Chinese have
                            countered by reopening the Warsaw channel.</p>
                        <p>As for the talks in Peking, it does not appear that the interruption last
                            week means a breakdown or new crisis. Both sides apparently see a
                            tactical advantage to continuing the discussions. But the negotiations

                                prepared to go. We believe that two documents provide framework
                                within which parties can and should begin negotiations. Four Powers
                                should get parties to negotiate on basis Rhodes formula, otherwise

                                knew that Soviet side had no specific objection to Rhodes formula.
                                Nevertheless in view of comments made by various parties regarding
                                formula, Soviet side now felt Rhodes formula should not be used.
                                Soviets feel Rhodes formula would not help very much in present
                                state of affairs. Although Moscow is doubtful about any specific use
                                of this formula, it is prepared to find something similar.</item>

                                neutral language on some questions, but reiterated that Soviet view
                                is that more precise language should be found on such questions as

                                of negotiations. After the negotiations get underway, Four Powers
                                could help in making suggestions and in encouraging parties directly
                                concerned to reach agreement. We cannot overemphasize importance we
                                attach to getting parties to negotiate.</item>

                                started would be for Four Powers to agree on our two documents since
                                they represent a sound framework for negotiations and are totally
                                consistent with the Security Council Resolution. Secretary said we
                                must get parties directly concerned negotiating and thereafter Four
                                Powers could help prod the parties from behind the scenes while

                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said that United States
                                feels Rhodes formula is neutral. It makes possible all sorts of
                                diplomatic contacts, direct and indirect. It, therefore, meets main
                                requirements of situation. Soviet change on Rhodes formula is a
                                retrogressive step. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                    >Rogers</persName> recalled that <persName corresp="#p_RM8"
                                    >Riad</persName> had himself raised question of the Rhodes
                                formula during discussions in New York and had accepted it.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> suggested that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RM8">Riad</persName> had accepted the
                                formula on condition that any talks would be indirect. Secretary
                                said let them call it indirect if they wish. We see no problem on
                                that score. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                                that basic Soviet position is that an attempt should now be made to
                                go beyond neutral formulations where possible in an attempt to find
                                more precise language on elements of settlement. After this is done
                                a formula providing for use of <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> might be found to bring about negotiations.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether it
                                is the United States position to give <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> papers and to let him proceed from there in
                                an effort to start negotiations. If this were the United States
                                position, he doubted whether <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> could be successful.</item>

                            <item>The Secretary noted that if the parties accepted Rhodes formula,
                                they could interpret it as they desired. He reiterated that the <pb
                                    n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0364"/>United States firmly
                                believed that a settlement could not be imposed. We do not believe

                                basis. Once parties agreed to negotiate with the United States
                                papers as a framework, Four Powers could provide guidance and
                                encouragement subsequently on specific points not covered by these
                                documents.</item>

                                    >Jarring</persName> all three papers, that is, the United

                                Jordan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said
                                that we continue to believe US papers offer best basis for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> to proceed—they contain

                                papers that have been presented on Jordan, in our view, do not

                                hesitate to say that the United States paper on Jordan, for example,
                                should be the central document. He assumed that any paper on Jordan
                                would be of a joint nature.</item>

                            <item>Secretary said that we had hoped that our October 28 proposal
                                would represent a joint US-Soviet paper since it took Soviet views
                                into account. US does not want to consider October 28 proposal and
                                our paper on Jordan as beginning points for negotiation among the
                                Four Powers. We feel that we have gone as far as we can. We believe
                                US papers provide <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>
                                with what he needs; they are a fair and equitable framework for

                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said we will obviously
                                study Soviet document carefully in an attempt to arrive at a
                                conclusion as to whether it makes any sense to proceed any further
                                in bilateral and Four Power talks. Principal focus in the Four Power
                                discussions is, of course, Jordan. Depending upon the reaction to
                                our paper on this subject, we will also wish to make a judgment
                                regarding whether further discussions in Four Power context are
                                useful. Soviet statement which we received today seems a reflection
                                of its position back in June;<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">See <ref

                                also asked whether the Arab countries are interested in a process of
                                negotiation or whether they are simply interested in getting
                                Israelis to withdraw and only afterward to begin negotiation
                                process.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again refused to
                                answer directly. He said this question was too broad and that there
                                was no simple answer. He noted, however, that there has been some
                                transformation in Arab thinking. For example, in past some Arab
                                leaders had no desire to recognize existence of Israel.
                                Subsequently, Arab leaders have indicated that they have changed
                                their position on this score. With respect to Israelis, one
                                difficult question was how to handle Fedayeen problem. This was
                                difficult issue to articulate on paper. This appears to be question
                                which could be handled satisfactorily. Soviet Union and US appear to
                                be very close with respect to refugee problem. At same time
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he did not
                                understand US reluctance to mention the UN Resolution on refugees.
                                Nevertheless, some agreement could be reached on that issue.
                                Furthermore, Egyptians seemed willing to accept some formulation
                                regarding the Strait of Tiran. Question of providing guarantees is a
                                more difficult one. Soviet Union believes that guarantees could be
                                provided by Security Council, where US and Soviet Union have veto
                                power. UN troops under control of Security Council might, for
                                example, be stationed at Sharm al-Shaykh. The Soviet Union cannot,
                                however, accept the stationing of Israeli troops there as the US
                                evidently has proposed.</item>

                                al-Shaykh. Soviets had conveyed this impression to Arabs, and we
                                have spent some weeks correcting this interpretation. In <persName

                                he came up with idea of neutral formulations prejudicing neither

                                    Vietnam with a very low-key tone. His threat about what would
                                    happen if we started bombing the North again or hit
                                    Haiphong—that the Chinese would send in engineer battalions
                                    which would increase Chinese influence in Hanoi—seems almost to
                                    be an invitation for us to attack North Vietnam.</item>
                                <item>—<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he
                                    did not think Hanoi would have anything new to say for the next

                                <item>—The Russians seem eager to talk on a number of substantive
                                    issues. They are probably trying to head us towards a summit
                                    meeting. This could be a reflection of a desire for real
                                    détente, or it could mean they are getting ready to hit China in
                                    the Spring. The latter interpretation—that they are repeating
                                    their Czechoslovakia drill—is reinforced by their choosing April
                                    16 as a date for resumption of the <gloss target="#t_SALT1"

                            could decide after the discussion of each topic was completed and after

                                    >Dobrynin</persName> opened the conversation by saying that he
                                wanted to speak to me on a frank and open basis. He had missed the
                                opportunity to talk to me for a long time, and he hoped that our
                                meetings would be more frequent. I said that it was always a
                                pleasure to talk to him.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that when he

                                        target="#d93">Document 93</ref>.</note> the President had
                                indicated that the Middle East and other issues could be settled
                                only on the highest level. With this, the Soviet Government agreed.
                                On the other hand, the President had also indicated that there could
                                be no contact on any level except the diplomatic level until Vietnam
                                was settled. Did this mean that we did not believe that there could
                                be any progress in our relations with the Soviet Union? I asked
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> why he raised
                                this issue now, since I thought we had explained to him at great
                                length what our position was and that nothing had really changed.
                                Vietnam was an important problem to us, and he knew how we related
                                it to other issues.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he wanted to be
                                frank. He had made a careful analysis of the American domestic
                                situation, and he had communicated it to Moscow as follows:</p>
                            <p>The President was almost certain of re-election in 1972. He had only
                                begun to tap the right-wing votes and he could always expand his
                                base in that direction. There was, therefore, no prospect of
                                anyone's unseating him in 1972. If anyone wanted to wait him out,
                                they had to be ready to wait for seven more years. This was too long
                                for the Soviet Union, and it should also be too long for Hanoi. He
                                therefore wanted to ask me again whether I saw any prospect for
                                improving Soviet/American relations.</p>
                            <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0368"/>
                            <p>I repeated the President's statement at the October 20th meeting that
                                he hoped to have his Administration go down in history as one that
                                did bring about a substantial improvement in Soviet/American
                                relations but we wanted to proceed by concrete steps. And, of
                                course, it was a difficult problem while the Vietnam war went
                                on.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">
                                <hi rend="italic">Vietnam</hi>

                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the
                                war in Vietnam. He said, “You have to understand that we tried to do
                                something last April and May, but Hanoi told us that there was no
                                sense having a private channel unless the United States agreed in
                                advance to negotiate about a coalition government. We cannot tell
                                them how to fight in their own country. This is a real problem to
                                us, and we thought it was best not to return a negative reply.” I
                                said it would have been better to return some sort of a reply, but
                                there was no sense talking about the past.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me how I
                                saw the future. I said that I really had not come to discuss
                                Vietnam, but to sum it up in a few words, we were very confident.
                                For the first time in my experience with Vietnam, I now was certain
                                that time was working on our side. It seemed to me that Hanoi had
                                only two choices—to negotiate or to see its structure in South
                                Vietnam erode. He said, “Isn't there even a slight chance that the
                                South Vietnam Government might collapse?” I said that we were
                                confident that we were on the right course. Maybe Hanoi would start
                                an offensive but then, as the President had repeatedly pointed out
                                publicly, it would have to draw the consequences. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said, “Of course, if you
                                start bombing the North again, or if you hit Haiphong, you realize
                                what would happen.” I expected him to say the Soviet Union would
                                come in. But instead, he said, “What would happen is the Chinese
                                would send in engineer battalions, and you don't want to increase
                                Chinese influence in Hanoi.” I said, “If you can live with it, we
                                can,” and in any event, our problem was to end the war in South
                                Vietnam.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he did not
                                think that Hanoi had anything new to say for the next few months. I
                                told him that they knew what channels were available and that we
                                would be glad to listen to them if they did. We would be flexible
                                and conciliatory in negotiations. We had no intention to humiliate
                                Hanoi, but we would not pay an additional price to enter the
                                negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked
                                me whether we were ever going to send a senior Ambassador to the
                                negotiations. I said it depended in part on the negotiations, but I
                                had no doubt that ultimately it would be done. He said he had to
                                admit that nothing was going on at the negotiations now, but that he
                                thought they were an important symbol.</p>
                            <p>I said in conclusion that if Hanoi had something to say to us it
                                should do so explicitly, and not get us involved in detective
                                stories in <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0369"/>which various
                                self-appointed or second-level emissaries were dropping oblique

                                said he would be sure to get this point across. He thought Hanoi had

                            <p>The major point about the Vietnam part was the complete absence of

                                part. There was no challenge to my assertion that our policy was
                                working out, and there was a conspicuous effort by <persName

                                groupings, etc. I asked him how the Russians saw their own interests
                                in the area. Surprisingly, he said, “We don't have real interests
                                there. We were drawn in in 1964 on the basis of a
                                    misunderstanding.”<note n="6" xml:id="d110fn6">

                                issues. He began with a familiar catalogue. He said that the Soviet
                                Government was approaching relations with the United States with an
                                open mind and with good will, but a number of very strange things
                                had happened. They had made a formal proposal to Secretary <persName

                            <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we
                                remained interested in good relations with the Soviet Union. We were
                                the two great powers, and we had to avoid conflict; we should speak
                                while we were still in a position to make definitive decisions. At
                                the same time, as the President had repeatedly pointed out, we
                                wanted to have concrete, detailed negotiations. Until he told me
                                just what he was aiming at, it was very hard for me to comment on
                                his points, since I did not know what he understood by progress. For
                                example, we had heard a great deal about the European Security
                                Conference, but I did not know just exactly what the Soviet Union
                                hoped to achieve there. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName> said, “Well, why don't you ask us. We would
                                be glad to tell you at any level.” I said, “Well, maybe we should
                                ask you, but why don't you tell me now.” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName> said, “We want existing frontiers
                                recognized.” I said, “No one is challenging the existing frontiers.”
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had
                                the impression we were challenging the status quo in Germany. I told
                                him we were not challenging the status quo in Germany, but there was
                                a big difference between challenging it and giving juridical
                                recognition to East Germany.</p>
                            <p>
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked about
                                China. He said, “What exactly are you up to. Are you trying to annoy
                                the Soviet Union?” He also asked how we visualized relations with
                                China developing. I said the President had often pointed out that
                                the 800,000,000 Chinese were a fact of international life which we
                                had to take seriously and from which we couldn't foreclose
                                ourselves. We were not childish, and we did not believe that we
                                could end all the distrust immediately or have a very huge
                                negotiation immediately. But we did want to establish some sort of
                                relationship. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said,
                                “How can you do it as long as you have Taiwan?” I told him that this
                                was essentially our problem, and that we thought we could explore
                                possibilities. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said,
                                “Well, you made <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0371"/>a rather
                                clever move getting Japan involved in the defense of Taiwan and at

                                this. I said we had no intention of playing for small stakes with
                                Communist China, and needling the Soviet Union was an unhistoric and
                                not worthwhile effort. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName> asked why we don't recognize Mongolia. He
                                said that the Soviet Union would welcome it.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that he

                                not take into account the power realities. He thought that the

                                other countries could attempt to maneuver between us. For example,
                                the British were always going to the Soviet Union and telling them
                                that the United States was preventing a European Security
                                Conference, but the Soviet Union knew the British game.<note n="14"

                                nothing. I said that I did not know to which statements he referred,
                                but that the British and we were in rather close accord.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I said to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> it
                                was not very fruitful to discuss these issues in the abstract. It
                                would be much better if we discussed them at least on a hypothetical

                                aware of the fact that the President might not wish to have
                                comprehensive solutions while the war in Vietnam was going on, but
                                they saw no harm in exploring what such solutions might look

                                each session for one particular topic. We could then decide after
                                the topic was completed and after this had been discussed with the

                                would be given or it should be taken to another level. I told him
                                that I would have to take this matter up with the President, but
                                that, in principle, it was possible that we might proceed this

                                other areas if we understand each other.” I told him that he could
                                be sure I would report this fully to the President, and that I would
                                be in touch with him after we returned from the West Coast.</p>

                                    of source text not declassified</hi>] asserted that in seeking a

                                with West Germany the Soviets are trying to create a “quiet Western
                                front” so as to be able to “deal with China in the East.” The
                                clincher [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                coming to final grips with the China problem, Moscow feels compelled
                                to reach an understanding with its sometime enemy/sometime partner
                                in counterrevolution, US imperialism.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, such verbal expressions of concern over Moscow's designs
                                against China are being reinforced by a “war preparations” campaign
                                that has been under way among the civilian population since the
                                beginning of the present border conflict last spring. According to a
                                series of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                    declassified</hi>] reports, the latest aspects of this drive are
                                the digging of trenches and underground personnel shelters, frequent
                                air raid drills in the cities, and the dispersal of a portion of the
                                urban population. This does not mean that Peking is anticipating an
                                imminent Soviet attack; fundamentally, much of what is billed as
                                “war preparations” is designed to promote national unity and
                                unpopular domestic programs. Nevertheless, such highly visible civil
                                defense exercises also demonstrate to Moscow that China is prepared
                                to resist Soviet pressure and is maintaining at least a minimum
                                level of readiness against an attack. According to a recent [<hi

                                that “if we did not prepare, the Soviets would certainly

                                    December.</note> this much seems clear: they are not likely to
                                alter significantly the present realities of the Sino-Soviet dispute
                                or in any way diminish the ideological and political gulf separating
                                the two sides. Moscow, painfully convinced of a long-term menace
                                posed by a Maoist China and encouraged by its success in
                                intimidating Peking, can be expected to maintain a hard line in
                                dealing with the Chinese. Even if the border remains calm the
                                Soviets will almost certainly see fit to continue and perhaps
                                increase their massive military superiority along the frontier—a
                                very real form of military pressure. By the same token, Moscow
                                appears committed to its diplomatic policy of “containment” and is
                                not likely to back away from its efforts to isolate China within and
                                without the Communist world.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to overemphasize the impact of this Soviet policy on
                                China's future domestic and international course. Peking will of
                                necessity remain the vulnerable and defensive party in the dispute
                                and the formulation of future Chinese policy may be increasingly
                                influenced by the shadow of Soviet hostility. On the domestic front,
                                such questions as proper military tactics and planning to cope with
                                the Soviet threat will almost certainly become contentious issues as
                                Peking continues its efforts to construct a new domestic order out
                                of the political wreckage of the Cultural Revolution. In terms of
                                Chinese diplomacy the effects of this new Sino-Soviet equation have
                                already surfaced. The recent attempt by Peking to repair its ties
                                with North Korea, North Vietnam and Yugoslavia were doubtless
                                encouraged by China's growing awareness of its weak international
                                position vis-à-vis Moscow. The future course of Chinese foreign
                                policy will probably be increasingly motivated by Peking's desire to
                                do what it can to correct this diplomatic imbalance. The fact that
                                Chinese diplomats in Warsaw have just received the US Ambassador for
                                exploratory talks is further evidence of this state of mind.</p>

                        <p>As you requested, I saw <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoliy
                                Dobrynin</persName> to tell him that you approved in principle his
                            suggestion that we meet regularly to discuss specific topics. When I
                            called <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to tell him that
                            I wanted to see him, he expressed some concern that there might be some
                            connection between my call and the delay of your vacation trip. I did
                            not comment one way or the other except to say that my call was in
                            connection with our dinner conversation.<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">See
                                Tab A, <ref target="#d110">Document 110</ref>.</note> He said he
                            hoped that I understood that the dinner conversation was merely a frank
                            expression of his personal views.</p>
                        <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at 11:30 a.m. on
                            December 29th with the intention of spending only a very brief time with
                            him. Instead, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stayed for
                            nearly an hour. I began the conversation by saying that the President
                            had carefully reviewed the memorandum of our conversation the previous
                                week<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">Ibid.</note> and has asked that I
                            see the Ambassador before our trip to the West Coast<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d112fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> planned to spend
                                the New Year holiday with President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName> at his vacation home in San Clemente on the
                                southern California coast.</note> and to tell him that we saw some
                            merit in the idea of private conversations between the Ambassador and
                            me. I pointed out that the Soviet Government knew our view on Vietnam
                            and the impact it had on other negotiations but stated that nevertheless
                            there might be some merit in exploring what a détente might look like
                            were the political conditions right to achieve it. Both sides had been
                            saying for months now that they wanted to improve relations but this
                            general formulation up to now has lacked specificity. The procedure the
                            Ambassador had outlined seemed sensible, namely that we would set aside
                            each meeting for one particular topic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had been
                            told by Moscow that on matters of high policy he should deal primarily
                            with me, while routine matters <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0376"
                            />should be handled at the State Department. I replied that the
                            President had asked me to tell him that we would assume that if matters
                            of great importance came up they would be discussed in this channel, and
                            that we would ignore secondary overtures. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> stated there would be no secondary
                            overtures.</p>
                        <p>We then discussed what subjects might be included and the order in which
                            to take them up. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            suggested European security and the Middle East. I said that there might
                            be some merit in discussing <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>—not
                            from the point of view of technical solutions but simply to see what
                            sort of an arrangement was generally conceivable, whether, for example,
                            it should be limited or comprehensive. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> thought about this for a minute and then said
                            that perhaps we should put <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> very
                            high on our agenda. Moscow would undoubtedly be making decisions on how
                            to proceed with <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> during February
                            and March and it might be helpful if we could get our general thinking
                            in harmony. The details could then be worked out by the negotiators.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that their internal approach was entirely different from ours. We had
                            experts strictly on disarmament, while they did not. When <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was present as Soviet <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> proposals were discussed, the Soviet
                            group was composed of technical experts from the various ministries,
                            including financial experts who were responsible for commenting on the
                            budgetary implications of various proposals. But there was no single
                            group in the Soviet Union which had a vested interest in disarmament as
                            such. Their military men were expected to be able to handle the broad
                            general view.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed that the
                            President's comment that we expected to be serious and not engage in
                            propaganda had certainly helped the Soviet's preparations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the
                            Middle East and said that in the present framework the negotiations were
                            stalemated. He wondered how I conceived the problem. I said there were
                            two categories of issues. One was the relation between Arabs and Israel.
                            These, I thought, could be settled only if both great powers were
                            willing to ask their friends to make sacrifices. There was no point in
                            insisting on unilateral concessions. The second range of issues which
                            had not yet even been touched upon was first, how the Soviet Union and
                            the United States could avoid being embroiled in a war that might break
                            out and second, how they could regulate their different interests in the
                            Middle East apart from the Arab-Israeli conflict. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the second range of
                            questions were of very great interest in Moscow. He did not contradict
                            my formulation of the first range of questions. He said that one remark
                            the President had made had struck home with particular force in Moscow,
                            namely, that “after all Israel had won the war.” If that meant that we
                            wanted to have Egypt bear the whole burden, then prospects for
                            negotiations <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0377"/>were dim indeed. I
                            said the President was not stating a condition but a fact of life and
                            that he was not saying Egypt should bear the whole burden but should
                            keep in mind that it must bear <hi rend="italic">some</hi> burden.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that we might
                            not realize it but every word the President said was studied with
                            extraordinary care in Moscow. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> asked whether I wanted to discuss Vietnam as
                            part of our meetings and indicated that he would be prepared to do so. I
                            showed no particular eagerness but simply pointed out that we knew what
                            we were doing in Vietnam and that we hoped they would understand that
                            any measures we might be forced to take would not be directed against
                            them. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he was
                            watching our policy with great interest. I also said that I hoped that
                            the Soviets would make clear to their North Vietnamese allies that a
                            major offensive by them would have the gravest consequences. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made no comment.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of the conversation, I raised the possibility of a visit
                            by the astronauts to the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he wanted to be frank. The Soviet
                            people were very emotional and if the astronauts came they would
                            undoubtedly receive a tremendous reception. He did not know whether the
                            Soviet leaders considered conditions ripe for the sort of demonstration
                            that would follow.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that in the next
                            few days he would inquire at the State Department about our thinking
                            with respect to depositing the instrument of ratification of the
                            Non-Proliferation Treaty. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> had wanted to wait until enough states had
                            ratified to put the Treaty into effect. What if this was delayed for
                            several months? I said this was not an issue of high policy and that I
                            was certain there would be no undue delay.</p>
                        <p>We ended the meeting with an agreement that as soon as I return from
                            California we would arrange a schedule for our meetings.</p>

                        <p>Re your <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> conversation. I
                            take it you have already sent comments to the President so this may be
                            plugging the hole after the mouse has escaped.</p>
                        <p>You seem now to be on the foothills to the summit and yet the negotiable
                            concrete issues seem more elusive than ever. In Vietnam, the Soviets may
                            be genuinely concerned that we have a workable policy. If we do, there
                            is little or nothing to talk to them about; if we don't I see no more
                            prospect than before that talking to them is useful. On the Middle East,
                            we can't deliver our clients and they won't deliver theirs. In Europe,
                            they have nothing attractive to offer us except stabilizing Berlin and
                            that is probably too good a club for them to give up. Arms issues may or
                            may not hold promise, but anything that would really make a difference
                            is hardly in view.</p>
                        <p>So you get down to rhetoric and atmosphere. Maybe <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> wants those so he can attack
                            China next year. Maybe he wants them because it helps him in his own
                            power conflicts at home (it would not be the first time that tottering
                            Soviet leaders have enlisted an American President's help to prolong
                            their political lives). Maybe the Soviets have no clear idea at all;
                            perhaps, as <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> says, they
                            are reconciled to the President's staying in power for seven more years
                            anchored to a right-wing power base and they just want to keep talking
                            because silence frightens them.</p>
                        <p>In any case, the Soviets obviously want to talk to the White House and no
                            responsible American President can ignore that. I just hope we won't end
                            up playing <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s game on a
                            global scale.</p>

                            tried to do this by distinguishing between de facto (beginning of

                            withdrawal which would permit UAR troops to move into the Canal area as
                            soon as Israeli troops have withdrawn 30–40 kilometers.</p>

                        <p>What most strikes me after completing this review of the documents is the
                            cavalier nature of the December 23 Soviet reply. After actively
                            discussing a joint document between June 17—when they produced a draft
                            of their own—and September 30, they simply turned aside our October 28
                            formulation—containing the position they wanted from us on boundaries—as
                            providing no basis for a joint document.</p>
                        <p>This has taken place when—as a review of the above positions shows—we
                            might well reach agreement if they would take as much distance from the
                            UAR's position as we have from Israel's.</p>
                        <p>There seem theoretically to be two possible explanations: <list>
                                <item>—They are testing whether a flat rejection will cause us to
                                    make a few last concessions.</item>
                                <item>—They are sufficiently content with the present situation not
                                    to be willing to press until after the Arab summit,<note n="6"

                        <p>It may be that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s failure at

                            slightly increases our advantage. In any case, the December 23 response
                            is such a step backward that it warrants a sharp rebuff and even telling

                                        is that the Communists represent only small minority of

                        <p>Our dealings with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on European
                            issues, at least in recent years, are not strictly speaking analogous to
                            our talks with them on the Middle East or arms control questions. On
                            these latter matters we have had sustained negotiations either
                            culminating in an agreed document (arms control) or revolving around
                            such a document (Middle East). Since 1959, we have not really had this
                            type of negotiation on European matters.</p>
                        <p>Rather there have been a series of long-range artillery duels via public
                            declarations (usually, though not exclusively, issued by our respective
                            alliance groupings), interspersed with occasional, random and disjointed
                            bilateral conversations at various levels.</p>
                        <p>We have, by and large, been scrupulous in not making ourselves the
                            Western negotiating agent on Europe; even if we had wanted it otherwise,
                            it is not now likely that our allies would let us. If, on the other
                            hand, we wanted to begin dealing with the Soviets on European questions,
                            without the blessing of the allies, the effect on <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would almost certainly be chaotic. In
                            this connection, it is of interest that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> has now come forward with the suggestion to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> that there should
                            be bilateral US-Soviet talks on a European security conference.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s strongly
                            reiterated insistence on a direct US reply to the Soviet démarche of
                            November 19<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">See <ref target="#d102">Document
                                    102</ref>.</note> is undoubtedly also related to this.</p>
                        <p>Diplomacy in this area has also been complicated by numerous
                            side-shows—not unnaturally, since the interests of a great number of
                            states, East and West, are involved. A review of US and Soviet exchanges
                            therefore does not provide a complete picture—although it does provide
                            the essence. The present paper does not attempt to include the mass of
                            exchanges, public and private, among individual European states, nor our
                            own occasional exchanges, notably with the Poles and Romanians who,
                            while supporting Soviet and Warsaw Pact positions, do so for reasons and
                            with accents of their own.</p>
                        <p>It should also be noted that some US-Soviet negotiations while ostensibly
                            or mainly on matters other than regional European ones, have profound
                            impact on Europe. This was true of the test ban negotiations<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d117fn3">Reference to the negotiations that culminated in
                                the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963.</note> in several different
                            ways, profoundly true of the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss>
                            negotiations and will be even more true of <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss>. We have not tried in the present paper to analyze
                            these interrelationships.</p>
                        <p>Finally, European security, broadly construed, includes economic and
                            technical matters, in addition to political and military ones. While <pb
                                n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0387"/>these have not recently figured
                            in US-Soviet exchanges, they have done so at various times in the past
                            and they remain very prominent in intra-European contacts on East-West
                            issues. (Eastern Europe's relationship to the European Communities is a
                            problem complex of increasing weight if and as the Communities develop
                            and may in the middle run outweigh most if not all the other East-West
                            issues in Europe.) In any case, we do not get into this entire area in
                            the present paper.</p>
                        <p>Basically, despite the huge volume of documents and the smaller, though
                            considerable volume of private talk, the fact is that European issues
                            have not been ripe for concrete negotiation between ourselves and the
                            Soviets. Even today, with the volume of private talk picking up, the
                            issues have been largely procedural: do we or do we not have a
                            conference; how should it be prepared, etc. (For the Soviets,
                            admittedly, this has substantive interest since the mere convening of a
                            conference is of advantage to them.)</p>
                        <p>The one real substantive subject, that of our and Soviet troops, has not
                            been talked about seriously since Khrushchev and LBJ exchanged pen-pal

                                <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName>'s prodding
                            by indicating that the Soviets would give serious consideration to a

                            that serious <hi rend="italic">US-Soviet</hi> negotiations on this

                            soundings on Berlin, and the Soviets have shown some interest. But we
                            are probably well out of the bilateral channel on this one since (a) the
                            subject hardly promises to be productive for us and (b) we should do
                            nothing to undermine allied cohesion on this subject.</p>
                        <p>In sum, when all is said and done, direct US-Soviet negotiations on
                            Europe which would in any sense be directed at changing the status quo
                            would at present be either (a) artificial and contrived, or (b) not in
                            our interest, or (c) not in the Soviet interest. At the same time, while
                            the status quo is not all that bad right now for us, at least when
                            compared to other status quos, it is not desirable, or feasible, to seek
                            US-Soviet negotiations which would sanctify it. Of all the Western
                            powers we should be the last one to underwrite Moscow's free hand in
                            Eastern Europe (especially since we are in process of developing a
                            special relationship with Romania); and we certainly have no interest in
                            negotiating the disruption of the Western alliance with Moscow.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called in the morning,
                            saying he had an urgent set of matters to discuss. We set the
                            appointment for 4:30 in the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> began the conversation
                            by asking what had happened in Warsaw.<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">From
                                January 12–16, Chinese and U.S. representatives resumed talks in
                                Warsaw to explore an improvement in bilateral relations.</note> I
                            said I had not seen any reports yet. He asked whether I was going to
                            tell him what had happened in Warsaw. I replied that I didn't think he
                            would believe it if I told him and, in any event, we were not in the
                            habit of conveying our diplomatic conversations. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that China was a
                            neuralgic point with them. Of course, he recognized that China could not
                            represent a military threat to the Soviet Union until 1979, but people
                            were not very rational on that issue and we should keep this in mind. In
                            particular, we should not try <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0389"
                            />to use China as a military threat. I said that this seemed to me
                            vastly exaggerated. There was no possibility of China's representing a
                            military threat, and even less possibility of China's being “used,”
                            whatever that meant, by the United States. Our relations were so far
                            from normalcy that there was no sense even discussing such ideas.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he personally
                            agreed, but he just wanted to convey the intensity of feeling in Moscow.
                            I said we, too, had our neuralgic point: for example, broadcasts on the
                            Moscow radio in which American prisoners held in North Vietnam were
                            broadcasting to America. This was an unfriendly act. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had already been
                            informed to that effect by the State Department and he frankly did not
                            know enough about the situation to comment.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked whether he
                            could request a personal favor of me. A group of Soviet editors were
                            coming to the United States and would visit Washington on February 2nd
                            or 3rd. Would I be willing to see them? I said, yes, if it were done on
                            a strictly off-the-record basis. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he had never leaked to the press, and
                            their press was very disciplined. I said that I would be glad to see
                            them and that I would be delighted if he joined them. I would set aside
                            an hour on either February 2nd or 3rd.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> changed the conversation
                            and said a curious thing had happened. The First Secretary of the
                            Japanese Embassy had called on the First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy
                            to inquire about a remark I allegedly made to the Japanese Ambassador to
                            the effect that we were planning a summit meeting with the Soviet Union
                            in late summer or early fall. Was there anything to this remark? I said
                            that I had never talked to the Japanese Ambassador alone on any subject
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> could be
                            assured that if the subject of summits ever were raised by us, it would
                            be done strictly between <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            and me, and no foreign ambassador—indeed, no other member in our
                            bureaucracy would be involved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that Moscow
                            wanted to reiterate how much it welcomed our readiness to engage in
                            direct talks between him and me on a variety of subjects. He recommended
                            that we take two subjects first—Europe and <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss>. We would discuss these subjects thoroughly, one
                            subject at a time. I said that he had to understand that our discussions
                            would have to be entirely hypothetical, a position the President had
                            often explained. The final resolution would depend on a number of
                            factors, including the overall political climate. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood.
                            Nevertheless, in a few days he would take the initiative to propose a
                            meeting on Europe. He suggested that I then take the initiative in
                            proposing a meeting on <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, but that
                            the second meeting should take place no later than the first week in
                            March, and the first meeting proportionately earlier. I told him that I
                            would be interested to hear some concrete proposals on Europe, though,
                            so far, the topics had not seemed too promising. He said he would be
                            concrete.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned the
                            conversation to West Berlin and handed me some talking points about the
                            situation in West Berlin which he considered extremely grave and
                            provocative. The note itself was very tough (it is attached to a
                            separate memorandum).<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">Printed as attachment
                                below. The démarche was also sent as an attachment to a January 22

                                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> made four
                                recommendations which the President approved: “1) you have noted the
                                Soviet statement on Berlin; 2) you cannot agree that the German
                                actions referred to contradict past U.S.-Soviet exchanges regarding
                                Berlin; 3) we have no desire to have any tension over Berlin and
                                hope this is also true for the Soviets since any crisis in that area
                                would have an adverse effect on our relations; 4) we continue to be
                                prepared to seek genuine improvements in the situation in Berlin and
                                for this reason have joined with our Allies in proposing talks on
                                the subject.” (National Archives, <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                            talking points and if I had any reply to give, I would make it. However,
                            I saw no sense in our discussing Europe if there were even the prospect
                            of a unilateral Soviet action on Berlin. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Union did not make much
                            fuss last year when the German President was elected in Berlin, but now,
                            in effect, the whole German Parliament was meeting in Berlin again in
                            the guise of various committees, and this could not continue.</p>

                            <p>The authorities of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> have
                                officially announced their intention to hold sessions of the
                                Bundestag committees as well as meetings of the factions and other
                                parliamentary organs of the Federal Republic in West Berlin in the
                                next few weeks. Moreover provocative nature of such a venture not
                                only is unconcealed but rather is openly displayed—an attempt again
                                to use West Berlin to aggravate international situation.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Government has drawn the attention of the Government of
                                the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to serious consequences
                                which this course of action <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0391"
                                />by Bonn in West Berlin affairs may have. The question of West
                                Berlin has also been touched upon in the recent conversations of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador in the GDR with
                                the US Ambassador in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and,
                                therefore, the American side must be aware of our views on this
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>The state of West Berlin affairs was already discussed in my
                                conversations with you, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName>, in February and March last year.<note
                                    n="5" xml:id="d118fn5">See <ref target="#d14">Documents 14</ref>
                                    and <ref target="#d27">27</ref>.</note> At that time it was
                                noted on the American side that it was necessary to avoid repeating
                                what had occurred around West Berlin in connection with holding
                                presidential elections there.<note n="6" xml:id="d118fn6">See <ref
                                        target="#d3">Document 3</ref>.</note> It was also noted that
                                events there should not make Soviet-American relations feverish and
                                that third countries should not be allowed to make crises in West
                                Berlin from time to time. This viewpoint has been taken into account
                                by us in our final consideration of practical steps to be taken with
                                regard to West German provocations.</p>
                            <p>On the basis of the known facts we cannot come to the conclusion that
                                the American side has reciprocated. Without getting now into the
                                matter of Soviet-American exchange of views on the West Berlin
                                question which for reasons, better known to you, Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, did not materialize, we
                                cannot but point out, however, the obvious discrepancy between the
                                political evaluations and practical measures by the US
                                Administration, in the question of West Berlin as well.</p>
                            <p>The line of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> in West Berlin
                                matters has been and continues to be incompatible with the status of
                                West Berlin. The special status of West Berlin as an entity existing
                                separately from the Federal Republic and not subject to its
                                jurisdiction is an objective fact which has found its reflection in
                                US official documents as well. This is the only ground for mutual
                                understanding between our powers in this matter.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Government does not accept arguments to the effect that
                                this sort of demonstration on the part of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> took place in West Berlin in the
                                past. Violation of law does not make new law. Repetition of
                                violations may only have as its consequence taking of more serious
                                measures which will show that West Berlin is not the right place at
                                all for stirring up tension in Europe notwithstanding the attitude
                                of other countries towards the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                                actions in West Berlin.</p>
                            <p>You, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, have
                                suggested to openly exchange considerations on questions where the
                                interests of the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                closely adjoin. We would like to express today a wish that the US
                                Government give anew a thorough thought to the situation developing
                                around West Berlin.</p>
                            <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0392"/>
                            <p>Clearly, there can be no two views about the fact that the actions by
                                the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> authorities are far from
                                contributing to a better climate for exchange of opinion on West
                                Berlin. The motives of actions by certain circles in Bonn are
                                obvious. But what is the guiding criteria of the Governments of the
                                Western powers who bear their share of responsibility for West
                                Berlin and who show indulgence towards the unlawful policy of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>? In any case the Soviet
                                Government cannot but take into consideration all those
                                circumstances and draw from them appropriate conclusions about the
                                positions of the parties.</p>
                            <p>I have instructions to convey these considerations to the attention
                                of the President and to express our hope that the American
                                leadership share the concern of the Soviet Government over the
                                continuing attempts by some circles to make Soviet-American
                                interests clash, in such an acute point as West Berlin as well.
                                Failure to take measures to cut short such attempts would amount to
                                contradicting the special obligations for maintaining peace and
                                security which rest on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                the US.</p>

                                    It is a fair and balanced document which meets the legitimate
                                    concerns of both sides.</p>
                                <p>There is need for negotiations between the parties to begin
                                    promptly under <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                    auspices. The October 28 and December 18 documents deal with the
                                    key issues of pace, withdrawal and negotiations to reach the
                                    agreement called for in the UN Security Council Resolution of
                                    November 1967. These two documents provide an equitable
                                    framework which would enable Ambassador <persName
                                        corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> to convene the parties
                                    immediately and get on with his task of promoting the just and
                                    lasting peace called for by the Security Council resolution. In
                                    this connection, the Soviet contention that the US has now
                                    proposed to limit itself to “neutral formulas alone” is without
                                    foundation.</p>
                                <p>The Soviet oral response of December 23 and the position being
                                    taken by the Soviet representative in the Four Power talks on

                                    the prompt resumption of the <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                        >Jarring</persName> mission and have raised doubt in this
                                    government as to the Soviet desire for a stable and durable
                                    peace in the Middle East. We see no significant difference
                                    between the present Soviet position and the position stated in
                                    the Soviet proposals of December 1968 and June 1969.</p>
                                <p>We do not believe it is useful to comment on every point in the
                                    Soviet response of December 23 since the US position and the
                                    reasons for it have been fully explained to Soviet
                                    representatives on many occasions in the past. We do wish,
                                    however, to draw to the attention of the Soviet Government the
                                    following:</p>
                                <p>We note that the Soviet Government no longer supports the

                                    In the context of the resolution, this clearly means agreement
                                    between the parties concerned, which can only be achieved
                                    through a process of negotiations—A view which the Soviet
                                    Government indicated it shared in accepting on a contingent
                                    basis the Rhodes negotiating procedure in the proposed October
                                    28 joint document.</p>
                                <p>The Soviet response of December 23 misrepresents the US position
                                    on the question of withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from UAR
                                    occupied territory, implying that our position does not envisage
                                    such withdrawal when in fact our proposal makes clear that
                                    withdrawal should be to the former international boundary once
                                    the parties have agreed upon their commitments to a contractual
                                    peace and have negotiated between them under <persName
                                        corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s auspices the
                                    practical arrangements to make that peace secure.</p>
                                <p>The Soviet reply is completely unresponsive to our suggestions,
                                    on which we have placed particular stress from the start, for
                                    language to give specific content to the parties' commitments to
                                    the just and lasting peace. We note, in particular, that the
                                    Soviets have linked withdrawal not with the establishment of
                                    peace between the parties but with “cessation of the state of
                                    war.” The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will recall that
                                    the Security Council resolution is very specific: its principal
                                    objective is the establishment of a just and lasting peace
                                    between the parties. Does the Soviet Union agree with the
                                    specific formulations on peace contained in the suggested
                                    October 28 joint paper? A clear, and not evasive, response is
                                    required.</p>

                        <p>According to information now available the Israeli leaders, ignoring the
                            decisions of the Security Council have in fact resumed anew military
                            actions against the Arab states, including bombings of population
                            centers of the UAR in the immediate vicinity of Cairo. Not only military
                            installations of the UAR and Jordan are being attacked but also civil
                            population, destruction is being brought to towns, villages, industrial
                            and other installations. The aims of these adventurist actions are
                            clear—to force the neighbouring Arab countries into accepting the
                            demands which are put forward by Israel. All this takes place at a time
                            when the UAR and other Arab countries, honoring decisions of the
                            Security Council, are not so far<note n="2" xml:id="d121fn2">

                        <p>In this instance as in determining their position in Middle Eastern
                            affairs in general the Israeli leaders are evidently proceeding from the
                            assumption that the US will go on supporting Israel and that under these
                            circumstances the four great powers will fail to come to a common view
                            on the implementation of the decisions of the Security Council.</p>

                        <p>There is danger that in the immediate future the military actions may
                            become widescale while the decisions of the Security Council and the UN
                            General Assembly will be loosing weight in the eyes of world

                        <p>We are now studying the question to what extent the Israeli counting on
                            political and other support from outside has ground and has been
                            coordinated with the diplomatic actions by certain powers. We consider
                            it our duty however to draw your attention, Mr. President, to the highly
                            risky consequences the course chosen by the Israeli leaders may have
                            both from the point of view of the situation in the Middle East and
                            international relations as a whole.<note n="4" xml:id="d121fn4">

                        </p>
                        <p>We proceed from the conviction that stable peace can and should be
                            established in the Middle East. The Soviet Union has persistently
                            strived for this and has influenced its friends accordingly. If on the
                            other hand the US Government supported its pronouncements in favor of
                            peace in the Middle East by practical steps, and in the first
                            place—vis-à-vis the Israeli leaders, then there would not have been such
                            a situation in which for two years and a half the occupier continues to
                            hold the occupied lands, hundreds of thousands of Arabs are forced to
                            abandon their homes and people continue to perish.</p>
                        <p>Adherence by Israel to its present course may only widen and deepen the
                                conflict,<note n="5" xml:id="d121fn5">

                            of the world since it is impossible to force the Arab countries to
                            reconcile themselves to the aggression, to the seizure of their
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>It is in the interests of universal peace and international security to
                            warn the Government of Israel against adventurism, to undertake urgent
                            and firm actions, which will help in stopping the growth of military
                            tension and will make Israel listen to the voice of reason. We believe
                            that this would also correspond to the national interests of the United
                                States.<note n="6" xml:id="d121fn6">

                        <p>We would like to tell you in all frankness that if Israel continues its
                            adventurism, to bomb the territory of UAR and of other Arab states, the
                            Soviet Union will be forced to see to it that the Arab states have means
                            at their disposal, with the help of which a due rebuff to the arrogant
                            aggressor could be made.<note n="7" xml:id="d121fn7">

                        <p>The situation in the Middle East urgently dictates the necessity of
                            immediate cessation by Israel of its dangerous armed attacks and sorties
                            against the UAR and other Arab states.</p>
                        <p>The four powers are capable and must compel Israel to abandon its policy
                            of military provocations and to see to it that a lasting peace be
                            established in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>We believe that now it is necessary also to effectively use the mechanism
                            of bilateral and four-power consultations in order: 1) to ensure
                            speediest withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Arab
                            territories, 2) to ensure establishment of peace in the Middle
                                East.<note n="8" xml:id="d121fn8">

                        <p>Withdrawal of forces is the key question for establishing peace. If it is

                        <p>We would like you, Mr. President, to appraise the situation from the
                            viewpoint of special responsibility for the maintenance of peace which
                            lies on our countries. As for the Soviet Government, there is no lack of

                        <p>Several recent events have led the Kremlin watchers to conclude that
                            there may be trouble in the top Soviet leadership. Few observers are yet
                            predicting a major purge or the downfall of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PNV1"

                                >Kosygin</persName>, but the economic problems are serious enough
                            for some casualties to occur. Moreover, further economic reorganization
                            seems inevitable, which, in turn, would aggravate political
                            tensions.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What has been happening in the Soviet Union in the past several years is
                            that the rate of economic growth has been declining. Last year
                            industrial growth hit rock bottom, the lowest rate since 1946, and the
                            prospects are not much better for 1970. The overall economic growth was
                            only 2½ percent, the lowest since 1963.</p>
                        <p>Bad weather last year played a role, but the basic problems are a
                            decrease in industrial investment, and more important, a failure to
                            maintain increases in productivity—sometimes called the technological
                            gap.</p>
                        <p>After the fall of Khrushchev the new leaders set out to increase the
                            supply of consumer goods, and at the same time raise spending for
                            defense, including the large buildup in the Far East. Though they
                            recognized that the Soviet economy was stretched thin, they hoped that
                            an industrial reform involving use of the “profit system,” would provide
                            a new stimulus to investment and growth.</p>
                        <p>Last December, when Soviet party and government meetings were held to
                            review the state of the economy and approve the economic plan for this
                            year, matters came to a head. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> apparently made a long speech (never released)
                            in which he lambasted nearly everyone—planners, management, as well as
                            the average worker, for lack of discipline, poor performance by
                            ministries, etc. He was also highly critical of agriculture, primarily
                            failures in stockbreeding, and the decrease in the production of meat,
                            milk and eggs (a chronic Russian complaint).</p>
                        <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0403"/>
                        <p>No remedies are in sight, and what <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> offered was mainly exhortation to “improve
                            organization and management, strengthen discipline,” i.e., formulas
                            which date back to Khrushchev's days.</p>
                        <p>The reason, of course, is that the Soviet leaders are reluctant to face
                            up to the failure of their own industrial reforms. None of the leaders
                            can suggest a new program of reform which would spur economic progress
                            and at the same time preserve central political control. This is a
                            central Soviet dilemma.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">

                        <p>Added to these underlying problems have been a number of those signals
                            that the experts usually associate with political troubles in the
                            Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>Last November, the Soviet party, after numerous postponements, held a
                            huge conference on collective farming to create a Cooperative Farm
                            Union, empowered to direct regional agriculture. Instead a rather
                            meaningless advisory council was created and the meeting ended in great
                            disarray.</p>
                        <p>In the last several months there have been more than the usual number of
                            removals of middle to upper level echelon officials, including a party
                            secretary in the regional republics.</p>

                            that despite some evidence of political troubles, tensions are not
                            climbing sharply. The nearness of the Lenin 100th anniversary (April
                                1970)<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4">

                            on an even keel.</p>
                        <p>If and when the unity breaks down, however, <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> sees a possible generational split developing between

                            group. This latter group, chiefly First Deputy Premiers Mazurov and
                            Polyansky and the aggressive trade union leader Shelepin may be more and
                            more impatient with the temporizing policies of the older leaders.</p>
                        <p>The Party Congress, which is expected this year, might bring problems to
                            a head. All of the top leaders will want to ensure their supporters
                            retain key positions. The older group under <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> may try to expand its mandate at the Congress,
                            while the younger group would be inclined to block this prospect.</p>

                            the UAR-Israeli cease fire. We agree with the argument that we should
                            not appear to be excessively hurried and in fact we would not be ready
                            to respond before Tuesday.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, undue delay in informing the Soviets of our efforts
                            would play into their strategy to place the onus for the current
                            situation on the United States and to garner credit in the Arab world
                            for applying pressure on the United States and Israel.</p>
                        <p>There are several observations regarding the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> letter which are worth mentioning.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, its principal thrust seems to be to get us to get the
                                Israelis to lift the military pressure on <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. It could possibly signal
                                that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> may be about
                                ready to give up for the time being his war of attrition tactics and
                                he may be looking for a way out. The Rabat Conference<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d125fn3">Reference is to the Arab summit that included
                                    the defense and foreign ministers of 13 Arab countries, which

                                helped free <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s hands in
                                this regard, since he can always say his attempt to mobilize Arab
                                resources fell far short of what he needs. He is also freer after
                                Rabat to pursue a political solution if he so decides. This is why I
                                feel it is so important to continue to stand firm on our two United
                                States peace proposals and to maintain our efforts to convince Cairo
                                and Moscow to adopt a positive stance toward them, as has
                                Hussein.</item>
                            <item>Second, the inability of Cairo to respond effectively to the
                                Israeli deep penetration raids is no doubt embarrassing to Moscow.
                                We surmise, though we are not sure, that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                    >Kosygin</persName>'s letter stems from <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s reported trip to Moscow
                                which must also have involved further UAR arms requests. As a
                                minimum, we are reasonably certain that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> encouraged Moscow to come forward with a
                                concrete arms proposition to Jordan. The reference in the message
                                that the Soviets would be “forced to see to it that the Arab states
                                have means at their disposal” could signal that the Soviets have
                                taken a decision to give more arms to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName>, though there is nothing to indicate any
                                change in their policy of providing measured amounts, or that they
                                have decided provide more sophisticated weapons. It may also be
                                intended to discourage us from providing Israel with additional
                                arms. Moreover, short of nuclear weapons, the Soviets know as we do,
                                that more matériel to the UAR cannot have an immediate effect on the
                                arms balance or result in a sharp increase in UAR effectiveness,
                                since the problem is not hardware but Egyptian lack of training and
                                overall qualitative capacity. In short, the Soviets are in somewhat
                                of a squeeze at the moment, and it should not be precluded that in
                                time a more responsive reply to our two peace proposals will come
                                forth.</item>
                            <item>Third, while it might be tempting to make only pro-forma efforts
                                to achieve restoration of the cease fire and let pressure mount on
                                the Soviet Union and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>,
                                this carries with it elements of risk. Since Soviet <pb n="373"
                                    xml:id="pg_373" facs="0406"/>prestige is involved, they might
                                see themselves under increasing pressure to do something visible and
                                concrete to reverse the present trend. The Israeli attacks have made
                                their point psychologically and have achieved the military objective
                                of reducing their casualties on the Suez front. Much of the UAR
                                military capacity in the Suez area has been destroyed. If <persName
                                    corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> as a quid pro quo is ready
                                to abide by the UN cease fire resolutions and let up for the time
                                being on his declared war of attrition, it is in the Israeli and
                                United States interests to restore observance of the cease fire.
                                Moreover, as long as the deep penetration raids go on, it is
                                unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can take
                                any positive moves toward a peace settlement. This is not to say
                                that the converse is true; even if Israel relaxed its military
                                pressure, there is no assurance <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                    >Nasser</persName> would move toward a settlement.</item>
                            <item>Fourth, there are some important tactical considerations on how to
                                handle the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                                letter.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The letter has propagandistic overtones seeking to pin responsibility
                            exclusively on Israel and the United States. Our reply must be framed on
                            the assumption we may find it necessary and desirable to make it public
                            if the Soviets play their message that way.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet letter is firm, one sided, and is confined exclusively to the
                            Middle East; but it has an element of threat to us in that it first
                            implies we are in collusion with Israel and then warns of giving the
                            Arabs more means to rebuff the Israelis. Our response on this point in
                            particular should be firm.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> does not propose that the United States and the
                            Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics bring joint influence to bear on
                            both sides to restore the cease fire; his focus is primarily on Israeli
                            responsibility for the situation, American collusion, and the need for
                            total Israeli withdrawal. For this reason, I suggest that your reply
                            inform <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> of the steps we
                            have taken and are taking through diplomatic channels to ensure
                            compliance with the UN cease fire resolutions. We believe that joint
                            action by the Four Powers is undesirable since it would offer more
                            opportunity for the Soviets to exploit this as responsive to their
                            pressure. We therefore should tell the UK and France that we agree that
                            the UN cease fire should be restored, that our own efforts have been in
                            train for some time, and that each should do what he can through
                            diplomatic channels to help bring about a mutually respected cease
                            fire.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we believe your reply should place considerable emphasis on the
                            need for a positive reaction by the Soviets to the two United States
                            peace proposals.</p>

                        <p>Your message of January 31 has been studied carefully.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d126fn2">
                                <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> For its part, the
                            United States intends to continue its efforts to promote a stable peace
                            between the parties in accordance with the UN Security Council
                            Resolution of November 22, 1967<note n="3" xml:id="d126fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d2fn4">footnote 4, Document 2</ref>.</note> and to
                            encourage the scrupulous adherence by all concerned, not just one side,
                            to the cease-fire resolutions of the United Nations. I can assure you,
                            Mr. Chairman, this is the steadfast policy of the United States.</p>
                        <p>We do not accept the views expressed by the Soviet Government in
                            explanation of the current situation in the Middle East. We have been
                            using our influence with both sides urging strict observance of the
                            cease-fire. Thus any implication that the United States has been a party
                            to or has encouraged violations of the cease-fire is without
                            foundation.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, your attempt to place responsibility on one side is not
                            supported by the facts; there have been repeated violations of the UN
                            cease-fire resolutions by both sides. Full compliance with these
                            resolutions on all fronts, including the prevention of fedayeen attacks
                            against Israel, would help establish a more favorable atmosphere for
                            progress towards a settlement.</p>
                        <p>As I have pointed out, the United States, just shortly before the receipt
                            of your letter, discussed this matter with both Israel and the UAR and
                            urged both sides to adhere strictly to the UN cease-fire resolutions. We
                            intend to continue these discussions in order to bring about early
                            restoration of the cease-fire between Israel and the UAR. It will be
                            recalled that in early 1969 the UAR announced and initiated a policy of
                            non-observance of the cease-fire. An early indication by the UAR that it
                            will abide by the UN cease-fire resolutions if Israel will do the same
                                <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0408"/>would contribute to a
                            reduction of tension and violence and facilitate a political solution.
                            We are prepared to continue our efforts in that direction. We are not
                            aware of any recent Soviet efforts to this end.</p>
                        <p>We have noted the reference in your message to the effect that “the
                            Soviet Union will be forced to see to it that the Arab states have means
                            at their disposal…”.<note n="4" xml:id="d126fn4">Ellipsis is in the
                                source text.</note> The United States has always opposed steps which
                            could have the effect of drawing the major powers more deeply into the
                            Middle East conflict. This could only complicate matters further.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, the United States: (1) supports the prompt restoration
                            of the cease-fire; and (2) favors an understanding on limitations of
                            arms shipments into the area. The question of arms limitations was
                            raised directly with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            in July of last year, our willingness to discuss this important subject
                            was reaffirmed in my speech before the General Assembly<note n="5"

                                18.</note> Our proposals for discussion of this matter were rejected
                            by the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>While preferring restraint, as I indicated on January 25, the United
                            States is watching carefully the relative balance in the Middle East and
                            we will not hesitate to provide arms to friendly states as the need
                            arises.</p>
                        <p>On the broader question of a peace settlement, the United States remains
                            committed to help achieve a peace agreement between the parties as
                            called for by the UN Resolution of November, 1967. We have noted your
                            point to the effect that if the question of withdrawal were resolved,
                            there would be no serious obstacles to agreement on other questions. As
                            you know, there can be no withdrawal unless there is full agreement
                            between the parties on all of the elements of a peace settlement. In
                            this connection, the proposals of October 28 and December 18, 1969,<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d126fn8">See <ref target="#d98">Document 98</ref> and

                            meet the legitimate concerns of both sides on all key questions,
                            including withdrawal. We believe these proposals constitute reasonable
                            guidelines which would provide Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> the means to start the indispensable process of
                            negotiations between the parties under his auspices. It is a matter of
                            regret that Soviet unresponsiveness <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                                facs="0409"/>to these proposals is holding up this process; a more
                            constructive Soviet reply is required if progress towards a settlement
                            is to be made.</p>
                        <p>We note your desire to work with us in bringing peace to this area. We do
                            not believe peace can come if either side seeks unilateral advantage. We
                            are willing to continue our efforts to achieve a stable peace in the
                            Middle East in a spirit of good will.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of whether it was intended as a serious diplomatic move or as
                            a pressure play—and the simultaneous and ostentatious transmittal of the
                            letter by Soviet Ambassadors suggests that it was intended to become
                            public—the purpose of the operation presumably was to get the Israelis
                            to desist. In addition, the Soviets no doubt would have wanted to keep
                            the three Western powers off balance and arguing with each other and to
                            maintain the gulf that has been opening between us and the Israelis.
                            Beyond this, they must be anxious to keep their reputation as an
                            effective protecting power of the Arabs alive.<note n="3"

                        <p>It should not have taken much intelligence to expect at least the US (if
                            not France and the UK) to reply that it favors restoration of the
                            cease-fire on a reciprocal basis. Moreover, the Soviets must have known
                            by January 31 that we were already busy diplomatically in both Cairo and
                            Jerusalem to this end; and that the Israelis have already said that they
                            will abide by a reciprocally observed cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>Thus the upshot of the Soviet move will be to place the onus for getting
                            the cease-fire restored on <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            and the Arabs, and through them on the Soviets themselves, rather than
                            on us and the Israelis. But this produces a situation for which
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> can hardly be
                            grateful: if he gives any kind of positive response, he will be seen as
                            doing so under pressure of Israeli military action. In addition, it
                            would also point up <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s, and
                            Soviet, impotence since they seem unwilling or unable to control the
                            Fedayeen whose activities will presumably wreck any cease-fire after a
                            period of time.</p>
                        <p>If the cease-fire is not restored, as seems likely in view of Soviet
                            inability to deliver their clients, the Soviets are stuck with their
                            threat to provide means for a rebuff. But merely sending more equipment,
                            even if it is more advanced, is unlikely to accomplish anything, at
                            least if the past is any guide. So the onus of escalation is on the
                            Soviets and the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> letter
                            has added to its weight.</p>
                        <p>If one of the letter's purposes was to keep the Western powers at odds
                            with each other, or at least not to drive them more closely together,
                            its tone and content will tend to have the opposite effect. True, there
                            will be continuing differences about the utility of the four-power
                            forum, and to that extent the Soviets did not calculate incorrectly. But
                            the threat element has also produced a quickening of Western
                            consultation and efforts to attune the responses.</p>
                        <p>Another effect, which cannot be in Moscow's interest, is to dissipate
                            what had threatened to become a US-French confrontation on arms
                            shipments. The new, explicit Soviet threat to increase arms deliveries
                            has now, inevitably, drawn a response from us which explicitly ties the
                            arms issue back into the US-Soviet context (even though the French angle
                            remains as well).</p>
                        <p>Some have argued that whatever else the Soviets were attempting to do,
                            their main political purpose was to re-emphasize US identification with
                            Israel by (1) implying actual US-Israeli collusion, and (2) drawing from
                            the US a new statement of support for and defense of Israel which will
                            offset the impression of the last few weeks that we were drifting apart.
                            Even if it is granted that when the exchange is complete <pb n="378"
                                xml:id="pg_378" facs="0411"/>we will again look to be somewhat more
                            firmly on Israel's side, the ultimate effect of this may well not be in
                            Moscow's interest: if <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                            prepared to promise reciprocal observance of the cease-fire he will, as
                            noted above, be doing so in response to Israeli military pressure for
                            which we will also get some of the credit; if the fighting goes on
                            despite the Soviet threats, we will be credited with having faced down
                            the Soviets. Moreover, if there turns out to be some Soviet or Arab
                            flexibility with respect to our<note n="4" xml:id="d127fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> highlighted this part
                                of the paragraph and wrote the following comments: “I completely
                                disagree with this conclusion—The Soviets know that Arabs are long
                                on talk. We have been gloating over Soviet ‘defeats’ in the Mideast
                                since '67—State et al said the June war was a ‘defeat’ for Soviet.
                                It was <hi rend="italic">not</hi>. They became the Arabs' friend and
                                the U.S. their enemy. [unintelligible] this is what moves their
                                intent.”</note> October proposals, we will get the credit both for
                            having made those proposals and for having induced Soviet/Arab
                            flexibility by standing firm in the face of Soviet threats. While the
                            ensuing situation would involve us in problems with the Israelis, the
                            net effect would be to make us appear as the most influential outside
                            power in the region.</p>
                        <p>But if for some or all the above reasons the Soviet move is inept, it is
                            also disturbing. Since it is unlikely to produce a cease-fire, except
                            under conditions little short of humiliating for <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, the pressure on the Soviets to
                            make good on their threat will rise. This basic danger is not a new one;
                            but the Soviets have engaged more of their prestige and thus stand to
                            lose more of it if the Israeli attacks continue, and if our answer is
                            widely interpreted as a rejection of their threats. The Middle Eastern
                            problem has frequently lurked beneath the surface of Soviet leadership
                            politics and in 1967 was used by a rebellious faction in an indictment
                            against the present leaders. This could happen again under present
                            internal conditions in Moscow and lead the leaders to do something brave
                            to recoup.</p>

                        <p>In an earlier memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">
                                <ref target="#d127">Document 127</ref>.</note> I speculated on the
                            inept position adopted by the Soviets in the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> letter. At the time I thought that perhaps the
                            Soviet reaction reflected internal strains and frustrations in the wake
                            of an exasperating visit with <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was obviously bitter
                            about the Israeli raids, and especially the accuracy of the strike on
                            the house of the Soviet advisers, which he implied was deliberate. His
                            concern, however, was mainly on how to keep the incident quiet and out
                            of the public eye. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] also indicates that top Soviet military
                            leaders had been meeting on the Middle East and that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> had a personal hand in the
                            drafting of the letter to you. Thus, the raid of January 28 may have
                            triggered a Soviet decision to send the letters to you, Pompidou and
                            Wilson to justify a new shipment of Soviet arms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> refers to sending “a
                            system” after first sending “means of defense.” [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] sheds no further
                            light on what kind of weapons might be involved. One interpretation
                            could be that the new system will be offensive weapons (more advanced
                            aircraft or even tactical missiles) but that new radars or
                            surface-to-air missiles will have to be installed first. It could be
                            that both systems are defensive, however. We will watch this closely and
                            prepare a more extensive review of the possibilities in the next few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>As I noted, the ill-timed demand for a cease-fire played into our hands
                            quite nicely, in view of our efforts in Jerusalem and Cairo. This may be
                            explained by the fact that <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> expected the letters to go forward on that same
                            day (January 29), when in fact they were not delivered until January 31,
                            that is, after we had initiated our soundings on a cease-fire. The
                            desire of the top leaders to fire off an immediate démarche may also
                            explain the little thought given to whether a call for a cease-fire
                            would put <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in an untenable
                            position either to agree under pressure or turn down Israeli agreement
                            to mutual cessation.</p>

                        <p>In short, the Soviets seem to be responding emotionally to the killing of
                            Soviet advisers and out of frustration over their inability to do much
                            about the entire state of affairs. This, of course, could have some
                            ominous implications for future moves, since as I noted in my earlier
                            memorandum, the Middle East was a source of internal tensions within the
                            Soviet leadership at the time of the June war. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> may be worried that his own
                            position is vulnerable to charges of softness, and the letter could have
                            been for the record to protect himself against any new Kremlin debate
                            over Middle East policy. On the other hand, a failure of his initiative
                            may make him even more vulnerable. In this connection, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> referred to the “nervous
                            strain” of his job, and some trouble with his throat. This is the second
                            time in the last two months that we have noted <persName

                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">5 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] This
                            raises the question of what specifically the Soviets might have in mind.
                            To answer this question it is necessary to look at both the current
                            state of the Egyptian military forces vis-à-vis Israel and the realistic
                            options open to the Soviets.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The most basic fact about the Egyptian forces is that, despite all the
                            equipment the Soviets have provided since the 1967 war, they are still
                            no match for the Israelis. This is particularly true of the Egyptian air
                            force and air defense system. The Israelis have systematically knocked
                            out the Soviet-provided air defense positions along the Suez <pb n="381"
                                xml:id="pg_381" facs="0414"/>Canal almost as fast as they have been
                            set up and have proved that they can now fly their aircraft against
                            targets almost anywhere in the Nile Valley, including around Cairo.
                            Moreover, the Egyptian air force, with a severe shortage of trained and
                            qualified combat pilots, is unable to either challenge the Israelis
                            effectively in the skies over Egypt or to launch significant retaliatory
                            attacks against Israeli targets. The situation is so bad in fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> even admits it in
                            public. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> must have pressed
                            the Soviets very hard for the means to combat Israel's air supremacy
                            during his secret trip to Moscow January 22–26.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Assuming that the Soviets wish to avoid a major escalation of the
                            hostilities that would risk a confrontation with us, they do not seem to
                            have many options.</p>
                        <p>Their easiest choice would be simply to replace Egyptian losses by
                            rebuilding radar and SA–2 installations. This would carry the least risk
                            of further Soviet involvement, but would not significantly improve
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s position either,
                            since the Israelis have the capacity to keep knocking them out.</p>
                        <p>More and better planes—there has been speculation on an improved MIG–21
                            or so-called MIG–23—will not alone help <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>, although there may be pressure to provide them.
                            The Egyptians are unable to employ effectively what they already have.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> admitted this at the
                            Rabat Summit [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in an interview reported earlier this week.
                            Moreover, it would take too long to train the necessary Egyptian pilots
                            and technicians to operate the aircraft, related ground-control
                            facilities and air defense systems necessary to make an appreciable
                            impact on the present situation.</p>
                        <p>If the Soviets were to provide <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> with effective means to offset Israeli supremacy,
                            it would seem that they would have to begin inserting their own people
                            into more exposed combat positions, perhaps billed as “volunteers.” The
                            consensus developing at <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is that they
                            would begin to do this in defensive areas, perhaps providing more
                            sophisticated radar and air defense systems run by Soviet operators. The
                            low altitude SA–3 system, currently deployed outside the Soviet Union
                            only in Eastern Europe and even there only operated by Soviet personnel,
                            would seem to be the most likely candidate.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets could also begin to supplement Egyptian pilots with their
                            “volunteers.” This would also probably require the use of Soviet ground
                            controllers, since the Egyptians are not very effective in this area
                            either, the language problem would seem to necessitate this and Soviet
                            pilots have never been known to fly missions without using their own
                            people for ground support.</p>
                        <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0415"/>
                        <p>The Soviet aircraft-pilot-ground control option, however, while real,
                            runs a greater risk of significant escalation than providing and
                            operating more and new air defense facilities. The Israelis, among the
                            best and most experienced combat pilots, would surely be tough game for
                            the Soviet “volunteers” especially if they were inadequately supported
                            from the ground. The thought of Soviet pilots and planes being shot down
                            in Egypt and Israel must certainly give the Soviet pause for thought.
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> thinks that if Soviet pilots
                            were employed, they would be used for defensive missions only. This
                            would cut the risks some.</p>
                        <p>Another possibility is that the Soviets could help the Egyptians to
                            develop an air defense system similar to that employed by North Vietnam.
                            This would involve saturating areas to be defended with SA–2 missile
                            sites and more conventional anti-aircraft defenses for the lower
                                altitudes.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> highlighted this part
                                of the paragraph and wrote “Most likely. It worked in Vietnam
                                against us!” in the margin.</note> The present Egyptian MIGs could
                            also be used to backstop this arrangement or improved versions could be
                            employed if necessary. While this would involve equipment such as that
                            the Israelis have already destroyed, this approach would involve
                            quantities and concentrations not tried before in Egypt which might
                            increase the cost to Israel as they did to us in Vietnam. There are, of
                            course, differences in terrain which might make this harder to do in the
                            UAR. Soviet personnel would have to be used but in less directly exposed
                            positions on the ground.</p>
                        <p>There are other actions which the Soviets could take to buttress
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> militarily, but for
                            now they seem less real. Short range missiles for example are a
                            possibility. Such a move would run the strong risk of serious Israeli
                            retaliation and do nothing about Israeli freedom to strike any and all
                            Egyptian targets, military as well as industrial. Unless preceded by an
                            improved air defense ring of some kind, even short range missiles with
                            conventional warheads would be vulnerable to Israel preemptive attacks.
                            They would, of course, also raise the possibility of escalation of the
                            hostilities beyond a point where the Soviets might be able to maintain
                            some control over events.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, the situation is difficult for Moscow because the Soviets seem
                            to have little middle ground between involving their own pilots to make
                            Egyptian defense really effective and resigning themselves to what would
                            probably be a less than effective effort by ground technicians manning
                            anti-aircraft defenses. It is true that they did a creditable job in
                            North Vietnam and might try that approach. But if they <pb n="383"
                                xml:id="pg_383" facs="0416"/>once involve their pilots, their
                            prestige would be directly engaged, and someone would have to
                            lose—either the Soviets or the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>I have called a meeting of the Washington Special Action Group for
                                Monday<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">See <ref target="#d130">Document
                                    130</ref>.</note> to examine these possibilities and to refine
                            our contingency plans in response to them.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that the Soviets feel compelled to make some move in
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s support. The first
                            question is whether they will confine that move to a token gesture or
                            attempt to do something effective against Israeli attacks. If the
                            latter, this would almost certainly seem to involve Soviet personnel.
                            The second question, therefore, is whether they insert Soviet personnel
                            into direct combat situations or leave them, as they are now, in
                            defensive ground positions where they do not bring Soviet prestige into
                            face-to-face confrontation with Israel.<note n="4" xml:id="d129fn4">

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> summarized the
                            circumstances requiring the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> to
                            meet. There were hints that the Soviets might take some action, as yet
                            unspecified, in the Middle East. It was essential we make sure our plans
                            were in order and, that all possible contingencies had been examined.
                            The study prepared by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> suggested the
                            following possible Soviet actions: (1) improvement of UAR ground-to-air
                            defense, with some Soviet personnel made available for this purpose; (2)
                            introduction of Soviet pilots, probably with associated ground-control
                            installations; and (3) introduction of offensive weapons such as bombers
                            and missiles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked
                            if there were any new possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName> said there was nothing further to
                            add at this time. However, we might get some more information as a
                            result of the Cairo meeting, since <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> might tell his Arab colleagues what he expected
                            or had requested from the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he was
                            concerned about one further possibility—that the Soviet fleet in the
                            Mediterranean might take retaliatory action against Israel. Mr.
                                <persName>Karamessines</persName> commented that while anything <pb
                                n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0418"/>was possible, naval action did
                            not seem consistent with the thrust [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] by Soviet officials regarding
                            the Near Eastern situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1"
                                >Saunders</persName> pointed out that naval action was considered in
                            the October 1969 <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> contingency plan
                            at Tab H, where it was suggested that we might respond by taking action
                            against the Alexandria port facilities.</p>
                        <p>After noting that consideration should also be given to the more remote
                            possibility of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s loss of
                            power, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested
                            that the military situation in the Middle East and the options open to
                            the US be reviewed and considered by the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> on Wednesday, February 11.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked about the
                            timing of possible Soviet action. Mr. <persName>Davies</persName>
                            suggested that the Soviets would move quickly for psychological
                            purposes. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName> observed
                            that they might wait to see what decision we made on aid to Israel in
                            the wake of <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s letter<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d130fn3">
                                <ref target="#d121">Document 121</ref>.</note> to the President. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he had noted
                            the same theory in the press and asked who was putting out this idea.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName> said that it
                            appeared to be a complete fabrication, perhaps disseminated by the
                            Soviet Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Pranger</persName> noted that [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] the Soviets would be
                            increasing their freighter traffic through the Bosporus in the next few
                            days. Mr. <persName>Davies</persName> suggested that the Soviets might
                            just announce that they were going to provide air cover to Cairo; and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName> noted that, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            they could take the steps necessary to provide such an air defense
                            within one week.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            preceding discussion confirmed the need for a <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> meeting as early as February 11 to give preliminary
                            consideration to what the US should do. Discussion of the Middle East
                            situation could be completed at a subsequent <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> meeting on February 16. It was agreed that the
                            February 11 meeting should be scheduled late in the afternoon to provide
                            the maximum possible time for completing the necessary staff work.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked General Vogt
                            to have a look at the existing military contingency plans. He noted that
                            increased Soviet involvement would at the very least probably result in
                            some attrition of the Israeli Air Force, and that this would generate
                            pressure for US aid to Israel. General Vogt said the Israelis will
                            probably move to take out any new defensive system installed in Egypt by
                            the Soviets. He thought the Israelis had the capability to do so, even
                            if the defenses were manned by the Soviets.</p>
                        <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0419"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that the
                            implications of Soviet action would be different, depending on whether
                            or not the Soviets acknowledged that they were assuming responsibility
                            for the air defense of Cairo. If the Soviets maintained that an improved
                            defense system was Egyptian, even though run by the Soviets, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> would probably be under less
                            immediate internal pressures to retaliate in the event Soviet personnel
                            were injured by Israeli attacks. In either case, however, we are likely
                            to face a difficult situation. If Soviet help on air defense results in
                            losses for the Israeli Air Force, we will probably get requests from
                            Israel for aid. On the other hand, if the Israelis challenge the new
                            defenses, the Soviets will eventually feel compelled to respond. They
                            may act immediately if they have publicly acknowledged responsibility
                            for Egyptian air defense; the time fuse may be a few months longer if
                            the presence of their personnel is unacknowledged.</p>
                        <p>General Vogt pointed out that Soviet interest in defensive armaments for
                            the UAR suggested that they were anticipating Israeli attacks. Thus, the
                            Soviets might seek to keep their involvement covert. He observed that
                            the Israelis had taken out all of the earlier Soviet SA–2 installations
                            that threatened Israeli operations in the Cairo area. [<hi rend="italic"
                                >2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] General Vogt added
                            that if the Soviets were to install the more sophisticated SA–3's in
                            Egypt, they would be taking a major new step, since these weapons had
                            never heretofore been deployed outside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. One result might be an Israeli request to us for more
                            sophisticated counter-measures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Saunders</persName> noted that the
                            existing <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> plan did not cover the
                            contingency of Soviet intervention solely for the purpose of defending
                            the UAR, with Soviet units and aircraft operating only within Egypt. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that it
                            seemed hard to see how Soviet action to install a major new defensive
                            system would not sooner or later escalate the conflict and lead to one
                            of the contingencies discussed in the existing plan. The Israelis would
                            feel compelled to challenge the new defenses, and this could lead to a
                            Soviet-Israeli confrontation.</p>

                            questions, General Vogt said that Israeli pilots in F–4's or Mirage
                            III's would probably be more than a match for Soviet pilots in Mig 21's.
                            He doubted that the Israelis would lose one plane for every two lost by
                            the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then turned to possible Soviet supply of offensive
                            missiles to the Egyptians. Mr. <persName>Davies</persName> emphasized
                            the concern which would be generated in Israel if the Soviets were to
                            announce the installation of missiles with a 200-mile range. In response
                            to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s questions,
                            General Vogt said that the Soviets could provide a missile such as the
                            Frog which has a two-mile CEP (circular error, probable) at a range of
                            200 miles. This would permit bombardment of the Tel Aviv suburbs. With
                            high explosive warheads, this would be <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387"
                                facs="0420"/>primarily a terroristic weapon and would cause little
                            damage. General Vogt added that the Israelis soon will also have an
                            offensive capability in the form of the Jericho missile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if the Soviet
                            decision to aid the Egyptians was irrevocable. Mr.
                                <persName>Davies</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Karamessines</persName> agreed that it was. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked if anything was to be
                            achieved by our trying to warn the Soviets against such a step. Mr.
                                <persName>Davies</persName> suggested that it would be desirable to
                            intensify our diplomatic effort toward a cease fire, and Mr.
                                <persName>Karamessines</persName> added that this would help us in
                            dealing with public opinion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> then asked that Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> send over a paper dealing with
                            this “today” (February 9).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that one
                            explanation for the spate of Soviet Embassy-inspired stories linking a
                            US decision on aid to Israel with the <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> letter was that the Soviets had made the
                            decision to step up assistance to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> and were attempting to shift to us the blame for
                            escalating the dispute. He suggested that if we moved fast on the
                            diplomatic front, we could appear to be making a response to the Soviets
                            and might thus stave off another Israeli request for aid. He added that
                            it was important that the ad hoc Under Secretaries group on aid to
                            Israel meet on February 16. The staff paper prepared for the Under
                            Secretaries must be coordinated with our other planning, so that we
                            would be able to decide what aid levels to Israel would be appropriate
                            in the light of foreseeable Soviet moves in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked about the
                            possibility of avoiding US Government decisions on aid to Israel while
                            allowing the Israelis to purchase military equipment in this country. We
                            would, of course, want to know what the Israelis were buying, but we
                            would make no announcements. Mr. <persName>Davies</persName> agreed that
                            the less that was said on the record, the easier it would be for us to
                            aid Israel. It was agreed that our ability to do this would depend to
                            some extent on the type of equipment the Israelis were seeking.</p>
                        <p>General Vogt suggested that arrangements could be worked out with the
                            Israeli Air Force to keep Israeli purchases as quiet as possible. He
                            added that it would be useful to see how our equipment fares against
                            that which the Soviets might supply.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> directed that the
                            possibility of tacit US facilitation of Israeli purchases be covered in
                            the study being prepared for the Under Secretaries group. He added that
                            if a decision were made to offset Soviet equipment supplied to <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, we needed to consider what we
                            should do. We also needed to decide whether the introduction of Soviet
                            combat personnel into Egypt would trigger one of the contingencies
                            covered in existing plans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that in
                            connection with the current review State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> prepare an analysis of Soviet moves in the light of the
                            overall power balance in the Middle East and Africa. Possible
                            establishment <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0421"/>of a Soviet power
                            base in this area was a matter of serious concern.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that the
                            best means of warning the Soviets might be a <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            meeting on achieving a cease-fire. Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName>
                            and Mr. <persName>Davies</persName> agreed. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> address this
                            matter in the memorandum to be submitted “this afternoon” (February 9).
                            At the suggestion of Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also suggested that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> consider in his
                            memorandum the possible advantages of publicizing promptly any measures
                            which the Soviets might take to step up their aid to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ware</persName> said that in considering this we ought to
                            think about where it leads in terms of US involvement in the Middle
                            East. Mr. <persName>Pranger</persName> suggested we might try to warn
                            the Israelis about the increased dangers of attacking Egyptian defenses
                            in the event the Soviets openly acknowledged their own involvement. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> doubted that we
                            could ask the Israelis not to attack or tell them that we would not
                            provide them aid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then directed that
                            Tab D (response to Soviet overt intervention in renewed Arab-Israeli
                            hostilities) and Tab H (action by Soviet naval forces) of the October
                            1969 <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> contingency plan be reviewed
                            in the context of the current possibilities for Soviet action in Egypt
                            which might result in attrition to the Israeli Air Force and damage to
                            Israeli territory. A judgement was needed on the circumstances under
                            which we would prefer each of the options discussed in the October 1969
                            plan: military aid to Israel, interdiction of Soviet supplies, and US
                            military intervention. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> again emphasized the importance of considering
                            the problem in the context not just of the Arab-Israeli dispute but of
                            the overall power situation in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>In answer to General Vogt's question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>

                        <p>When I was finished, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                            extremely affable. He said he understood perfectly. He wanted to assure
                            me that the Soviet leaders <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0423"/>had
                            no intention of exacerbating tensions. They had, however, wanted to
                            indicate that the situation was getting serious. The primary concern of
                            the Soviet leaders was another round of the arms race in the Middle
                            East, just as we had indicated.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Soviets were displeased by the tactics that were
                            being used; for example, at the precise moment that the President's
                            reply was handed to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> was handing the text of the
                            reply to Ambassador Lucet. Considering that the letter was written by
                            the Soviet Prime Minister to the American President, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> thought that the reply might
                            well have been handed back by the Secretary of State. At any rate, it
                            would have been more polite to let the Soviet Ambassador have it an hour
                            or two before the allies of the United States. Secondly, it did not make
                            a very good impression on the Soviet Union that the essence of the reply
                            was leaked to the press before it could even have been received in
                            Moscow. This was a beef with the general tactics used by the State
                            Department. For example, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s
                            reply to the Soviet answer to our memorandum of October 28th<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d131fn3">The Soviet oral reply is in <ref target="#d98"
                                    >Document 98</ref>.</note> was leaked to the press five hours
                            before it was transmitted to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. As a result, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had the essence of the reply in his pocket
                            before <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> even started
                            speaking. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said,
                            moreover, that the State Department had misrepresented the Soviet note
                            of December.<note n="4" xml:id="d131fn4">
                                <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> It was not intended
                            as a rejection of our proposals of October 28. On the contrary, it
                            represented a direct invitation for further talks, and it was
                            deliberately presented as being negotiable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was a very mild man, and he was
                            astonished to read in the American press that his letter was intended to
                            convey a threat. The letter had intended to state the dilemmas of the
                            Soviet Union in the Middle East and the problems that were being raised.
                            I said I was glad to hear that because I could only underline what I had
                            said earlier—that the introduction of Soviet combat forces would have
                            the most serious consequences. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he understood perfectly, and he only hoped
                            that we took into account Soviet problems when we made any decisions
                            about future weapons deliveries to Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me whether he
                            had understood me correctly that the Middle East could be the subject of
                            conversations in the <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> channel. I said, yes—not in the detail that had
                            been characteristic of his talks with <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName>, but rather in terms of general principles. If we
                            could come to some understanding of general principles, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> could handle the details.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would report
                            this to <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0424"/>Moscow, and he was sure
                            that they would be glad to hear it. Moscow wanted to know whether we
                            were engaged in a propaganda battle or in a serious effort to settle,
                            and he repeated that the Soviet note of December did not represent the
                            last Soviet word on the subject.</p>

                                <item>—open Soviet involvement in the air defense of Egypt, perhaps

                                <item>—introduction of an offensive weapons system such as

                        <p>If the Soviets involve themselves openly, this will raise serious
                            questions for us: Can we afford to let the Soviets openly assume
                            responsibility for the defense of a Mid-Eastern nation without
                            responding? On the other hand, is it in the U.S. interest to move toward
                            a confrontation with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> over
                            Israel's strategy of bombing the UAR?</p>
                        <p>These larger questions are being dealt with urgently this week in the
                            Special Actions Group.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">See <ref

                                    >134</ref>.</note> However, since it is patently preferable—if
                            possible—to prevent this kind of situation from developing, the tactical
                            question today is whether we should follow up your letter to <pb n="392"
                                xml:id="pg_392" facs="0425"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            <note n="4" xml:id="d132fn4">
                                <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref>.</note> with approaches to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and perhaps
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> (Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> sees him Wednesday for a broad
                            discussion) to caution against dangerous escalation.</p>
                        <p>This would have to be done delicately since the obvious Soviet counters
                            will be that we should first halt Israel's bombing and agree not to ship
                            more arms to Israel. We would also have to avoid giving the impression
                            that recent Soviet moves have us excessively worried.</p>
                        <p>Our answer on each of the first substantive points could be that (1) we
                            are prepared to work with Israel for return to observance of the
                            cease-fire provided both sides agree and (2) we are prepared to discuss
                            arms limitation to both sides.</p>
                        <p>The most delicate question is how we show our own resolve. So far we have
                            indicated our determination not to let the local arms balance shift
                            against Israel. Since Israel's superiority over the Arabs is
                            substantial, that would not be difficult to achieve even with small
                            shipments. But if the Soviets enter the picture, more may be required
                            and our response would assume a direct anti-Soviet character.</p>
                        <p>For the moment, it is probably best to stick to language expressing
                            strong concern over escalation, (1) repeating our intention not to
                            permit a change in the military balance and (2) leaving to the
                            imagination what “escalation” means as far as we are concerned.</p>
                        <p>I believe some such approach is desirable. Your letter to <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> set the stage but some
                            follow-up would give us a better feel for what it is possible to achieve
                            with the Soviets in the way of restoring the cease-fire and achieving
                            some slowing of the arms race.</p>
                        <p>In my next talk with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> I
                            could make the points that (1) The introduction of Soviet combat
                            personnel would be an act of the gravest sort and (2) we are willing to
                            continue talks with them to find a peaceful solution. But in diplomatic
                            channels, there are two ways of making such an approach: <list>

                                    disadvantage of being pointed only at the Mid-East and perhaps
                                    displaying excessive concern and running across direct
                                    approaches we might make to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                ceasefire and reports of additional military assistance to UAR, I
                                wished to caution against such assistance as could increase the
                                level of violence on both sides. For this reason, the <gloss

                                other steps of extraordinary nature, we would have no alternative

                                first. He said <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could not
                                consider ceasefire outside the context of actions which Israel is
                                taking. These actions are flagrant military provocations, and are
                                expression of Israel's complete ignoring of UN decisions. Soviets
                                must draw conclusion that US statements that it will take steps
                                toward Israel and will cool off extremist statements have not been
                                justified. Ceasefire and <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> situation
                                cannot be discussed without considering concrete actions being taken
                                by Israel, which is carrying out systematic, provocative attacks on
                                Arab states. Neither <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nor USA
                                has received reports that UAR actions are not consistent with UN
                                decisions. It is not UAR, Syria, Jordanian, or other Arab troops
                                which are on Israeli territory, but the reverse. <persName

                                wished to remind the US of Sov. Govt. position, which has been
                                expressed in messages to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                                by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to the President.
                                Moscow is not against discussing question of limiting arms
                                deliveries to the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. However, <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proceeds from idea that for all
                                practical purposes such discussion is not possible while <pb n="394"
                                    xml:id="pg_394" facs="0427"/>Israel occupies Arab territories.
                                To discuss matter while Israeli troops are on Arab territories
                                creates false, distorted situation. If <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> wishes to find just solution to this question, it
                                cannot object to the Soviet Government's position. When the question
                                of the withdrawal of Israeli troops is resolved, as well as other
                                problems relating to Middle Eastern settlement, our two sides could
                                begin to discuss question of limiting arms deliveries to <gloss

                                and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would face tremendous
                                difficulties on limiting arms deliveries. Any possible agreement
                                would depend, however, on concrete positions of parties.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviet
                                Government had paid attention to statement expressed in President's
                                message to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> regarding
                                US interest in restoring relative balance in the event anything is
                                done for benefit of the Arabs. He said <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> regrets that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                                poses the question way it has. Israel, which ignores UN decisions,
                                occupies Arab territories and by its policies, is source of tension
                                and acute situation in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. In Soviet
                                view, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would occupy more just
                                position if it used all its possibilities and influence to bring
                                about reduction of tension in area exert influence on Israel,
                                instead of taking position it did in President's message. While
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> says <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should exert influence on Arabs,
                                the victims of Israeli aggression, and hints that in interest of
                                maintaining the balance US will take certain steps, the US is making
                                statements regarding new deliveries of phantoms. Mention is made of
                                dozens of plans, but perhaps it may be more. US actions can only
                                complicate the situation. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                                proposals are one-sided, pro-Israel and not objective. They are not

                                begin to retreat from its previous positions, would reorient its
                                stand. Such an approach undermines all positive movement in

                            <item>I responded by saying my remarks were intended to follow up on the

                                    >Kosygin</persName> and to draw attention to the 3 special
                                suggestions which might help the situation in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. I did not wish to recapitulate the
                                President's letter, which I was certain would receive due
                                consideration by the Soviet side. I noted the President had said the
                                ceasefire had been violated by both sides, and that the UAR in early
                                1969 had announced a policy of not observing the ceasefire. I wished
                                to stress, however, that a ceasefire was a means and not an end in
                                itself, but intended to moderate the current situation and to
                                facilitate negotiations for a settlement. Under such circumstances
                                why would anyone want to oppose a ceasefire. I added that, should
                                the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decide to provide planes to
                                Israel, this would be done in light of the balance existing in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, a balance which might be
                                disturbed by Soviet deliveries to the Arabs. The US has been frank
                                in its position, for example President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                            <item>Referring to <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s
                                assertion that US seemed to be backing off from various positions on
                                    <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, I pointed out that any
                                changes we had made were for the purpose of finding a fair-handed
                                solution. Actually, the evolution in our position had sometimes been
                                made for this purpose in the direction of Arab and not solely
                                Israeli interest and had been in response to Soviet urging, as for
                                instance in the the matter of outlining our ideas on frontiers. We
                                certainly could not be accused of pointing our position toward a
                                more adamant, rigid line. In conclusion I stressed we fully
                                appreciate the importance the Arab states attach to withdrawal,
                                which is a key feature to our proposals. The Arabs, however, should
                                not underestimate what the establishment of peace means, not only to
                                the Israeli Govt., but also to world opinion at large.</item>

                                I responded briefly by saying I did not want to renegotiate
                                everything that had been done in New York and Washington, but wished
                                only to concentrate on certain points which the <gloss

                                noting I was pleased that the Soviets apparently also wish an early

                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> in his address to the
                            chiefs of state meeting in Cairo said the Soviets had promised him
                            support by all necessary means. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] officials confirmed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had visited Moscow and
                            claimed that the Soviets had committed themselves to supply all arms
                            needed to regain the occupied territories. Specifically, [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            officials spoke of Soviet willingness to offer Mig 23's and other
                            sophisticated air defense systems if the US provided Phantoms to Israel.
                                <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0431"/>General Vogt commented that
                            the Mig 23 seemed an unlikely choice, since it was in short supply, was
                            too sophisticated for the Egyptians, and was not suited to prevailing
                            air combat conditions in the UAR-Israel conflict.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName> mentioned reports that the Soviets
                            might supply surface-to-surface missiles with a range of up to 800 miles
                            and that Soviet pilots might be made available for purely defensive
                            purposes. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had spoken of
                            Soviet irritation at Israeli intransigence and particularly at injuries
                            to Soviet personnel from Israeli air attacks which had resulted in one
                            dead and several wounded, including a general. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, emphasizing the need to improve
                            his air defenses, had admitted that SAM's and radars had been taken from
                            the front lines to assist against low-level Israeli attacks against
                            Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName> also noted [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] estimates that in
                            Moscow <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> had requested both
                            offensive and defensive weapons and had found the Soviets generally
                            receptive. However, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] thought the Soviets might hesitate to supply
                            offensive weapons and would be more likely to strengthen Egyptian air
                            defenses with improved SA–2's, SA–3's, or anti-aircraft artillery. [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            believe that these improvements would require substantial Soviet
                            manning. General Vogt agreed that Soviet personnel would be needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName> said that a Soviet signal
                            intelligence ship returning from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea had
                            interrupted its voyage and was now operating south of Cyrpus.</p>
                        <p>General Vogt suggested that the Soviets might be expecting the Israelis
                            to introduce new electronic systems as a response to new armaments to be
                            given by the Soviets to the Egyptians. The Israelis might need new
                            equipment if the Soviets brought in SA–3's. Nevertheless, the
                            intelligence ship could not be required for this purpose in the near
                            future since installation of SA–3's would take a long time. Answering a
                            question from Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName>, General Vogt said
                            that the ship would probably not greatly improve Egyptian ability to
                            anticipate Israeli attacks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said the
                            explanations offered for the activities of the intelligence ship were
                            not very persuasive and asked that an analysis be prepared of Soviet
                            intentions in placing the ship off the Israeli coast.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Ware</persName> asked how many personnel might be involved
                            in operating SA–3's. General Vogt replied that there was little
                            information available but estimated that the total might be about the
                            same size as an SA–2 battalion, which had 700.</p>
                        <p>General Vogt added that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> thought
                            we ought to consider improving our capability to detect possible Soviet
                            moves. The group then <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0432"/>discussed
                            at some length various ways to increase reconnaissance, including
                            improvement of Israeli capabilities. General Vogt believed we could do
                            little in this line for the Israelis in the immediate future but might
                            be able to help increase their capabilities over the longer run. He
                            emphasized that in considering the need for better reconnaissance we
                            should think about a program to be conducted over a considerable period
                            of time. The consensus was that a decision on reconnaissance would not
                            be required prior to Tuesday, February 17. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> directed that proposals
                            covering all available intelligence capabilities be prepared for
                            discussion by the 303 Committee on February 17.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d134fn4">Minutes of this 303 meeting are in <hi

                            President by February 18.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that everything
                            points to the Soviets using our decision on aid to Israel as the peg for
                            action on their part to support <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> observed that Soviet inaction could very
                            quickly affect their standing in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that there were
                            three contingencies that needed to be considered: (1) an unacknowledged
                            Soviet move to strengthen UAR air defense by providing equipment and
                            technicians; (2) open Soviet acknowledgement of some Soviet
                            responsibility for UAR air defense; and (3) Soviet threat of offensive
                            action against Israel. The <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> should
                            list possible US responses to Soviet actions; these could be categorized
                            as diplomatic action, providing aid to Israel, and military measures. It
                            was agreed that the working group paper prepared as a result of the
                            February 9 <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting could serve as
                            a basis for this analysis. Once the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss> had assembled its findings, it could place them before
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> or the Ad Hoc Group on aid to
                            Israel.</p>
                        <p>The group then considered whether there was any sort of assistance the
                            Soviets could provide that would be effective in stopping the Israeli
                            penetration attacks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> pointed out that to stop the attacks would
                            imply that the Israelis would suffer substantial losses. This would
                            create additional problems for us. Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName>
                            said that intelligence reports indicated the Soviets might try to give
                            the Egyptians an anti-aircraft capability similar to that they had
                            provided the North Vietnamese. The consensus was that because of
                            Egyptian ineffectiveness, providing them such a capability would
                            probably mean the introduction of Soviet crews.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that estimates
                            be prepared of what would be required for an effective Egyptian air
                            defense, including how much <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0433"
                            />equipment and personnel would be needed and how transportation to
                            Egypt could be arranged. General Vogt suggested that the Egyptians were
                            concerned primarily about the Cairo area, and that this could probably
                            be covered with 10 battalions of ground-to-air missiles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested that
                            Soviet bombers and pilots might be the cheapest way of creating an
                            effective deterrent against Israeli attacks. General Vogt said that
                            Soviet bombers operating against Israeli defenses could well suffer
                            substantial losses. The Soviets would probably be reluctant to put their
                            prestige on the line in this way. Answering a question from Mr.
                                <persName>Pranger</persName>, General Vogt said that the
                            intelligence ship would not be useful to feed information to
                            bombers.</p>
                        <p>General Vogt said that one other possible defensive measure would be for
                            the Soviets to provide an SA–4 mobile system, with associated radar
                            facilities. This would not stop the Israeli penetrations but would make
                            them more costly. Responding to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName>'s question, General Vogt said that this
                            equipment could be transported by air but would involve tonnages far
                            greater than the Soviets have heretofore flown into Egypt. He noted that
                            the Soviets had obtained overflight permission from Turkey for previous
                            airlifts to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> again pointed out
                            that we would be faced with a problem if improved Egyptian defenses
                            inflicted losses which the Israeli Air Force could not withstand.
                            General Vogt said that even if the Egyptians had a system equivalent to
                            the North Vietnamese, losses would still not be great—perhaps one per
                            1000 sorties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName> asked about the status of
                            diplomatic efforts. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            said the approach to the Soviets discussed at the February 9 <gloss
                                target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> meeting had been approved and was
                            being made. Mr. <persName>Karamessines</persName> then asked about the
                            old proposal for withdrawal of forces from the Suez Canal. The consensus
                            was that there was no possibility that such an approach would be
                            effective at this time and that the basic problem remained the Israeli
                            penetration attacks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out that
                            diplomatic and supply pressures on Israel were an important part of the
                            inventory of measures which the US might take. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that the detailed planning
                            should be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with what we are now
                            working on. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed
                            and noted that the existing plans for the most part assumed a situation
                            in which the Israeli forces were being driven back in a Soviet-backed
                            effort to oust them from occupied territory. Mr.
                                <persName>Davies</persName> added that we should look closely at
                            those provisions of the contingency plan covering (1) interdiction of
                            Soviet supplies to Egypt and (2) a one-time retaliatory strike
                            responding to a Soviet attack on Israel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> cautioned that we would not wish to rush into
                            military action. Mr. <persName>Ware</persName> asked if we had the
                            assets to consider a retaliatory strike. General Vogt said that we could
                            mount a strike; but if <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0434"/>the
                            Soviets responded, they could rapidly outbid us. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> added that all the analysis
                            done so far had shown that the Soviets would be in a superior military
                            position in the event of a crisis in the Middle East. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stressed that it was
                            important that this point be made clear to the President.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked that the

                            proposals on providing military equipment to Israel. Later the Ad Hoc
                            Group could meet again to consider the overall US strategy in dealing

                        <p>I had lunch served in the downstairs Library at the White House Mansion
                            in order both to avoid the press' seeing <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> coming in and to avoid staff members' asking

                            by giving me a picture that I had seen at the Soviet photo show the
                            evening before. It is of a dog looking at a syringe with great
                            apprehension, and had amused me very much. He had written a little
                            inscription on the back.</p>

                        <p>We then turned immediately to the President's annual report,<note n="2"

                                excerpts of foreign media reaction. The Soviet reaction was given as
                                follows: “A Soviet writer commented in <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Izvestiya</hi> that ‘President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had
                            read the report with the greatest care and that he had found it on the
                            whole a well-balanced document. In fact, he thought that it would be
                            well received in the Soviet Union, except for a number of items. First,
                            he had noticed that there were only two foreign leaders mentioned in the
                            report—President <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName> and
                            President Ceausescu. This, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said, would rub people the wrong way. The
                            second thing, to which there would be great exception taken in the
                            Soviet Union, was the list in the Introduction of countries where the
                            Red Army had been used since 1945. I told him that, of course, he had to
                            understand the report was not written primarily for Moscow audiences and
                            that as far as the mention of Ceausescu was concerned, there was no
                            particular intention attached to it. He said he just wanted to be sure
                            that it was one of these drafting problems which might indicate a
                            certain priority in the President's attitude, but which was not directed
                            at the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked a number of
                            questions about the organizational part of the report. Specifically, he
                            wanted to know the difference between the group dealing with crisis
                            management and the groups dealing with programs—e.g., the differences
                            between the Verification Panel and the Washington Special Actions Group.
                            I gave him a rather general description. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that in the Soviet Union, of course,
                            decisions were taken in a different manner; that is to say, there was no
                            coordination between departments at a lower level. Each department
                            worked independently, and all issues were resolved at the higher
                            level.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked about a
                            phrase in the report which said that the only status quo in the world
                            today is the fact of change. Did that mean that we no longer recognized
                            the existing dividing lines in Europe? I said it was odd for a Marxist
                            to argue that such a phrase produced any difficulties, since after all,
                            all of Marxist theory was based on the theory of history. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> smiled and said that in Europe
                            we are fomenting the maintenance of the status quo. I said the
                            distinction had to be made between existing dividing lines in Europe and
                            existing frontiers. We certainly recognized all existing national
                            frontiers, but we did not recognize the East German boundary as a
                            national frontier. This did not, of course, mean that we would support
                            the use or the threat of force with respect to it.</p>
                        <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0436"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that this
                            explanation was perfectly agreeable to the Soviet Union. Could he
                            communicate it to his government? I told him that existing national
                            boundaries would not be challenged by this Administration, and I said as
                            far as I knew, I had never heard anyone express any different view.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he had been
                            puzzled because the previous Administration had given him formal
                            assurance to that effect, and we had not yet done that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to the issue
                            of sufficiency and said this was, of course, a very vague term on which
                            further discussion might be useful. He wondered in what respect the
                                <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> fitted into the sufficiency
                            concept. He said that it was unfortunate that Helsinki was immediately
                            followed by the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> announcement. I told
                            him that the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> announcement came up,
                            as he knew very well, as part of our regular budgetary cycle. It would
                            have come up in January regardless of Helsinki, and nothing had happened
                            in Helsinki that could affect our budgetary decisions. As he knew very
                            well, we were engaged in a purely exploratory conversation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked about the
                            difference between area defense and point defense. I gave him a very
                            crude explanation because I did not want to go into missile
                            characteristics. With the President's authority, I gave him a brief
                            account of what the request would be like for next year, and I told him
                            it was a minimum request which would keep the program going but which
                            would retain all options for <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he simply did
                            not understand how the Minuteman defense could also be useful for area
                            defense and how, if it was useful for area defense, it could make any
                            difference to the Soviets what our intentions were. I told him that the
                            best thing would be if I would let one of my technical experts explain
                            the system to him, and we arranged a meeting for some weeks ahead.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then read a little note
                            to me (attached)<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">Not attached.</note> which
                            did not, he said, represent a formal communication but some tentative
                            instructions. The note reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“At the time of the Helsinki meetings the American delegation
                                    emphasized that it displays business-like attitude toward
                                    discussing the problem of curbing strategic offensive and
                                    defensive armaments race. We would like to say frankly that
                                    further development raises questions on our side in this
                                    respect.</p>
                                <p>“We do not understand, in particular, what was that that guided
                                    the American side when despite agreement about the confidential
                                    nature of the talks it in fact released to the press through its
                                    various spokesmen many elements of the contents of the Helsinki
                                    negotiations. <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0437"/>Such an
                                    approach can hardly make a favorable impact on the atmosphere of
                                    the talks in the future.</p>
                                <p>“We would also like to stress that in the light of the exchange
                                    of views in Helsinki we are puzzled by the position on issues of
                                    strategic armaments taken by certain members of the U.S.
                                    Government, in particular, by the U.S. Secretary of Defense
                                        <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName>. Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> has recently come out
                                    demanding substantial speed-up in the deployment of the <gloss

                                    declared the intention to speed up the development of a new type
                                    of strategic bomber and underwater long-range missile system.
                                    The Pentagon also advocates development of a new ground-based
                                    intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
                                <p>“The demands by members of the U.S. Government that the U.S.
                                    should expedite nuclear missile arms race make for some thought
                                    as to the intentions here with respect to achieving agreement on
                                    curbing strategic offensive and defensive arms race.</p>
                                <p>“It is known that earlier, when the U.S. Government was taking
                                    its decision on deployment of the ‘Safeguard’ system President

                            this question. Israel is the source of the tension in the Middle East
                            and the U.S. would be in a “more just position” if it exerted maximum
                            pressure on the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>Instead the U.S. says that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            should exert pressure on the victims of Israeli aggression and hints
                            that in the interest of maintaining the balance we will take certain
                            steps (like new deliveries of Phantoms).</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">U.S. Proposals:</hi> The U.S. proposals for a peace
                            settlement are one-sided, pro-Israeli and not objective. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had made many efforts to reach an
                            agreement, but every time there was “some rapprochement” of positions
                            the U.S. would retreat to previous positions and undermine positive
                            movement in the negotiations. This is reflected in the Four Power talks
                            where the U.S. is taking a take-it-or-leave-it approach and which
                            promises little in the way of achieving agreement.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> later in the

                            is puzzled by the lack of progress since we seem to agree on the

                            reiteration of the positions the Soviets have been taking for some time.
                            They continue to place the entire blame for the escalation of the
                            fighting on the Israelis and picture the Arabs as the innocent victims
                            of U.S.-Israeli collusion. They show no inclination to press <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> on the restoration of the
                            cease-fire or a peace settlement. Similarly, the Soviets continue to
                            reject serious consideration of limiting arms shipments to the Middle
                            East on the grounds that nothing constructive can be accomplished until
                            there is a peace settlement. At the same time, they leave the door
                            slightly open to continuing bilateral talks with us or multilateral
                            talks including the British and French as a means of constructing a
                            diplomatic alternative. Their basic problem is that to be really helpful
                            to the Arabs they would have to provide effective military support. But
                            this, they fear, could lead to confrontation with us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s response points up the
                            Soviet dilemma but does not provide new evidence of their intentions.
                            They are not anxious for a confrontation with us over the Middle East
                            even though <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s letter
                            itself injected strong elements of confrontation. But they are under
                            increasing pressure to do something for <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> and may already have made some new commitment to
                            him, at least to increase the pressures on the U.S. and Israel. Their
                            immediate aim may be to force the Israelis, <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407"
                                facs="0440"/>through us, to cease the air attacks on the Egyptian
                            heartland. Failing that, they seem to be preserving the option of
                            offering some new movement in the Four Power or even the Two Power talks
                            which might persuade us to hold off on arms deliveries to Israel, or—if
                            that doesn't seem feasible or attractive—involving themselves more
                            directly in the defense of the UAR. We cannot be sure that the Soviets
                            have irrevocably decided to come to <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s aid with more and improved weapons and/or
                            direct involvement of their own people in the hostilities. On the other
                            hand, the present diplomatic exchange could be mainly for the record and
                            to justify such a move.</p>
                        <p>In short, the Soviets continue to walk on a dangerous tightrope and seem
                            not yet to have decided on a definite course. All that seems clear is
                            that at least on the surface they have left the most important options
                            open, while trying to force the Israelis to call off their attacks and
                            prevent us from sending more Phantoms. The tough and dangerous
                            decisions—whether and how to bail out the Egyptians or whether and how

                            <item>It was plainly the view of the Soviet delegation at Helsinki that
                                the first round of talks was to be no more than preliminary and <pb

                                Soviets were also intent on demonstrating by their demeanor—the
                                avoidance of propagandistic or tendentious debating tactics—that
                                Moscow was ready for a serious exploration of the prospects for
                                strategic arms control. They wanted, in return, renewed evidence of
                                American “seriousness.”</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The essential test of this seriousness, in the Russian view, is
                                whether the US is ready to acknowledge that it does not think of
                                itself as bargaining from a position of strategic superiority and
                                will treat with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as an
                                equal. Thus, at Helsinki, the Soviets tried to satisfy themselves
                                that the US did not aim to use the talks as a lever to obtain
                                concessions from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on other
                                international issues; among other reasons, because they did not want
                                the impression to be left that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> needed arms control more than the US did. So too,
                                the Soviets insisted that an arms control agreement must assure
                                “equal security” for both sides and not give a military advantage to
                                either.</item>

                            <item>Other than to carry out this kind of broad reconnaissance of US
                                intentions, the instructions of the Soviet delegation at Helsinki
                                seemed to call generally for letting the US take the lead in opening
                                substantive issues. The Soviets were quick, however, to endorse
                                certain broad propositions which the US put forward as essential
                                premises for an agreement. Thus, they affirmed that they understood
                                mutual deterrence to be the governing principle of the US-Soviet
                                strategic relationship. And they recognized officially for the first
                                time the interrelationship between offensive and defensive strategic
                                systems and acknowledged that defensive, as well as offensive,
                                systems can pose a threat to stability.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Generally, on broad concepts underlying the problems at issue the
                                Soviets demonstrated sophistication; this was apparently intended to
                                show their seriousness as well as to assert their claim to equality.
                                Insofar as the Soviet statements approached more concrete issues,
                                they reflected primarily a concern to lay the groundwork, at least
                                for bargaining purposes, for definitions which would include or
                                exclude weapon systems to the Soviet advantage. But it did not
                                appear that the Soviets had even in their own minds a fully coherent
                                view of the various elements which might go into an eventual
                                agreement, and some of their points were made as a response to an
                                illustrative negotiating outline offered by the US.</item>

                            <item>Moscow's willingness to move on to a second round of talks
                                indicates that it found US motives in <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                    >SALT</gloss> to be sufficiently “serious.” No doubt some in the
                                Soviet leadership were already persuaded of this, but others
                                probably argued that the results of Helsinki should be awaited. In
                                any case, it appears that Moscow was uncertain until the discussions
                                were nearly ended whether they had gone well enough to warrant the
                                conclusion that a second phase would have reasonable chances of
                                success from the Soviet point of view. The decision to go ahead only
                                    <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0442"/>after a four-month
                                interval may have been due to foot-dragging by some elements in
                                Moscow, though it could equally have resulted from recognition that
                                much more elaborate preparation would be needed than had been
                                thought.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Probably the Soviets left Helsinki without a clear understanding
                                of the shape and content of an agreement at which the US might be
                                aiming. That the US presented categories and definitions which the
                                Soviets took to be self-serving presumably did not disturb them
                                greatly, though they probably came away uncertain as to how flexible
                                the US would be in this regard. Some features of the US presentation
                                may have genuinely puzzled them, notably the tentative approach to
                                the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> problem and the mention of
                                    <gloss target="#t_MIRV1">MIRV</gloss> only in passing, as part
                                of a list of component parts of missile systems. They may still be
                                uncertain concerning the degree to which the “illustrative elements”
                                outlined to them actually represented an initial US negotiating
                                position. They are also probably confused concerning the extent to
                                which the US intends to press for qualitative as well as
                                quantitative limitations.</item>
                            <label>7.</label>
                            <item>In particular, the Soviets are probably uncertain as to how
                                comprehensive and complex an agreement the US will eventually seek.
                                Even in a fairly simple agreement, the standards of equivalence will
                                be difficult to establish, due to asymmetries in the structure of
                                strategic forces—a fact that both sides acknowledged at Helsinki.
                                And the Soviets are probably not sure whether the US will be
                                satisfied to rely for verification on national means only.
                                Nevertheless, they have probably concluded tentatively that the US
                                approach did not disclose any insuperable obstacles to an eventual
                                agreement and that the chances of working out an agreement

                                    >SALT</gloss>. Nevertheless, it strongly suggests that Moscow is

                                strategic arms competition can be contained, through <gloss

                                interest in exploring this avenue seems to rest, in the first place,
                                on its perception of the present state of the strategic relationship
                                with the US. Economic considerations also bear on the Soviet
                                attitude toward <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, as do certain
                                Soviet foreign policy concerns, e.g., Western Europe, <gloss

                                have no way of knowing with certainty whether the Soviet leaders

                                they do, whether they also think that long-term stabilization of
                                this relationship is desirable or even possible. It may be that the
                                decision-making apparatus in Moscow has not come to a firm consensus
                                on such questions. There is agreement in Moscow, of course, that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> must have rough parity at

                                think, however, that as the Soviet leaders now see the future they

                                        US toward decreasing military expenditures. A judgment as to
                                        whether the Soviets would consider feasible the attainment
                                        of clear and decisive superiority must be addressed in the
                                        context of past Soviet decisions. The Soviets mounted an
                                        enormous effort to develop and deploy strategic military
                                        nuclear systems (ICBMs, SLBMs, aircraft, and <gloss

                                        numbers and weapon yield and to achieve an initial advantage
                                        in <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> capability. While the
                                        decision to catch up posed a severe technological and
                                        economic challenge to the Soviets, they accepted the
                                        challenge and have now achieved at least parity. At the same
                                        time, they have continued to greatly expand their military
                                        research programs, have continued to develop new
                                        systems—such as fractional orbit and depressed trajectory
                                        missiles—and have continued the pace of their deployment of
                                        strategic systems. Therefore, in reviewing past Soviet
                                        achievements and weighing their present and future actions,
                                        there is no evidence to support a view that the Soviets will
                                        ignore an opportunity to forge ahead. The goal may now seem
                                        to them closer at hand than it was 10 years ago. The
                                        resources in terms of technical and scientific personnel,
                                        production capacity, and internal political control are
                                        available to motivate and facilitate a Soviet decision to
                                        achieve clear and decisive strategic superiority. [Footnote

                                procedure will presumably be maintained through the Vienna phase.
                                The Politburo's watchfulness is not surprising, given not only the
                                inherent significance of the issues but also the possible domestic
                                effects of the decisions to be made and their implications for

                                    it—undoubtedly has serious reservations about strategic arms
                                    limitations. But some of the military leaders have long resisted
                                    the high priority given to strategic weapons at the expense of
                                    the traditional arms of service. In recent years, the
                                    militarization of the Sino-Soviet dispute has greatly enlarged
                                    requirements for general purpose forces. Moreover, some military
                                    writers see in the nuclear stalemate a need to improve
                                    capabilities for conventional warfare, especially in view of
                                        <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s adoption of a
                                    strategy of “flexible response.” An arms limitation agreement
                                    which freed resources to meet these requirements would surely be
                                    welcome in some military quarters. Thus, the political
                                    leadership will probably not receive uniform advice from the
                                    military establishment as the negotiations develop.</p>

                                stabilization. Long-held premises about the inevitability of
                                conflict, mistrust of American motives, fear of being duped, even
                                ignorance of the relevant technical facts would help to sustain such
                                attitudes. And it is true that conservative instincts seem to be

                            <item>On the other hand, there are obviously a number of people,
                                including some military men, who have the ear of the leadership and
                                will be able to make a strong case for a serious try at
                                stabilization by agreement. The argument for easing economic
                                pressures is a strong one, particularly for those who want more
                                margin to experiment with economic reform. It will be said that as
                                the arms race enters a new technological phase Soviet chances of
                                lagging seriously behind are high. Some will argue that at present
                                levels of strength strategic weapons are no longer as critical to
                                the power competition, that, in fact, if the strategic arms race can
                                be contained by agreement, other factors, including conventional
                                military power, could be enhanced and would better serve the

                            <item>We see no way of forecasting how such arguments will net out.

                            <item>Over the last 15 years, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                has established itself as a major power factor in the Mediterranean
                                world. By exploiting postcolonial resentments and especially the
                                Arab-Israeli conflict, the Soviets have sought to deny the area to
                                Western interests and influence. Their calculation has been that the
                                displacement of Western with Soviet influence would constitute a
                                broad strategic reversal for the West and a considerable gain for
                                themselves. Nevertheless, they have not seen the area as one which
                                engaged their most vital national interests; these remain focused on
                                their relations with the US in general, on Eastern and Central
                                Europe, and on their conflict with Communist China.</item>

                            <item>The Arab-Israeli conflict provides the Soviets with their greatest
                                means of leverage in the Middle East, but it also faces them with
                                the most severe complications. They have extended enough military
                                aid to the radical Arabs to become thoroughly involved in the
                                latter's cause, but their efforts have not created an effective Arab
                                defense. Israeli military attacks, particularly against Egypt,
                                intensify this Soviet dilemma. They wish to provide Egypt with
                                effective defense, but seek also to minimize the risks of direct
                                involvement; yet if they sought to defuse the situation by pressing
                                the Arabs to make concessions to Israel, they would jeopardize their
                                influence in the Arab world. Barring a de-escalation of the
                                Arab-Israeli conflict, the Soviets will probably step up their aid
                                to the Egyptians, and they may provide new weapons systems and
                                additional personnel to improve Egyptian air defenses.</item>

                            <item>Despite the Soviet support for the Arab cause in the Arab-Israeli
                                conflict, Moscow's relations with the radical Arab states are
                                subject to occasionally serious strains; none of these countries is

                                The still more uncontrollable fedayeen movement is a problem for
                                Moscow, chiefly because any direct Soviet support for it involves
                                embarrassment in Moscow's relations with established governments;
                                nevertheless, we think the Soviets will continue to develop
                                relations with the fedayeen discreetly.</item>

                                immediate neighbors and to France. Although the new regime in Libya
                                has close ties with Egypt, it shows no signs of welcoming a Soviet
                                presence, and <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> is
                                probably not anxious to encourage Soviet influence there. Among
                                European states with interests in the area, Moscow must be concerned
                                to avoid provoking alarm by its activities in the Mediterranean lest

                                in the area: roughly 5,000 Soviet military advisers are now
                                stationed in several area countries; the Soviet naval squadron in

                        <p>1. Soviet power first moved into the Mediterranean in the mid1950s.
                            Seizing on the opportunities for influence offered by Arab-Israeli
                            antagonisms and by increasingly militant and anti-Western forms of Arab
                            nationalism, and leap-frogging over the Middle Eastern members of the
                            newly formed Baghdad Pact (Turkey, Iran, and Iraq), the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> eased its way into both Cairo and
                            Damascus with offers of arms, economic aid, and political support.
                            During the 1960s, through <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0449"/>the
                            use of these and other conventional instruments of influence and power,
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> became the primary backer of
                            the radical Arab states. Today the Soviet Union is a major factor in the
                            Middle East, with a number of client states in varying degrees of
                            dependency and with elements of its own armed forces now present in the
                            area. The Soviet leadership almost certainly sees its gains here as the
                            most extensive and successful of all its efforts to expand Soviet
                            influence in areas of the world once dominated by the West.</p>
                        <p>2. Clearly, the Soviets have in this period looked upon the Middle East
                            as an area of strategic importance. A part of this attitude no doubt was
                            inherited from their predecessors; Czarist planners traditionally viewed
                            this part of the world as a special Russian sphere of interest and
                            periodically sought to expand Russian power southwards. In modern times,
                            especially since the death of Stalin, this geopolitical emphasis has
                            been accompanied by an ideologically inspired hope that the
                            anticolonialist attitudes of the Third World could be made to work for
                            social change and for the emergence of local power elites sympathetic to
                            communism. And this has been joined with the view that the Middle East
                            has become one of the main arenas of the Soviet struggle with the West
                            and the US. The Soviets may see the area as more complicated and the
                            opportunities less immediate than they did in 1955 when they first
                            undertook a military supply program for Egypt. But they evidently still
                            hope to bring the states of the region into an anti-Western alignment
                            and ultimately to establish their own hegemony there. Finally, the area
                            is seen in Moscow as a strategic military zone: in hostile hands, it
                            could pose a threat to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            block Soviet access to the Mediterranean; in friendly hands, it protects
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s southwestern border and
                            permits Moscow to move its influence into the Mediterranean world and
                            beyond. The Middle East and much of the non-European Mediterranean world
                            are thus, in the Soviet world view, proximate, important, and
                            vulnerable.</p>
                        <p>3. This is not to say that the Soviets attach the same weight to their
                            problems and objectives in the Middle East and Mediterranean basin as
                            they do to their prime concerns elsewhere. Their stake there is less
                            critical to their interests than their relations with the US in general,
                            their concerns in Eastern and Central Europe, and their conflict with
                            Communist China. It is in these areas and with these countries that the
                            most vital of Soviet national interests are directly engaged. There are
                            in addition certain self-imposed limitations on Soviet policies in the
                            Mediterranean area and the Middle East. The preservation of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s position in the Middle East would
                            not be worth the serious risk of nuclear war with the US, whereas its
                            presence in, say, East Germany, might be. But at least until recently
                            Moscow has been able to base its approach in the Mediterranean area on
                            calculations of opportunity and risk within the area concerned without
                            serious conflicts with its objectives elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>4. Inevitably, as the degree of its involvement in the area has grown and
                            the level of its commitment risen, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> has found itself faced with mounting costs and risks.
                            It has exhibited some anxiety to control these risks and to curb the
                            excessive enthusiasms of some of its clients. But it has also chosen to
                            live with danger, and its position is now potentially vulnerable to the
                            pressures and perils of events over which it may have little or no
                            control—the actions of the Arab states, of Israel, and even of the US.
                            Broadly speaking, Moscow has behaved as if it wishes the Middle East to
                            remain an area of at least some tension. It apparently believes that the
                            risks attending this are manageable, and that continued polarization in
                            the area will make it increasingly difficult for the conservative Arab
                            states to maintain their ties with the US, thus decreasing US influence
                            throughout the area. But the Soviets clearly recognize that in the event
                            of another explosion in the Middle East they would be faced with some
                            very hard choices.</p>

                        <p>5. In moving into the Mediterranean, the Soviets have used the
                            conventional instruments of power available, short of the actual use of

                            countries. Egypt, with over $1.4 billion in aid, is by far the largest
                            beneficiary. Iraq and Syria have also become almost wholly dependent on

                                in the source text. The appendix is not printed.]</note> Since 1957,
                            the Soviets have committed at least $2.6 billion of economic aid to
                            Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Algeria, and Syria (in that <pb n="418"

                            economic aid commitments to all non-Communist countries. These programs
                            serve different policy aims in different countries. In the case of
                            Egypt, for example, the aim is to assist the development of the leading
                            Arab nation as a Soviet client, and to reinforce the overall pattern of
                            dependency on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; with Iran,
                            there is a solid economic basis for expanded relations as well as the

                            Though in other areas of the world Moscow is becoming more selective and
                            tough-minded, the policy of economic assistance in the Middle East and
                            the Mediterranean area is likely to continue on a substantial scale for
                            the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Other Economic Interests</hi>. Economic interests
                            play a role in Soviet policy, but not a decisive one. The Soviets want
                            to maintain access to the waterways of the area; over half the Soviet
                            merchant marine tonnage is based in Black Sea ports. Continued closure
                            of the Suez Canal increases the cost of Soviet shipping east of Africa,
                            but Moscow has learned to live with this situation, however unhappily.
                            The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also has some interest in
                            Middle Eastern oil and gas, both for itself and for the countries of
                            Eastern Europe. Although Soviet supplies of petroleum appear adequate
                            for domestic consumption and substantial exports for many years to come,
                            East European and Soviet imports from the Middle East would release
                            corresponding quantities of Soviet oil and gas for additional sales in
                            hard currency markets. But Communist imports are likely to remain a
                            small proportion of Middle East oil sales, and such imports would be
                            further limited by the desire of the producing states to sell elsewhere
                            for hard currencies.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">The Soviet Military Presence</hi>. The Soviets have
                            substantially increased their military presence in the eastern
                            Mediterranean since the June War. The number of military advisers
                            attached to Arab forces has been greatly increased and the Soviet naval
                            squadron has been strengthened. The squadron's political objectives
                            apparently are to show the flag, to demonstrate support of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s allies in the area, and to reveal
                            to the world that the Mediterranean Sea is no longer an exclusive
                            preserve of the US Sixth Fleet. Its primary military roles are to
                            monitor the Sixth Fleet, to complicate and inhibit its operations even
                            in peace time, to develop capabilities against Polaris submarines and,
                            in the event of hostilities, to attempt to deny Western naval forces the
                            use of Mediterranean waters. Currently, the Soviet naval units also seem
                            to have some effect in deterring Israeli attacks on Egyptian ports.</p>
                        <p>10. From the few surface ships and submarines deployed in 1964, the
                            Soviet Mediterranean squadron has since grown to become the largest
                            Soviet naval force outside home fleet operating areas. Except for
                            occasional peaks, the Soviet squadron usually consists of about <pb
                                n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0452"/>12 surface combatants, 2 or 3
                            landing ships, and 8 to 10 diesel and nuclear-powered submarines.
                            Normally, between 12 and 15 auxiliary ships provide logistic support and
                            1 to 3 are intelligence ships. Normally, 2 to 4 of the surface
                            combatants are equipped with surface-to-air or surface-to-surface
                            missiles, and 1 or 2 of the submarines are nuclear-powered. In addition,
                            6 Soviet naval reconnaissance aircraft (TU–16s), and 3 antisubmarine
                            warfare (ASW) amphibian aircraft operate from Egyptian air bases in
                            support of the squadron.</p>
                        <p>11. We estimate that the Soviets have roughly 5,000 military advisers
                            stationed in the area—about 3,000 in Egypt, 1,200 in Algeria, 500 in
                            Syria, a few hundred in Iraq, and lesser numbers in the Sudan, Yemen,
                            and South Yemen. Although these advisers are not known to have command
                            authority, in Egypt and Syria they occupy important advisory positions
                            at or near command levels, and are present with units down to
                            battalion/squadron level.</p>
                        <p>12. Since the June War the Soviets have concluded a number of “facilities
                            arrangements” with Egypt which permit the Soviet naval squadron to make
                            regular use of repair facilities in Alexandria and of storage facilities
                            there and in Port Said. We have no evidence of any such approach to
                            Syria. The Soviets would probably like to have similar facilities in the
                            western Mediterranean. They apparently sought such arrangements with
                            Algeria, but have been rebuffed. In fact, the Algerians have recently
                            called for the withdrawal from the Mediterranean of the fleets of all
                            non-riparian powers.</p>
                        <p>13. Soviet naval units, both surface and submarine, use the Egyptian
                            facilities throughout the year; both surface vessels and submarines are
                            at times supplied and repaired by Soviet tenders which remain on station
                            in Alexandria. While not bases in the conventional sense—the Egyptians
                            evidently retain formal control—these facilities do provide support
                            services in much the same way. But in case of a major East-West crisis
                            the availability of these facilities to the Soviets might be uncertain
                            and would depend to an important degree on the circumstances of the
                            crises.</p>
                        <p>14. For purposes of refueling and resupply, the Soviet Mediterranean
                            squadron relies primarily on 12 naval anchorages (most in international
                            waters). It uses Egyptian shore facilities more on a basis of
                            convenience than actual need, though these do enable it to extend the
                            length of time its diesel submarines remain in the Mediterranean from
                            two months to six. We believe that the Soviets would be reluctant to
                            undercut their anti-imperialist propaganda by seeking to establish bases
                            of their own in Arab lands. And even the radical Arab governments would
                            want to avoid the stigma of such bases (though Egypt no doubt derives
                            some comfort from the presence of Soviet naval vessels as deterrents to
                            Israeli action).</p>

                        <p>15. The evident damage done to Soviet standing in Arab eyes during the
                            June War has since been repaired and the Soviet position strengthened.
                            Moscow has established itself even more firmly as the champion of the
                            radical Arabs, thus gaining an enlarged presence, a degree of Arab
                            support for Soviet policies elsewhere, and a major voice in
                            international negotiations concerning the area. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has achieved this position at a
                            price, not only in terms of the hardware involved in resupplying the
                            Arabs but also in terms of the strains created by the increasingly
                            critical Arab-Israeli conflict and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>'s inability to produce either an acceptable solution
                            or adequate protection for its clients. But these strains are not likely
                            to undermine Soviet influence seriously so long as the Arabs have no
                            alternative sources of great power support against Israel and continue
                            to regard the US as committed to Israel's cause. In any case, the
                            patron-client relationship involves a degree of Arab leverage over the
                            Soviets as well as vice versa. For, in the Arab-Israeli conflict, the
                            Soviets are more a prisoner of Arab emotions than the architect of Arab
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>16. The Soviets have not, however, harnessed themselves to the more
                            extreme aims of the Arabs toward Israel, and it is unlikely they will do
                            so. Moscow continues to accept the legitimacy of Israel's statehood and
                            Soviet diplomatic activity proceeds from the premise that a negotiated
                            settlement should give Israel security. Yet the Russians recognize that
                            in order to maintain their position with the Arabs they must maintain a
                            generally hostile posture vis-à-vis Israel and broadcast their firm
                            opposition to Israel's policies.</p>
                        <p>17. There has clearly been a large element of temporizing in the <gloss

                            negotiations on the Arab-Israeli question. It has sought through talks
                            with the US and others to influence US policy in the area and to
                            demonstrate to the world at large that the Soviet interest is in peace.
                            The Soviets place a high value on their brokerage function; they would
                            be extremely displeased if, for example, Egypt sought to by-pass them in
                            any serious negotiations on the future of the area. But it seems certain
                            that the Soviets are not ready at this time to urge on their Arab
                            clients the kind of concessions which might open up the possibility of a
                            genuine settlement.</p>
                        <p>18. This does not rule out the possibility of Soviet support at some
                            point for steps toward a modus vivendi to defuse the situation. In
                            certain circumstances, the Soviets might actively seek an arrangement
                            which would diminish the dangers of renewed hostilities while still
                            allowing them to enjoy the fruits of continued Arab-Israeli tension.
                            Even here, however, Moscow must be concerned not only with the terms of
                            the arrangement but with the Arab reactions to them. In any case, <pb
                                n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0454"/>Moscow is not likely to put
                            very heavy pressure on the Arabs—such as a threat to suspend all arms
                            aid—in order to bring about a modus vivendi.</p>
                        <p>19. The Soviets probably will be inclined to stay with a policy which
                            will bend with events, hoping by it to avoid being drawn into conflict,
                            while reinforcing their political and military presence in the area. It
                            may be, however, that events—with an assist from the Israelis—will not
                            permit the Soviets to maintain so comfortable and rewarding a course.
                            Indeed, aggressive Israeli policies against Egypt point up a sharpening
                            Soviet dilemma: whether to seek to preserve the <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> regime by giving it a new level
                            of support—thus increasing the risk of direct Soviet involvement—or
                            alternatively, to press the Arabs toward a distasteful
                            accommodation—thus risking a loss of influence in the Arab world.<note

                        <p>20. Soviet calculations have certainly taken into account that Israel has
                            the capability to develop and produce, and might soon be in a position
                            to deploy, nuclear weapons. The Soviets probably believe that such
                            weapons would be chiefly useful to Israel as a deterrent against Arab
                            invasion—something not likely to be attempted at any early date. Hence,
                            while the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would take advantage of
                            any Israeli nuclear weapons to mount a political campaign against Israel
                            and to emphasize Arab dependence on the Soviets, it would probably not
                            take seriously the possibility of their actual use unless Israel faced a
                            desperate situation. Even in such circumstances, although Soviets have
                            the capability to deploy nuclear weapons under their control on Egyptian
                            territory, we think it highly unlikely that they would do so even under
                            heavy Arab pressure. They would be more likely to threaten Israel from
                            their own territory or from their ships in the Mediterranean.</p>

                        <p>21. The degree of Soviet influence over individual Arab states varies—and
                            will continue to vary—considerably; it is probably highest in Egypt and
                            nil in Saudi Arabia. Among the revolutionary states, Syria, Iraq, and
                            South Yemen would be more susceptible to Soviet urging or advice than
                            Algeria and Yemen. Kuwait, Lebanon, and Jordan are not anxious to
                            cooperate with the Soviets but try to maintain good relations.</p>
                        <p>22. In Egypt, Moscow can influence the government's attitudes on a
                            variety of external questions and can expect to play some role in the
                            formulation of Egyptian economic and military policies. There is a great
                                <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0455"/>deal, however, that the
                            Soviets almost certainly <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> do in Egypt. They
                            cannot guarantee that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> will
                            remain in power; his fate will depend on his health and on his own
                            political skills. They cannot dictate the choice of his successor since
                            they lack either a strong political organization within Egypt or a
                            candidate for the succession whom they could cultivate without
                            alienating <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> himself. And,
                            in the last analysis, they cannot control Cairo's behavior on questions
                            the Egyptians consider vital.</p>
                        <p>23. If Soviet influence over Egypt has its limitations, these are even
                            more marked elsewhere in the Arab world. Ideologically, the regime in
                            Syria has a good deal in common with Moscow, and it is almost wholly
                            dependent on the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for military
                            equipment. Offsetting this, however, are several negative factors.
                            Syrian nationalism is xenophobic. Of the Arab states bordering Israel,
                            Syria is the most intransigent, rejecting all efforts toward a political
                            settlement and encouraging a “war of national liberation.” Moreover,
                            Syria is dominated by a frequently changing coterie of military men;
                            close Soviet relations with today's leaders carry the risk of offending
                            those of tomorrow. The latter consideration also applies to Iraq. In
                            Jordan, the Soviets have had little success in expanding their influence
                            since Hussein has so far chosen to deal with the Western powers which
                            have long supported his regime and supplied his army. Soviet prospects
                            would presumably improve if Jordan accepted Soviet arms or if the
                            fedayeen came to dominate the regime.</p>
                        <p>24. Despite the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s extensive
                            influence in some Arab capitals, the fortunes of individual governments
                            in the Arab world are largely beyond Moscow's ability to control. The
                            Soviets cannot guarantee a regime's survival, nor can they be assured of
                            success should they seek to bring one down. The Soviets will thus
                            probably stand aside in the event of important disruptions, moving in to
                            attempt to capitalize on events as the dust settles. Though surely
                            concerned about the uncertainties which would flow from <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s removal, and though they would
                            seek to forestall such an eventuality, active Soviet intervention on
                            behalf of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> would be
                            unlikely. Revolutions in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, or Kuwait might be
                            cheered by the Soviets, but could not now be inspired by them.</p>
                        <p>25. There are still further complications in Soviet dealings with the
                            Arab world. The trade of most of the states of the area is still heavily
                            oriented toward the West.<note n="5" xml:id="d138fn5">See Appendix,

                            their hostility to Israel, the governments of Egypt, Syria, and Iraq
                            profoundly dislike and distrust one another. They are actively
                            competitive in inter-Arab affairs, and Soviet policies concerning one
                            may seriously complicate policies toward another.</p>

                        <p>26. The Soviets have for the most part limited their dealings and their
                            material support to existing governments, but there have been
                            exceptions. Thus, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> provided
                            arms and diplomatic support to the FLN during the Algerian revolution;
                            it has consistently championed a special status for the Kurds in Iraq;
                            it has also tried (though modestly) to promote the fortunes of Communist
                            parties in such countries as Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
                        <p>27. With the fedayeen, the Soviets have dealt cautiously, mostly through
                            intermediaries. This is partly because of the fedayeen's penchant for
                            free-wheeling militancy, which Moscow cannot hope to control, and partly
                            because of its reluctance to get involved in rivalries between them and
                            governments of the area. Yet the Soviets now appear to believe that
                            dealing with the fedayeen exclusively through the medium of Arab
                            governments will no longer suffice in the face of an emerging sense of a
                            Palestinian identity. Peking's vocal support of fedayeen extremism adds
                            to Soviet inducements to keep lines out to these movements. Although a
                            Fatah delegation has been in Moscow recently, the visit was unofficial,
                            and arms to the fedayeen probably will continue to be channeled through
                            area governments. Soviet support for the fedayeen will continue to be
                            discreet, in an effort to avoid antagonizing Arab governments.</p>

                        <p>28. Concerning Israel itself, Moscow does not have full mastery over its
                            own policies. It is obliged by its relations with the radical Arabs, in
                            fact, to maintain a hostile attitude. This is made easier by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s unremitting opposition to
                            “Zionism,” which the Soviet leaders see as an internal security problem
                            in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe. As
                            noted, Soviet policy does not seek the destruction of Israel. Not only
                            would this remove the Soviets' principal leverage on the Arabs; Moscow
                            also recognizes that Western military and political support makes Israel
                            a factor with which the Soviets must contend.</p>

                            legacy of the period when it posed an active threat to all three. Soviet
                            ambitions in these states are curbed by the membership of all three in
                            US-supported alliance systems and, in general, by the anti-Communist
                            convictions of all three governments. Nonetheless, Soviet relations with
                            these states have improved as a consequence of a major Soviet
                            effort—begun almost a decade ago—to recast its image into that of a
                            peace-loving and benevolent neighbor. <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424"

                        <p>30. Economically, at least, Iran has gone the furthest in response; it
                            has contracted for at least $115 million worth of Soviet arms, and a
                            Soviet sponsored 650 mile pipeline—now nearing completion—will bring
                            over $60 million worth of natural gas annually from the Persian Gulf to
                            the Soviet Caucasus. Turkey has accepted some Soviet economic aid and
                            seeks to avoid antagonism in the relationship, but the climate between
                            the two countries is certainly not warm. Greece under the junta is
                            vigorously anti-Communist, and trade will probably remain the most
                            significant contact with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                            Moscow probably expects at least Turkey and Iran to draw farther away
                            from the US and hopes to benefit from such movement. But the chances for
                            a significant increase in Soviet influence in these three countries will
                            be limited for some time to come.</p>

                            circumstances shape the politics of the area in ways not wholly
                            congenial to Soviet interests. First, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have
                            had long associations with France which have shaped their cultures,

                            the west Arab states, their government leaders are less willing than the
                            eastern Arabs to accept <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            leadership, less dependent on Soviet support, and more suspicious of the
                            policies and motives of both <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"

                        <p>32. Recent developments in North Africa pose further obstacles to the
                            growth of Soviet influence there. Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco are
                            patching up old quarrels which for a time contributed to Algeria's
                            desire for Soviet support. These states are, in addition, moving
                            somewhat closer to France as a result of French efforts to improve
                            relations. Moreover, in the wake of the Libyan coup, concern over the
                            westward extension of <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s
                            influence has grown in all three countries. Their tendency to draw
                            together may in time produce a sense of community divergent from that of
                            the eastern Arab nations.<note n="7" xml:id="d138fn7">

                        <p>33. Algeria is more revolutionary, more anticolonialist, and more anti-US
                            than Morocco and Tunisia. It is thus easier for the Algerians to find a
                            common cause with both the Egyptians and the Soviets. The Algerians have
                            received substantial amounts of Soviet arms and military training
                            assistance as well as Soviet support in a variety of economic
                            development projects. But they have not allowed the Soviets to influence
                            their domestic affairs, to interfere with their relationship with
                            France, to reorient the great bulk of their trade away from Western
                            Europe, or to guide the course of Algerian foreign policy in general.
                            There has also been recent evidence of frictions in Soviet-Algerian
                            relations. Algeria has views on some international issues which coincide
                            with those of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; yet it is not a
                            client state, nor is it likely to become one.</p>
                        <p>34. Libya's military junta is unsure of its internal position and
                            uncertain about both domestic and foreign policies. The junta, or at
                            least its head, Colonel Qaddafi, has sought and received support—1,500
                            troops and several hundred technicians and advisers, as well as public
                            backing—from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The latter
                            no doubt welcomes the chance to extend his own direct influence into
                            Libya, and he would be disinclined to see this eroded by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s playing a major role there. The
                            Libyan regime, perhaps at Cairo's urging, has several times rebuffed
                            Soviet diplomatic overtures and Soviet offers of arms; it apparently
                            prefers to buy from France and other Western suppliers. At least as long
                            as the present junta stays in power, we think it unlikely that the
                            Soviets will gain significant influence in Libya.</p>
                        <p>35. This is not to say that Libya lacks attraction for the Soviets. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s Egyptian-marked
                            reconnaissance aircraft flying from Egypt can cover the Mediterranean as
                            far west as Sardinia. The use of Wheelus airfield in Libya would extend
                            the range of TU–16 reconnaissance aircraft beyond Gibraltar. Moscow
                            might thus seek to pressure <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> into exerting his influence on the Libyan junta
                            to provide these facilities for Soviet use. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> would be reluctant to do so, but he is deeply
                            beholden to the Soviets, and it is possible that he might agree to some
                            such arrangement—and the Libyans reluctantly acquiesce in it—if Soviet
                            pressures were severe. Even in these circumstances, Soviet use of Libyan
                            facilities would probably be limited and covert. Only a very small
                            Soviet presence would be required, especially if Soviet activities were
                            confined to refueling.</p>
                        <p>36. Malta is also attractive to Soviet planners inasmuch as its location
                            is strategic and its economy faltering. If Malta is unable to strengthen
                            its economy through assistance from the West, it may turn to the Soviets
                            for aid. Overtures have been made by the Soviets, but thus far Soviet
                            fleet visits have been denied and Soviet offers to provide economic
                            assistance have been declined. Elections must be held by March 1971; a
                            change in government could pave the way for closer <pb n="426"
                                xml:id="pg_426" facs="0459"/>association with the Soviets. Although
                            the Soviets may seek limited facilities in Algeria, Libya, and Malta
                            through which to stage their reconnaissance aircraft, none of these
                            countries is likely to extend such facilities at this time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">European States</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>37. In Western Europe, Soviet policy aims currently at promoting an
                            atmosphere of détente and ultimately at reducing the US presence on the
                            continent. Moscow will not wish to jeopardize these objectives by
                            initiatives in the Mediterranean which would alarm the countries of
                            Western Europe. It probably calculates that moves which seemed to
                            threaten to cut off Western Europe from the Arab countries and their oil
                            would stiffen the Western posture toward the Soviets—both in the
                            Mediterranean and in Europe itself—and help consolidate ties between
                            Western Europe and the US.</p>
                        <p>38. In fact, there are now signs of some change in European attitudes—a
                            gradual increase in concern over the growing Soviet presence in the
                            Mediterranean. No general alarms have yet been sounded, nor does there
                            appear to have been any significant political pressure for changes in
                            overall policies toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But
                            concern is increasing in West European military circles and this has
                            been reflected in specific countermeasures under <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> auspices, such as the establishment
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> machinery to monitor the
                            activities of the Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>39. France, which has strong interests in certain Arab states, has been
                            the most active of the West European states in the Mediterranean. In
                            recent months Pompidou has sought to enhance France's position as a
                            Mediterranean power by improving relations and influence with countries
                            on both shores of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Greece. The
                            Soviets have sought to take advantage of this policy, specifically of
                            French support of the Arabs in their contest with Israel. But while
                            Moscow has tried to use France to divide the Western powers—as in the
                            Four Power talks on a Middle East settlement—the Soviets must also be
                            concerned that the French are their rivals. The sale of French arms to
                            Libya, for example, may have deprived the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> of an opportunity to sell its own weapons to that
                            country and prevented it from extending its influence over the Libyan
                            junta. Similarly, France's efforts in North Africa will help to counter
                            Soviet influence in Algeria and to block it in Morocco and Tunisia.</p>

                        <p>40. The enlarged Soviet military presence in the Mediterranean area has
                            substantially increased Soviet influence and required all interested
                            states, including the US, to take account of Soviet attitudes and
                            possible actions. How and in what circumstances the Soviets might <pb

                            The paragraphs which follow examine possible Soviet actions and
                            capabilities in four major contingencies: (a) Arab-Israeli hostilities
                            short of a full-scale conflict, i.e., the present situation; (b) all-out
                            Arab-Israeli war; (c) other area disputes in which Soviet interests were
                            involved; and (d) East-West hostilities.</p>

                        <p>41. The current success of Israeli military activities against the Arab
                            states has no doubt added to Soviet disillusionment with the Arabs'
                            ability to use modern equipment effectively. At the same time, Israeli
                            activities increase Arab pressures on the Soviets for more advanced
                            types of equipment. The Soviets have turned down a number of Arab
                            requests in the past and have to date carefully limited both the
                            quantity and quality of arms shipments, partly because of the Arabs'
                            limited ability to absorb such matériel. They are in the awkward
                            position of having provided enough to be thoroughly involved, but of not
                            having supplied support of a kind or nature to do a successful job of
                            defending Egypt. Appeals from Cairo for additional help have become more
                            urgent as Israeli raids have intensified.</p>
                        <p>42. Moscow is clearly aware that greater direct involvement entails
                            heightened risks. It must be concerned that substantially greater
                            assistance to the Arabs would not satisfy them but only stimulate
                            demands for even greater Soviet support in the future. Not only would
                            large-scale effort be very costly to the Soviets, but it would involve
                            such an enlarged Soviet presence as to change the character of the
                            Soviet-Egyptian relationship in ways that would raise problems for both
                            parties. Yet these hazards have to be weighed against alternatives which
                            may seem to the Soviets to be at least equally unpalatable. Certainly
                            Moscow does not like to see Cairo helpless in the face of Israeli air
                            assaults. Certainly it does not wish this sort of circumstance to weaken
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s position and
                            jeopardize domestic stability in the UAR. And certainly it would be
                            fearful that a refusal to aid the UAR in its hour of need would threaten
                            to disrupt relations with Egypt and damage Soviet prestige throughout
                            the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>43. We believe that the Soviets will decide, if they have not already
                            done so, that some sort of favorable response to Egyptian requests is
                            necessary unless Israeli attacks near Cairo are soon stopped. A decision
                            by the US to provide additional modern aircraft to Israel would make
                            such a Soviet response even more likely. But it will not suffice to
                            increase the flow of air defense equipment the Egyptians already have,
                            as the Soviets have recently done. The principal Egyptian problem is the
                            lack of certain more advanced weapons systems and above all of qualified
                            personnel to operate an integrated air defense system effectively. Hence
                            any significant improvement in Egyptian <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428"
                                facs="0461"/>defenses, at least in the short run, would almost
                            certainly require Soviet personnel to man the network.</p>
                        <p>44. Additional Soviet support for Egypt's air defense could be at various
                            levels. An integrated defense designed to protect the Cairo area might
                            involve providing advanced interceptors, several battalions of advanced
                            SA missiles, and additional antiaircraft artillery (AAA). Major elements
                            of such a system would have to be directed, operated, and maintained by
                            Soviet personnel, including pilots, for a considerable period, perhaps
                            indefinitely. The Soviets might hope that this system would deter
                            attacks on Cairo or subject the Israeli Air Force to unacceptable
                            losses. While this system would leave other prime areas open to attack,
                            the Soviets might calculate that it would suffice to serve <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s political needs.</p>
                        <p>45. If the Soviets felt that they had to provide protection for the bulk
                            of Egypt's population, industry, and military installations, they would
                            have to turn to more sophisticated equipment and establish air defense
                            coverage of the lower Nile valley and the Suez Canal area. Such a system
                            would require expanded early warning ground control intercept (EW/GCI)
                            radars, many more advanced interceptors, greater numbers of improved SA
                            missiles and additional AAA for key point defenses. To make the system
                            operational within a few months would require the introduction of entire
                            Soviet units involving many thousands of men.</p>
                        <p>46. The foregoing discussion of possible Soviet levels of support for
                            Egyptian air defense is only illustrative; a number of variations are
                            conceivable. The Soviets would of course strongly prefer to keep their
                            support at the lowest possible levels of risk and cost. In deciding what
                            levels of support would prove sufficient to their objectives, their
                            risk/advantage calculus would have to weigh possible Israeli responses
                            as well as <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s requirements.
                            In view of the stake the Soviets have in <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>'s survival, and in the preservation of their
                            relations with the radical Arabs, the Soviets may feel obliged to
                            enlarge their risks.</p>
                        <p>47. To deter Israeli raids the Soviets might consider deploying in Egypt
                            missiles with HE warheads capable of striking Israel proper. The
                            Soviets, however, would have to weigh the chances that such a deployment
                            would simply provoke the Israelis into larger attacks, perhaps on these
                            missile installations themselves. Moreover, the threat of indiscriminate
                            missile attacks on Israeli cities, let alone the actual delivery of such
                            attacks, would involve the Soviets in an undertaking repugnant to much
                            of world opinion, and one they would necessarily estimate would greatly
                            increase the chances of direct US involvement. For these reasons, we
                            think it highly unlikely that the Soviets would deploy such weapons.
                            Similarly, we think it virtually inconceivable that they would consider
                            deploying CW weapons there.</p>
                        <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>48. It might be that, coincident with moves for some form of greater
                            support in Egypt's defense, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            would put pressure on the Egyptians to agree to military or diplomatic
                            steps to defuse the present tension. Once Egypt's defenses seemed more
                            formidable, the Soviets might feel more free to encourage a cease-fire,
                            whether formal or tacit. They will probably continue to be unresponsive
                            to US appeals for a formal agreement to limit arms shipments to the
                            Middle East, but if the crisis continues to intensify, they might
                            tacitly consent to curb additional arms shipments to Egypt if the US
                            makes no additional aircraft sales to Israel.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Full-Scale Arab-Israeli War</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>49. Full-scale Arab-Israeli war could not be simply a replay of the 1967
                            war, if only because the Israelis now occupy extensive Arab territories.
                            Whatever the course of the military action, the Soviets would surely not
                            want to show themselves to be as helpless as they were in 1967. The
                            presence of numbers of Soviet advisers with Egyptian and Syrian troops
                            and of naval units in the area would make for a degree of involvement in
                            any case Whether the Soviets would consider intervening in a larger and
                            more overt way would presumably depend on the course and duration of the
                            war, and above all on their estimate of the US response.</p>
                        <p>50. Present Soviet capabilities to intervene in such a war with quick and
                            decisive effect are significant but not appreciably greater than they
                            were in June 1967. Although Egypt has made facilities available to the
                            Soviet squadron and to naval reconnaissance aircraft, there are no
                            Soviet ground or tactical air units ashore in the Mediterranean area.
                            The Soviets could bring in such forces from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, but they would have difficulty in making them
                            operationally effective in a short-lived war. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could also provide some covert
                            military support—pilots in Egyptian-marked planes flying against Israel
                            or, more likely, in defense of Arab cities; ground support crews; and
                            perhaps some naval personnel.</p>
                        <p>51. But given the probability of Israeli victory in fairly short order,
                            the odds would be high that the Soviets would fear involving themselves
                            militarily in a losing cause, with all the political damage within and
                            outside the area that this would entail. Since the Soviets would have an
                            effect only if they intervened quickly, and on a scale which they would
                            estimate would risk involving the US, we doubt that they would embark on
                            such an adventure.</p>

                        <p>52. The instability of certain client states of the <gloss

                            states could produce situations which threatened the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s friends or interests. In such
                            circumstances, the Soviets might <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0463"
                            />be tempted to use military force—as they have done in a limited way in
                            the Yemen civil war. Such possibilities could arise in the course of the
                            chronic factional struggles in Syria or Iraq, or if there were a request
                            for direct Soviet military help from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> in a domestic crisis. In a situation involving
                            struggle between rival Arab groups, Moscow might think it could pre-empt
                            a Western move by moving in troops itself. At present the Soviets have a
                            limited capability for rapid intervention. There may be as many as 500
                            naval infantry troops with the Mediterranean squadron—sufficient for a
                            token landing. A substantial force could be moved in relatively quickly
                            from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but this would entail
                            overflight problems with Iran, Turkey, or Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>53. The Soviets would almost certainly be reluctant to commit their own
                            armed forces in the Middle East for such purposes. For one thing, coups
                            in the Middle East usually occur too quickly for intervention by outside
                            powers to be decisive. More basically, the Soviets have no wish to find
                            themselves embroiled in Arab domestic strife, particularly if there is a
                            risk of finding themselves on the losing side. And they are likely to
                            avoid any actions—such as moving troops into Syria—which might bring
                            about all-out Arab-Israeli warfare or threaten to involve the US. In
                            general, the rule that the Soviets prefer to avoid risks in
                            unpredictable and uncontrolled situations would apply in such cases.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>54. In nuclear war, the Soviets' primary concern in the Mediterranean
                            would be to limit damage from Western strategic forces, particularly
                            ballistic missile submarines. At this time, Soviet ASW capabilities
                            against the latter are extremely poor, despite the deployment of more
                            modern ASW surface ships, including the helicopter ship, Moskva. Newer
                            classes of Soviet ships, including nuclear-powered attack submarines,
                            may soon be deployed to the Mediterranean. By 1975 Soviet capabilities
                            to detect Polaris-type submarines may be somewhat improved, especially
                            in restricted areas such as the Mediterranean. But the Soviets would
                            still be unable to impair gravely the value of Polaris as a strategic
                            weapon in the Mediterranean.<note n="8" xml:id="d138fn8">For a fuller

                        <p>55. At present, Soviet military capabilities for non-nuclear war with
                            Western powers in the Mediterranean are limited by the lack of tactical
                            air support and an inadequate and vulnerable logistics system. A
                            significant effort to ameliorate these shortcomings would be <pb n="431"
                                xml:id="pg_431" facs="0464"/>extremely expensive and would draw down
                            from more pressing general purpose force needs elsewhere. Efforts to
                            acquire military bases for use in such conflicts would be a difficult
                            and politically risky course. In the event of a major crisis in this
                            area, the Soviets would be able to augment their Mediterranean naval
                            squadron. If conflict were to break out, they would seek to attack
                            Western naval forces, particularly aircraft carriers. In addition, the
                            Soviet threat to Western naval forces and lines of communication would
                            be enhanced by the difficulties of detecting Soviet submarines, and by
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s capability of bringing more
                            submarines into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic.</p>

                        <p>56. Some aspects of the Soviet position in the Mediterranean area are of
                            course susceptible to direct Soviet control. The strength of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s naval squadron, the size of its
                            military and economic assistance programs, and the degree of its
                            political support for radical Arab objectives all are dependent on
                            decisions made in Moscow. But many of the basic circumstances which
                            shape Soviet policy in the area are determined in the main by decisions
                            made elsewhere—in Tel Aviv, in Cairo, in Washington. In the totality,
                            then, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is only one of several
                            principal actors in the area and it is always possible that—as during
                            the June War of 1967—it will find itself playing a part not entirely of
                            its own devising.</p>
                        <p>57. It is true nonetheless that Moscow's assumption of a leading role in
                            the area is a significant and probably durable accomplishment. It does
                            not now appear that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will again
                            be content to play a minor role in the Middle East and the
                            Mediterranean. Even in the event of another Arab-Israeli war and another
                            defeat for major Soviet clients, the Soviets would almost certainly
                            retain some sort of position in the area—though it would probably for a
                            time be reduced—and would continue to have a voice in the shaping of
                            postwar configurations. With or without such a war, the political
                            climate of the region is likely to remain generally turbulent. Radical
                            nationalist forces will continue to work against Western interests in
                            the area and in their endeavors will no doubt continue to find Soviet
                            support.</p>
                        <p>58. It seems entirely plausible that Soviet estimates of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s prospects in the Mediterranean
                            basin do not depart substantially from the general picture sketched
                            above. In any case the Soviets must be optimistic about their ability to
                            remain among the major movers of the area. Still, over a decade of close
                            involvement with their mercurial clients has probably persuaded them to
                            be fairly cautious in their assessments. Certainly they can have few
                            illusions about the military capabilities of the Arab states. And just
                            as certainly they cannot believe that the problems of the more immediate
                            future will always resolve themselves to the benefit of Soviet
                            interests. By the same token, however, occasional setbacks <pb n="432"
                                xml:id="pg_432" facs="0465"/>and miscalculations will probably not
                            seriously discourage them or deflect them from their course. In any

                        <p>I am writing you to ask your government's assistance in achieving full
                            compliance with the 1962 Geneva Agreements on Laos.<note n="2"

                                pp. 244–249)</note> These Agreements were intended to protect the
                            independence and neutrality of Laos and to prevent the use of Lao
                            territory for interference in the internal affairs of other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The presence of over 65,000 North Vietnamese troops in Laos and their
                            recent offensives represent a major violation of these Agreements. I
                            believe that this situation calls for prompt action by your government
                            and the other signatories of the Agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam has disregarded the Geneva Agreements
                            from the very beginning. In 1962, only 40 North Vietnamese “advisers”
                            and “technicians” were withdrawn from Laos through the inspection
                            machinery set up for the purpose, while thousands of North Vietnamese
                            troops remained in the country. Since then, in persistent, flagrant
                            violation of the Agreements, the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam has
                            continued to send thousands of soldiers into Laos to fight there and
                            through Laos to fight in South Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>The record of North Vietnamese aggression against Laos has been
                            documented in official papers published by the Royal Government of Laos,
                            including messages to the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and in
                            reports by the International Commission for Supervision and Control
                            pursuant to its responsibility under the 1962 Agreements.</p>
                        <p>Under Article 8 of the Protocol to the Declaration of the Neutrality of
                            Laos, your Foreign Minister is jointly charged with the Foreign Minister
                            of the United Kingdom with supervision over the observance of the
                            Declaration and Protocol. I assure you that my Government would welcome
                            any reasonable steps which the Co-Chairmen might take to assure that the
                            Geneva Agreements are complied with, that the sovereignty, independence,
                            neutrality, unity and territorial integrity of Laos are preserved, and
                            that Lao territory is not used for the purpose of interference in the
                            internal affairs of other countries.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, I understand that the Prime Minister of the Royal
                            Government of Laos has recently addressed an appeal to the Co-Chairmen
                            to bring about consultations among the signatories of the Geneva
                            Agreements on Laos under the provision of Article 4 of the Declaration.
                            My Government would welcome such action on the part of the Co-Chairmen
                            and is prepared to cooperate fully.</p>

                            Aide's Office at the White House at 3:00 p.m. The meeting had come about
                            because during our last conversation <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had indicated some doubt about the relationship
                                <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0467"/>between the Safeguard
                            components for area defense and the Safeguard components of point
                            defense, and I told him that I would give him a briefing explaining the
                            difference.</p>
                        <p>I took Larry Lynn of my staff along. We talked briefly about the problem
                            of area defense and of point defense, the various types of missiles that
                            were necessary for both, and why the area defense we were planning was
                            not a threat to the Soviet Union. It was clear, however, that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was not interested in that. He
                            asked a few perfunctory questions which, incidentally, showed that he
                            had studied the subject very carefully. He then said that he wanted to
                            talk to me alone.</p>

                                            <item>The Soviets were prepared to discuss either
                                                comprehensive or separate agreement. They believed
                                                that a comprehensive agreement would be better
                                                because it would lead also to a solution of other
                                                political problems. But they were prepared to make
                                                separate agreements, provided it was understood that
                                                the limited agreements would not preclude coming

                                        the Soviet Government had some doubts about the seriousness
                                        with which we approached the negotiations and that it had
                                        some genuine worries whether we really meant to have a
                                        negotiation. I told him that we were extremely serious about
                                        the negotiations and that we were hoping to come to an
                                        agreement. I said that they should know the President well
                                        enough by now to realize that our approach was always
                                        concrete and detailed and that the way to find out whether
                                        we were serious would be for them to engage in serious
                                        discussions. I was sure they would not be disappointed.</p>

                                    <p>“Under instructions from Moscow I would like in confidence to
                                        express some considerations in connection with the
                                        aggravation of the military situation in the Middle

                                            Kosygin</persName> has already drawn the attention of

                                        the dangerous escalation of Israel of military actions
                                        against the UAR and other Arab countries and called upon the
                                        U.S. Government to use its influence so that Israel stop its
                                        armed attacks, dangerous for the cause of peace. The head of
                                        the Soviet Government stated at the same time that on its
                                        part the Soviet Union would show good will and determination
                                        to act in the interests of peace in the Middle East.</p>
                                    <p>“It has been noted in Moscow that the American side,
                                        persistently putting forward the proposal on the cessation
                                        of fire on both sides, gives as its reasons the need to
                                        create a favorable situation for the search of political
                                        settlement. At the same time the United States ignores the
                                        fact that Israel not only occupied by means of aggression
                                        substantial Arab territories for the liberation of which the
                                        Arab peoples are now <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0469"

                                        deep in the UAR and other Arab countries.</p>
                                    <p>“We would like to draw the attention of the American side to
                                        the need for a realistic approach towards this question with
                                        due regard to the political situation in the Arab countries
                                        caused by the people's indignation at the Israeli
                                        aggression. In order to have the escalation of military
                                        operations in the Middle East discontinued it is necessary
                                        first of all that Israel take practical steps in this
                                        direction. We have reason to count that if the Israelis stop
                                        their bombings of the UAR, the UAR on its part will display
                                        restraint in its actions, without, of course, any official
                                        statements to that effect.</p>

                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me
                                        what I thought of these propositions. I said it was very
                                        interesting; I would take it up with the President and let
                                        him know.</p>

                                        <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said
                                        that he had to tell me in confidence that he had been
                                        instructed to call on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"

                                        continuation of bilateral discussions. I said I had wondered
                                        when they would get tired of the quadripartite meetings.
                                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> smiled
                                        and said, “We'll let the quadripartite meetings go on, but
                                        we prefer to talk in the bilateral forum.” He said that, as
                                        he remembered it, there were two outstanding issues: one
                                        having to do with the state of peace, and the second having
                                        to do with the obligations of the two sides. He could tell
                                        me in strictest confidence that the hang-up on the first
                                        point would be met by the Soviet formulation.</p>
                                    <p>Up to now, the Soviets had only offered a cessation of the
                                        state of war; they were now ready to talk about establishing
                                        a state of peace. As for the obligations of the two sides,
                                        the Soviet Union also was prepared to make a concession.
                                        Until now the Soviet Union had insisted that control of
                                        irregular forces would not be possible or would be solved
                                        automatically. They were now ready to offer a formulation
                                        which would make it the responsibility of the Arab
                                        governments.</p>
                                    <p>He said there were a number of other issues with which he did
                                        not wish to bother me. For example, he said the Soviet Union
                                        wanted the UAR to have full sovereignty over the Sinai, but
                                        also that it recognized that Sharm al Sheikh and surrounding
                                        territories would be put under a UN force which could be
                                        removed only by the unanimous vote of the Security Council's
                                        permanent members. In other words, we could have a veto over
                                        the international presence in Sharm al Sheikh.</p>
                                    <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0470"/>
                                    <p>He asked me what I thought our reaction to these proposals
                                        would be. I said I would have to study them but he could be
                                        sure that if there were a positive possibility of making
                                        progress, we would be very receptive. I would be in touch
                                        with him next week about it. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                            >Dobrynin</persName> asked whether he could come to me
                                        if he reached some impasse with <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                            >Sisco</persName> or the Secretary. I said I was always

                                    asked me whether I had been encouraged. I said I have been in

                        <p>36337. 1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            called at his request on Secretary morning March 11 and made detailed
                            presentation, main thrust of which was that Soviets would like to resume
                            US-Soviet Middle East talks and are prepared meet US wishes for more
                            detailed formulation on question of peace providing US will be more
                            forthcoming on question of withdrawal, particularly re Sharm al-Shaykh,
                            Gaza and Syria.</p>
                        <p>2. Soviet Minister Counselor Vorontsov subsequently called on <gloss

                            declined leave text but let <persName corresp="#p_AALRJ1"
                                >Atherton</persName> read it and take full notes, on which following
                            paragraphs are based.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Begin Talking Points</hi>. Further aggravation of
                            Middle East situation makes it urgent that energetic steps be taken to
                            arrest increasing tensions in area. Soviet Government believes that, in
                            addition to ending barbaric Israeli bombings of UAR civilian centers,
                            there is need for new effort by major powers to achieve political
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>4. Soviet Government continues to believe that Middle East settlement
                            should result in just and lasting peace, not just unstable and temporary
                            armistice. Given tense Arab-Israeli relations, there is need for
                            cautious, protracted and serious work to bring positions of parties
                            closer.</p>
                        <p>5. Soviet Government intends to continue seeking settlement through
                            exchange of views with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, although US
                            January reply was far from constructive. Just and lasting peace is
                            possible on basis of earlier Soviet proposals but, to facilitate
                            agreement, Soviet Government has additional considerations to offer.</p>
                        <p>6. Taking into account questions raised by <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss>, Soviets are prepared to discuss those questions,
                            including establishment of peace, in bilateral talks. Preamble of Soviet
                            plan recognizes need for just and stable peace in Middle East. <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has stressed that this question is of
                            prime importance and has said that if Arabs show readiness to establish
                            peace this would remove serious barriers to agreement. Soviet plan is
                            sufficiently clear on this point. Nevertheless, with view to achieving
                            understanding, Soviet Government would be ready to supplement provisions
                            in its plan on cessation of state of war by provision on establishing,
                            as result of settlement, a state of peace.</p>
                        <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0472"/>
                        <p>7. Soviet plan has sufficient concrete provisions about obligations of
                            parties resulting from cessation of state of war and establishment of
                            peace. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, however, seeks more detail
                            on these points as is clear from its October 28 and December 18
                                papers.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">See <ref target="#d98fn3"
                                    >Document 98 and footnote 3</ref> to <ref target="#d109"
                                    >Document 109</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. Soviet Government is prepared to meet US wishes on this question if US
                            side shows due understanding of questions whose solution is of interest
                            to Soviet side, first and foremost those questions concerning the
                            unequivocal recording of provisions for the withdrawal of troops.</p>
                        <p>9. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has still not indicated that it
                            shares Soviet view that sovereignty over Sharm al-Shaykh belongs to UAR.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has also given no assurances
                            that Israeli troops are to withdraw from Gaza sector and that this Arab
                            territory is to be restored to its pre-June 1967 borders with the
                            previous situation there re-established. Soviet Government raised these
                            questions in its December 23, 1969 document<note n="3" xml:id="d141fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d109">Document 109</ref>.</note> and <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has still not replied.</p>
                        <p>10. Replies on these points are important since Soviet Government is
                            convinced that principal issue of settlement is withdrawal of troops and
                            establishment of secure and recognized boundaries. Without exact
                            formulations on these questions, there can be no possibility of moving
                            on whole question of settlement.</p>
                        <p>11. In addition to agreement on withdrawal of troops from all occupied
                            territories and status of peace, it would be useful to consider and
                            agree on other unresolved provisions of UAR-Israeli settlement. Soviet
                            Government proceeds from assumption that both our sides will strive to
                            broaden area of agreement between them.</p>
                        <p>12. Question of Jordan-Israel settlement being considered by Four Powers
                            in New York, but problem of Syria remains untouched in both Two and Four
                            Power talks. Soviet Government notes that <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> has avoided taking position on this question, citing as
                            reason Syrian rejection of SC Resolution 242. In Soviet view, position
                            of Syrian Government does not relieve us of task of working out concrete
                            aspects of Syrian-Israeli settlement. If just solution found, Soviet
                            Government is convinced difficulties stemming from Syrian position would
                            disappear. Principal aspects of Soviet June 17, 1969, plan<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d141fn4">See <ref target="#d58">Document 58</ref>.</note>
                            relate to all countries directly involved in conflict. Soviet Government
                            expects <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to express concrete views on
                            questions touching directly on problem of Syrian-Israeli settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0473"/>
                        <p>13. Soviet Government wishes to raise another matter which it does not
                            consider unimportant. Soviet Government expects <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> to take measures to prevent leaks of information about
                            confidential US-Soviet discussions, which adversely affect course of our
                            consultations. Examples have been publication of text of <persName

                            this can be achieved and will continue its efforts in this direction in

                        <p>15. Secretary responded that we would study both the suggestion to resume
                            bilateral discussions and the substantive Soviet proposals. He made
                            clear that if we should agree to resume bilateral talks, there would
                            have to be an understanding of what the resumption of those talks
                            signifies. Our willingness to resume talks could not be interpreted to
                            mean an acceptance of the Soviet proposals or that we were willing to
                            make concessions going beyond our present position as reflected in the
                            October 28 and December 18 documents.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>We have carefully studied your letter of March 6, 1970.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d142fn2">
                                <ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>.</note> We have also received
                            an appeal from Prince Souvanna Phouma with a proposal on conducting
                            consultations between the States which signed the 1962 Geneva Agreements
                            on Laos.</p>
                        <p>My colleagues and I are perturbed by the situation in Laos, which has
                            lately become aggravated. And we, for our part, have pondered over the
                            causes of this aggravation and over what measures could be undertaken to
                            restore peace and tranquility to the territory of Laos.</p>
                        <p>I should not like, at this time, to go into the background of the present
                            events in Laos, since this would hardly erase the differences that exist
                            in the way our two sides appraise what is happening in that country.</p>
                        <p>The situation in Laos, as is quite obvious, is directly connected with
                            the general situation on the Indo-Chinese peninsula. The cessation of
                            the war in Viet-Nam and a political settlement would facilitate the
                            restoration of peace in Laos as well.</p>
                        <p>To speak, in the present situation, about consultations between the
                            States Parties to the 1962 Convention on Laos is, in our view,
                            completely unrealistic. Do you think it possible to consider the
                            situation appropriate for such consultations when the United States
                            continues the war in Viet-Nam and expands armed intervention in Laos?
                            Moreover, the coalition government created in Viet-Nam in accordance
                            with the 1962 Geneva Agreements, in view of the actions of the
                            right-wing forces, has been paralyzed.</p>
                        <p>It is precisely those right-wing forces which, supported by the American
                            Airforce and actively using special troops under American command,
                            carried out in September of last year attacks in the Kuvshinov [?]<note

                            area, which for a long period of time was under the control of the
                            Pathet-Lao and left-wing neutralists. Patriotic forces took measures to
                            return to their previous positions.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>The matter of restoring peace in Laos should, obviously, begin with
                            consultations between the political forces of Laos. The other day the
                            Central Committee of the Patriotic Front of Laos proposed a concrete
                            and, it seems to us, a highly realistic five-point program for a
                            settlement. As a result of this program, peace would be restored in Laos
                            if all countries respect the sovereignty, independence, neutrality,
                            unity and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Laos, in accordance
                            with the provisions of the 1962 Geneva Agreements on Laos, the cessation
                            of U.S. intervention in Laotian affairs, including the bombing of
                            Laotian territory, the non-participation of Laos in military alliances
                            with other countries and the banning of foreign troops and bases in
                            Laos, respect for the throne, the holding of general, free and
                            democratic elections to the National Assembly and the formation of a
                            democratic government of national unity, the holding during the period
                            from the restoration of peace to the general elections of a political
                            consultative conference with the participation of representatives of the
                            interested parties of Laos for settling all the affairs of the country
                            and forming a temporary coalition government, the uniting of Laos
                            through consultation between the Laotian parties on the basis of the
                            principal of equality and national consent. But, first of all, as set
                            forth in the above-mentioned statement of the Central Committee of the
                            Patriotic Front of Laos, it is essential that the U.S.A. put an end, in
                            the near future, to the escalation of the war and completely and
                            unconditionally cease the bombing of the territory of Laos—only thus can
                            conditions be created which will permit the interested Laotian parties
                            to meet with each other.</p>
                        <p>Thus, it is a question of the necessity, first of all, of the cessation
                            of American intervention in the affairs of Laos, and of Vientiane
                            maintaining a position of neutrality, as stipulated by the Geneva
                            Agreements.</p>
                        <p>We welcome the planned contacts between Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince
                            Souphanouvong and consider that this is exactly the path which, in the
                            event of the cessation of American intervention, will permit ensuring a
                            détente in Laos and create the necessary conditions for a political
                            settlement in that country.</p>
                        <p>As for the Soviet Government, it will, for its part, henceforth undertake
                            efforts directed toward the cessation of military activities in Laos and
                            toward the creation of conditions that will enable that country to
                            develop along the path of peace, independence and neutrality.</p>

                            would study these proposals. He made it clear, however, that if we
                            should agree to resume bilateral talks there would have to be an
                            understanding that this did not mean we accepted the substantive Soviet
                            proposals or that we would be willing to make concessions beyond our
                            present position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">What Does It Mean?</hi> It is not yet clear exactly
                            what the Soviets are up to with this apparent switch from a
                            propagandistic and unconstructive approach to more flexible tactics. As
                            you know, an earlier signal came in the March 5 Four Power session where
                            the Soviets rather suddenly began to indicate their willingness to
                            resume a constructive dialogue after weeks of attacking us in that
                            forum. This bid to resume the bilateral exchange—which was broken off in
                            December when the Soviets responded to our proposals on the UAR-Israel
                            aspect in a <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0477"/>strongly negative
                            and retrogressive manner—apparently is a follow-on to that move. In
                            neither case, however, have they indicated that they are prepared to
                            yield substantially on the issue most important to us and the Israelis—a
                            specific Arab obligation to control the fedayeen and on how the parties
                            will actually negotiate a settlement. Instead, they continue to press
                            for concessions that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>
                            demands and that the Israelis would not accept.</p>
                        <p>It could be that the Soviets came to feel increasingly isolated in the
                            Four Power talks as we persistently stuck to our proposals, the British
                            backed us up and the French search for the middle ground floundered.
                            They may have feared that we were growing tired of their abuse in the
                            Four Power talks and were prepared, if necessary, to end the talks and
                            leave the onus for the deadlock with them. It may also have become
                            increasingly apparent to them that we were not ready to make any more
                            concessions, at least without substantial quid pro quo.<note n="3"

                        <p>It may be that the Soviets are concerned to defuse the growing appearance
                            of confrontation, which they themselves launched with the <persName

                            with the ultimate option of having to escalate their involvement. An
                            additional tactical motive may relate to the Soviet sense of timing on
                            the decision of supplying Phantoms to Israel. The Soviets may have
                            thought a show of flexibility at this time would tip the outcome against
                            a new supply.</p>

                            states—another suggestion the Soviets may be backing away from the

                        <p>Whatever the cause, there are indications that the Soviets and Egyptians
                            want to keep the negotiating option open. These recent moves were
                            immediately preceded by a visit of Deputy Foreign Minister <persName

                            issues.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> There may be some merit in letting
                            the Soviets sweat it out a bit longer in hopes that they may change in
                            substance as well as approach. They have come to us with a bid to resume
                            the bilateral talks, but have not yet indicated any real give in
                            substance. If we intend to stick with our proposals in their present
                            form, there would <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0478"/>seem to be
                            little point in reopening the bilateral dialogue and ease the apparent
                            pressure on the Soviets without any promise of substantive progress.</p>
                        <p>There is also the problem of what to do with the Four Power talks. The
                            British and especially the French see this forum as being the most
                            productive and might be dismayed to see us abandon it again for private
                            talks with the Soviets. The French, of course, have been difficult and
                            the British are showing signs of becoming somewhat of a problem, but
                            both are still manageable. We may even be able to buy more time in the
                            Four Power talks if our current gambit to shift them away from drawing
                            up guidelines for <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> to

                        <p>While the Reuters report seems dramatic and too detailed for
                            plausibility, recent signs taken together seem to point to increasing
                            problems within the leadership. As noted in an earlier memorandum to
                            you, the heart of the problem seems to be the dissatisfaction over
                            economic matters.</p>
                        <p>An “honorable” retirement for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> might be a logical way to break a deadlock at
                            the top. At the same time, there have been recurring reports of his
                            failing health. Recently, a Soviet guide at the Soviet photographic
                            exhibit here was overheard to say that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> was due for an operation.</p>
                        <p>If there is major trouble of the kind reported by Reuters, however, this
                            would be a different matter and could have more far-reaching policy
                            implications. Unfortunately, there is never any sure way to confirm
                            these events, until after they have already taken place, and we are

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> opened the conversation
                            by asking whether there had been some response to his démarche of 10
                            days ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d145fn2">See <ref target="#d140">Document
                                    140</ref>.</note> I said, “Yes, as a matter of fact that is why
                            I asked you to come to see me.” I said we had taken the communication
                            from the Soviet Government with extreme seriousness, as we do every
                            other communication from Moscow. We had, in fact, begun discussions with
                            the Israelis about a ceasefire and had obtained Israeli approval. But
                            within 24 hours of calling them in to make it final and to establish
                            definite time limits, we learned about the introduction of Soviet SA–3
                            missiles and Soviet combat personnel. I had warned <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about the serious consequences
                            of such a step. The move was reminiscent of some tactics employed
                            several years previously on the occasion of the Cuban crisis. The Soviet
                            Government had to learn that the President could not be dealt with on
                            this basis.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the President had canceled his request to the Israelis for a
                            ceasefire, and the matter was now off. If the Soviet Union wanted to
                            make a more equitable proposal some other time, we would be willing to
                            consider it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made some half-hearted
                            comments to the effect that he didn't know anything about these
                            missiles. But if they were defensive, why did we object? I said,
                            “Because it might be that the ceasefire was just being used to improve
                            the Egyptian military position—to improve Egypt's defenses. Once they
                            were fully installed, Egypt could break the ceasefire and Israel would
                            be at a great disadvantage.” If the Soviet Union wanted to make a more
                            equitable proposal, we would be willing to consider it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would have to go
                            to his government and come back with new instructions. He underlined
                            Moscow's great eagerness to dampen down the Middle East situation, and
                            he said he hoped that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> would reply soon to his overture of some weeks
                            ago to restart the bilateral negotiations.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0481"/>
                        <p>I then made a general comment. I said that we were at an important
                            turning point. We were prepared to deal with the Soviet Union precisely,
                            correctly, unemotionally, and thoroughly in the direction of détente, if
                            the Soviet Union would forgo its policy of attempting to squeeze us at
                            every opportunity. For example, when we recommended the ceasefire to
                            Israel, we did so even though we knew the military situation favored our
                            friends. The introduction of Soviet military personnel could only lead
                            to a Vietnam for the Soviet Union, since all we had to do was send in
                            equipment which they could only match by personnel. Nevertheless, we
                            were not trying to take advantage of the situation.<note n="3"

                        <p>I could not say the same for the Soviet behavior in Laos, I continued. We
                            were very disappointed by the Prime Minister's reply. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said we completely
                            misunderstood their role in Laos; they were only being kept informed.
                            They were not making any suggestions and they thought, in any event,
                            that the figures we gave for North Vietnamese troops in Laos were much
                            too high.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that he had
                            had a report from Paris that my conversations there were leading towards
                            a positive direction. I said he had to check with his friends—that I
                            would not give him any comment.<note n="4" xml:id="d145fn4">

                            of conversations if there were progress, but that the Soviet Union could
                            not continue to press in other areas without the most serious
                            consequences.</p>

                            was agreed that one of the political moves which we might carry out in

                            with a tough letter from you telling them that it was their duty to
                            support the Geneva Agreements. In this letter we would make plain that
                            we would not accept their contention that they had no responsibility and
                            add that such a reaction might have an adverse effect on US–<gloss

                            was drafted by State, appropriately conveys the message which we want
                            the Soviets to receive, and also lets them know the gravity with which
                            we view developments in Laos. I believe that your sending the letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would be a useful
                            move. State proposes that we follow it up by sending letters from you to
                            each of the other Geneva signatories calling attention to the threat to
                            Laotian neutrality which now exists, and observing that the signatory
                            powers accordingly have the responsibility of supporting Prime Minister

                            <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                            <p>I wish to thank you for your assurance that you and your government
                                are concerned about the situation in Laos and have considered steps
                                that might be taken to permit peace to return to that country. While
                                I agree with you on the importance of internal consultations among
                                the Lao themselves, I am unable to share your view that
                                consultations among the signatories of the 1962 Geneva Agreements on
                                Laos are unrealistic and would not be helpful.</p>
                            <p>Indeed, I find the position of your government illogical and
                                unconvincing. In your letter<note n="4" xml:id="d146fn4">
                                    <ref target="#d142">Document 142</ref>.</note> you connect the
                                problem of Laos with the general situation on the Indo-China
                                peninsula and refer to American interference in the affairs of Laos.
                                Therefore, even though you do not refer to the Democratic Republic
                                of Vietnam's flagrant violations of the independence, neutrality and
                                territorial integrity of Laos or its use of Lao and Cambodian
                                territory for aggression against the Republic of Vietnam, you
                                clearly recognize the international character of the problem of
                                Laos, including violations of the Geneva Agreements of 1962 on Laos.
                                A solution to the international aspects of the Lao problem is the
                                proper responsibility of the mechanisms established by the 1962
                                Conference. I would be less than frank if I did not point out that
                                the opposition of your government to the holding of consultations
                                under Article IV of the Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos is
                                totally indefensible given your admission that you consider there
                                have been violations of the neutrality of Laos. It is not a question
                                whether the present situation is “good” for such consultations; it
                                is precisely because the situation is not good that such
                                consultations must be held. I call upon you, Mr. Chairman, as the
                                head of one of the two governments most specifically charged by the
                                Geneva Agreements with the supervision over their observance to
                                fulfill your responsibility and, together with the United Kingdom,
                                to call for consultations to consider measures which might prove to
                                be necessary to insure the observance of the sovereignty,
                                independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of
                                Laos.</p>
                            <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0484"/>
                            <p>As I noted in my previous letter,<note n="5" xml:id="d146fn5">
                                    <ref target="#d139">Document 139</ref>.</note> the principal
                                cause of the present hostilities in Laos is the presence there of
                                over 65,000 North Vietnamese troops. The restoration of peace in
                                Laos cannot, therefore, be accomplished solely through consultations
                                among the political forces there as you suggest. Such internal talks
                                can serve a useful purpose, as they did in 1961 and 1962, as an
                                adjunct to international actions dealing with the basic cause of the
                                Lao problem, North Vietnamese aggression in Laos and use of Lao
                                territory for interference in the internal affairs of other
                                countries. I need hardly remind you that the United States air
                                activities in Laos are in response to these antecedent North
                                Vietnamese actions.</p>
                            <p>I assure you that the United States Government will spare no effort
                                to bring peace to Laos through full implementation of the 1962
                                Agreements. I welcome your assurances that the Soviet Government
                                will continue to make efforts aimed at the cessation of military
                                actions in Laos and the creation of conditions for the
                                re-establishment of peace and neutrality. For there can be little
                                doubt that failure to bring peace to Laos will have repercussions
                                beyond the confines of that region of the world and adversely affect
                                our relations. I confirm my Administration's desire to base our
                                relations on the principle of negotiation rather than confrontation
                                and I therefore call upon you to reconsider your position concerning
                                consultations under Article IV of the Declaration on the Neutrality
                                of Laos. I again urge that your government join with mine and the
                                governments of the other signatories in fulfilling the
                                responsibilities we assumed in 1962.</p>

                        <p>1. The President called <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                                Kissinger</persName> and me into the Oval Office after the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting today for what turned out to be
                            a 25-minute discussion of a variety of subjects, including <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, Laos, Cambodia, Cuba, and black
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>[Omitted here is discussion of Cuba and Laos.]</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to black operations, the President enjoined me to hit the
                            Soviets, and hit them hard, any place we can in the world. He said to
                            “just go ahead,” to keep <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry
                                Kissinger</persName> informed, and to be as imaginative as we could.
                            He was as emphatic on this as I have ever heard him on anything. He
                            indicated that he had had a change of mind and thought that Radio Free
                            Europe should be continued. I took this moment to hit hard on the point
                            that I felt strongly the United States should give up nothing which
                            constituted a pressure on the Soviet Union or an irritation to them
                            without exacting a specific price in return. The President agreed with
                            this and pointed out that we had had nothing from the Russians—in the
                            recent past “except assistance on the shape of the table at the Paris
                            talks.” I indicated that we were coming up with a paper on covert
                            actions aimed at the Soviet Union.</p>

                        <p>“We have studied carefully the oral statement conveyed by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> March 11 and would
                            like to comment on it point-by-point.</p>
                        <p>“We agree that there is need for steps to arrest the increasing tensions
                            in the Middle East. This was the purpose of our proposals for
                            restoration of the ceasefire and for arms limitation talks, which the
                            Soviet Government has not accepted. We do not share the Soviet
                            Government's one-sided view that an end to Israeli bombing would in
                            itself be productive. The Soviet Government knows that it was the UAR
                            which initiated a policy of nonobservance of the ceasefire. There can
                            only be a decrease in the level of violence if observance of the
                            cease-fire is reciprocal. We urge the Soviet Government to reassess its
                            position both with respect to the ceasefire and arms limitation
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>“We agree with the Soviet Government on the need for new efforts to
                            achieve a political settlement. This is why we have urged the Soviet
                            Union to take a more constructive approach to the proposals of October
                            28, in which we sought to reflect joint US-Soviet views, and to the
                            December 18 proposals.</p>
                        <p>“We note with satisfaction that the Soviet Government has reaffirmed the
                            need for a just and lasting peace which is, of course, the stated
                            purpose of Security Council Resolution 242. We are also pleased that the
                            Soviet Government has referred to the need to bring the positions of the
                            parties closer. This has been repeatedly emphasized by us as an
                            essential element of both the Two Power and Four Power talks.</p>
                        <p>“We also note that the Soviet Government wishes to continue exchanging
                            views on a bilateral basis. We have no objection in principle to
                            resuming the Two Power talks at an early date. The probability that such
                            talks would prove fruitful would be enhanced if the Soviet Union could
                            provide beforehand certain clarifications of its position. In saying
                            that it is prepared to meet the wish of the United States for greater
                            detail on the question of peace, does the Soviet Government mean that it
                            would accept Point 2 of our proposals? The Soviet answer to this
                            question will contribute to a clearer understanding between us about the
                            basis for resuming our bilateral exchanges. In saying this, we clearly
                            understand that Soviet acceptance of the language of Point 2 would be
                            contingent upon agreement on all other points of difference between us.
                            Major power agreement on guidelines for <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> must be a package just as the final agreement
                            between the parties themselves.</p>
                        <p>“We note that the Soviet Government wants us to show understanding on
                            questions of interest to it including above all the question of
                            withdrawal. This question is also of interest to the United States, and
                            we have said many times there can be no peace without withdrawal. We
                            have made our position on withdrawal quite clear. As concerns the UAR,
                            to which the Ambassador's oral statement referred, we have said <pb
                                n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0487"/>Israel should withdraw to the
                            old international boundary. We have also said that in our view there
                            must be agreement between the parties on practical security arrangements
                            in the Sharm al-Shaykh area. Such arrangements would have to provide an
                            absolute guarantee of free navigation through the Strait of Tiran as
                            called for in Resolution 242; it is not our intention that they should
                            call into question UAR sovereignty over Sharm al-Shaykh.</p>
                        <p>“With respect to Gaza, our view is that it is a special case since the
                            question of sovereignty there has never been resolved. The Soviet
                            Government calls for the re-establishment in Gaza of the pre-June 1967
                            situation. That situation, however, was based on the Armistice Agreement
                            of 1949, whereas we are now seeking a final peace. Re-establishment of
                            the pre-June 1967 situation would be inconsistent with the view,
                            expressed elsewhere in the Ambassador's statement, that a settlement
                            ‘should result in just and lasting peace, not just unstable and
                            temporary armistice.’ In light of this consideration and of the
                            unresolved question of sovereignty, we believe the disposition of Gaza
                            is an appropriate subject of negotiations between the parties.</p>
                        <p>“We agree with the Soviet Government that it would be useful to consider
                            other unresolved provisions of a UAR-Israeli settlement and that both
                            our governments should strive to broaden areas of agreement between us.
                            Among these unresolved provisions is the question of the method of
                            reaching agreement, to which we attach importance and which must be
                            considered in light of operative paragraph 3 of Resolution 242.<note

                                1967)</note> The Ambassador's statement did not refer to this
                            question. Does the Soviet Government still accept the language on the
                            Rhodes formula agreed between us in September? If not, does the Soviet
                            Government have alternative language to propose which would make equally
                            clear that the negotiating process under Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s auspices would include both
                            indirect and direct negotiations at various stages as was the case when
                            Dr. <persName>Bunche</persName> dealt with the parties in 1949.</p>
                        <p>“On the problem of Syria to which the Ambassador's statement referred,
                            our position is clear. Syria has rejected Resolution 242 and has not
                            cooperated with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName>. In these circumstances, <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> cannot carry out his mandate of
                            promoting agreement on the Syrian aspect of a settlement since the
                            process of reaching agreement requires the cooperation of both sides.
                            There is thus no basis for developing guidelines for <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> on the Syrian aspect. There is
                            no other <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0488"/>route to a settlement
                            than Resolution 242 and the <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> Mission. Once agreement has been reached and
                            carried out between Israel and the UAR, and between Israel and Jordan,
                            there should be no difficulties in the way of Syria's taking the
                            necessary steps which would make possible consideration of a settlement
                            also between Israel and Syria.</p>
                        <p>“With respect to the question of press leaks, we assure the Soviet
                            Government that we share its desire to avoid such leaks. Both of us must
                            recognize, however, that in view of the deep interest in Middle Eastern
                            developments, press contact cannot be completely avoided. As for the
                            leak of the exchange of letters between Chairman <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, we reconfirm our previous
                            assurance to the Soviet Government that it is not our policy to publish
                            such confidential correspondence with other heads of government, that we
                            did not do so in this case, and that we regret these letters were made
                            available to the press by others to whom they were entrusted.</p>
                        <p>“Finally, the Soviet Government is correct in assuming that the United
                            States is guided by a desire to strengthen international security and to
                            develop the relations between our two nations. We are pleased that the
                            Soviet Government feels, as we do, that it would serve neither of our
                            interests for the Middle East to become an area of confrontation between
                            us.”</p>

                                    existing trends toward more active dissidence could be affected
                                    by external developments. The discrediting of the regime by a
                                    serious economic crisis or another Czech-type crisis might
                                    promote radical changes in the internal political

                            </p>
                            <p>At no time in the history of the Soviet Union to date have political
                                forces outside the Communist Party leadership played a significant
                                role in influencing events. The Party apparatus, the KGB and the
                                deeply vested interests of the Soviet State hierarchy are
                                experienced in coping with dissidence of all types, and have an
                                impressive record of asserting their will at any cost to the rest of
                                society. The KGB in particular has an almost perfect record of
                                successful penetration, manipulation and suppression of opposition
                                elements. In addition there is an historic tradition of public
                                apathy, largely unchanged even today among the workers and peasants
                                of Russia, and dissident elements find little encouragement at the
                                grass roots. The authorities have often exploited the antipathy of
                                the working class toward the intelligentsia in suppressing incipient
                                demonstrations.</p>
                            <p>Thus the experience of Russian history strongly argues against the
                                proposition that the internal dissident will significantly influence
                                Soviet society in the short term. The conditions, nevertheless,
                                which abet existing trends toward more active and articulate
                                dissidence could be <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0491"

                                by, say, another Czechoslovak crisis or a serious economic crisis,
                                might well promote radical changes in the internal political
                                climate. The paragraphs that follow should be considered in this
                                light.</p>

                            <p>To describe the nature and scope of dissidence in the Soviet Union
                                today poses the risk of over-emphasis. The Soviet regime is by no
                                means on the brink of collapse. On the other hand, something new has
                                indeed emerged in Soviet society since Stalin's death. The growing
                                demand for freedom of expression has been widely reported in the
                                Western press, and its suppression by Soviet authorities has in turn
                                contributed to disillusionment among foreign Communists and Soviet
                                sympathizers.</p>
                            <p>The top rank of dissenters in the Soviet Union includes leading
                                scientists, some of whom share the views of Andrey Sakharov, an
                                eminent scientist. In 1968, Sakharov in a long pamphlet advocated
                                radical changes in human society the world over. Speaking of his own
                                country, he called for tolerance of political opposition,
                                elimination of censorship, and frank discussion of Stalin's use of
                                terror. Later in 1968, other prominent scientists including Peter
                                Kapitsa, the Soviet Union's leading theoretical physicist, told
                                Western colleagues that they agreed with Sakharov. The Sakharov
                                pamphlet has never been published in the Soviet Union, but through
                                Western radio broadcasts and publications Sakharov's words have been
                                carried back to his countrymen.</p>
                            <p>After the scientists, next in prestige come the writers, whose
                                tradition of social concern goes back to Turgenev, Tolstoy and even
                                earlier. Their involvement in politics and protest has almost always
                                been reluctant. Alexander Solzhenitsyn tried for years to remain
                                aloof, but his determination to write what he believed and his
                                refusal to conform to the requirements of the Party put him squarely
                                against the censors and the Soviet Writers' Union. Last fall the
                                Writers' Union expelled Solzhenitsyn for his recalcitrance. Learning
                                that he had been expelled without an opportunity to defend his
                                position, Solzhenitsyn wrote a letter to the leaders of the Union
                                that epitomizes the attitude of the creative intelligentsia toward
                                the Party hacks who control the institutions of Soviet society. “The
                                face of your clock has been rubbed out: Your clock is far behind the
                                times. Open your heavy curtains. You do not even know that outside

                                dangerously sick society you are not able to suggest anything
                                constructive, anything good, only your own hatred and your spying on
                                others and your determination to coerce and never to let go.”</p>
                            <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0492"/>
                            <p>Beyond the circle of leading scientists and writers there are the
                                active dissidents themselves. Most of them are younger members of
                                the intelligentsia, but their ranks also include workers, teachers,
                                and other professionals. A leading physicist in this group runs the
                                only “underground press” known to exist in the Soviet Union. In May
                                1969 fifteen of the most active dissidents organized a Committee for
                                the Defense of Human Rights, and petitioned the United Nations to
                                protest against violations of human rights in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. They were joined by some fifty
                                other persons who publicly announced their support of the Committee.
                                When the first petition received no answer, they sent a second. Now,
                                ten months afterward, ten of the fifteen of the organizers of the
                                Committee have been imprisoned or placed in mental hospitals, a
                                favorite device of the regime for handling awkward cases.</p>
                            <p>In April 1968 the group began a bi-monthly <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Chronicle of Current Events</hi>, reporting in detail on
                                arrests, threats and other coercive acts the Soviet regime uses to
                                suppress opposition, plus the latest news concerning underground
                                literature and petitions. Ten issues of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Chronicle</hi> were subsequently circulated in hundreds of
                                typewritten copies inside the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                                A few copies of each reached the West, where they have been
                                republished and broadcast back into the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>The writing and circulation of protest documents of many varieties,
                                typed in carbon copies or handwritten, continues in the face of
                                regime repression. In early 1968 the trial of Ginsburg and Galanskov
                                inspired hundreds of Soviet citizens to risk censure, job loss or
                                imprisonment by appealing to the authorities on behalf of the
                                defendants. The petitioners and protestors have since supported
                                other causes, and have proposed their own political programs as
                                alternatives to the Communist Party's dictatorship. As one leader of
                                the dissident movement, Lydia Chukovskaya, wrote: “The conspiracy of
                                silence is at an end.”</p>
                            <p>In reaction to the increasing repression of creative freedom in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, outstanding
                                representatives of the Soviet intelligentsia have forsaken their
                                homeland for life in the West. In addition to Stalin's daughter,
                                Svetlana, they include three distinguished writers, a prominent
                                philosopher and editor, a young nuclear physicist, two outstanding
                                musicians, a magazine editor, two leading experts on cybernetics, a
                                movie director, a film critic and three students from Moscow
                                University's Institute of Eastern Languages.</p>
                            <p>The picture of the Soviet Union that these defectors paint is one of
                                increasing cynicism and alienation on the part of the
                                intelligentsia, and apathy and bitterness in the working class. The
                                philosopher mentioned above had this to say on the subject: “People
                                are still afraid to trust one another entirely. I shared my real
                                views only with three other men. Yet one knows how everybody
                                feels—disillusioned, contemptuous of the bosses and frustrated by
                                the Party careerists who know nothing <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460"
                                    facs="0493"/>but how to win and keep power. Now these careerists
                                sense their isolation from the rest of the population. They no
                                longer believe in anything. There are no idealists like my father
                                left among them. They only know that to keep their power they must
                                stick together, like cattle surrounded by wolves.”</p>

                            <p>Among many of the non-Russian minorities in the Soviet Union, dissent
                                is vocal and widespread. It is also vigorously repressed. In the
                                Ukraine, the arrests of hundreds of Ukrainian dissidents in 1965 and
                                1966, and subsequent repressions, have been vigorously protested by
                                leading Ukrainian scientists, artists, and writers, including Oleg
                                Antonov, one of the Soviet Union's leading aircraft designers.</p>
                            <p>The contempt of the Baltic people for Soviet rule remains as strong
                                as ever. It is no longer expressed in hopeless armed resistance, as
                                it was twenty years ago. Instead, these small nations manifest a
                                vigorous determination to preserve their national cultures. Even the
                                local Communist Party apparatus has sought to assert a degree of
                                autonomy. In Estonia many works of Western literature that have
                                never been published in Russian are printed in the native language.
                                Two of the major underground documents recently proposing
                                alternatives to the Communist dictatorship originated in
                                Estonia.</p>

                            <p>Since the December 1969 Central Committee Plenum, the Soviet press
                                has given increasing attention to the lethargy of the economy. The
                                best informed defectors and even Soviet economists depict the
                                economy as suffering from overcentralization, rigid control, and a
                                system of falsification and misrepresentation that prevents anyone
                                from knowing what the true conditions are. A recent letter to

                                through underground channels in Moscow described the problems of the
                                economy in the following terms: “It is obvious to everyone that in
                                our system nobody is involved in real work. They only throw dust in
                                the eyes of the bosses. Phony events, such as jubilees and special
                                days, have become for us more important than the real events of
                                economic and social life…. Other states in which the economy is not
                                ruled from the heavens, but from earth … are outdistancing us more
                                and more … Freedom to discuss problems openly, only such freedom,
                                can put diseased Russia on the road to recovery.”</p>

                            <p>In addition to its domestic problems, the Soviet Union has had
                                chronic difficulty in managing its satellites in Eastern Europe. In
                                Eastern Europe the tensions in society are much greater than in the
                                Soviet Union, the Western orientation much stronger, and the
                                possibility <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0494"/>exists that at
                                some future time one or more of these countries may successfully
                                make the transition that Czechoslovakia essayed in 1968. It seems
                                inevitable that, as long as the Soviet Union maintains its current
                                system, it will be impossible for the peoples of Eastern Europe to
                                live in real harmony with the Soviet Union and that, to maintain
                                hegemony in the area, the Soviets will have to continue to rely upon
                                force.</p>
                            <p>Dissident elements in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                                Eastern Europe display remarkable sympathy and understanding for
                                their fellows throughout the whole Soviet dominated region. Pavel
                                Litvinov, Larissa Daniel and others were exiled from Moscow for
                                trying to stage a peaceful demonstration against the Soviet invasion
                                of Czechoslovakia. Others protested the biased reporting in the
                                Soviet press and Soviet threats before the troops moved in.
                                Intellectuals in all Eastern European countries have actively
                                collaborated with the Soviet dissidents, and have expressed their
                                sympathy for those arrested and imprisoned.</p>
                            <p>With its easier access to the West, Eastern Europe acts as a conduit
                                for books, letters, manuscripts and ideas. The flow back and forth
                                across the Soviet borders is relatively easy and constant. The fact
                                that Eastern European standards of tolerance and freedom of
                                expression, although restrictive, are well above the levels
                                permitted in the Soviet Union makes the region's ability to
                                influence the Soviet Union a consideration of major importance to
                                the United States.</p>

                            <p>RFE currently broadcasts 19 hours daily into Poland, Czechoslovakia

                                conducts an extensive and respected research program on Eastern <pb

                                achieved a high degree of Eastern European listener acceptance as a
                                station which identifies with their needs, thoughts and aspirations.
                                It is estimated that over 30 million people listen to RFE
                                broadcasts. This percentage rises dramatically during periods of
                                international crisis. RFE is denounced almost daily by Communist
                                media, and on occasion by key figures of the Eastern European
                                governments. Czechoslovak Party Secretary Husak has publicly placed
                                a large share of the blame on RFE for his Party's inability to win
                                over the Czechoslovak population.</p>
                            <p>The station is a political force with which the Eastern European
                                regimes must reckon. The reason for this lies partly in RFE's
                                pattern of cross-reporting—i.e., reporting in detail to all the
                                Eastern European countries on domestic developments in the
                                individual countries. This is in effect the principal way the
                                peoples of the area learn of significant developments in their own
                                and neighboring countries. It can be demonstrated that RFE's
                                repeated exposure of domestic policies and methods has forced
                                modification of censorship and similar restrictions in several of
                                the Eastern European countries.</p>
                            <p>RFE's role in the 1968 Czechoslovak crisis is a striking example of
                                the radio's effectiveness. Prior to the ousting of Party First
                                Secretary Novotny in January 1968, RFE was the chief source of
                                factual information and research analysis on domestic affairs for
                                much of the Czechoslovak population. After the Soviet invasion and
                                the loss of their new-found freedom, the Czechoslovak people again
                                became dependent on the round-the-clock reporting of RFE. Audience
                                research indicates that RFE's listenership rose to 70 percent of the
                                population. The station received thousands of letters extolling its
                                programs, while the Communist news media unleashed an unprecedented
                                series of attacks on RFE. The Soviet journal <hi rend="italic">Red
                                    Star</hi> described the radio as the “most strategic weapon in
                                the global psychological war being carried on by the United States
                                against the world socialist system.”</p>

                            <p>Radio Liberty broadcasts round-the-clock in the Russian language, 14
                                hours a day in Ukrainian, and at varying lengths in 15 other
                                national languages. In contrast to RFE, RL is targeted against the
                                more restrictive Soviet system. Effectiveness is more difficult to
                                measure. However, letters from listeners, defector reports and legal
                                travelers indicate that there is a sizeable audience. It is
                                generally agreed that RL merits a significant share of the credit
                                for the increasing manifestations of dissent and opposition among
                                the Soviet intelligentsia. In this respect the Sinyavskiy–Daniel
                                trial of 1966 was a landmark. RL played a unique role in conveying
                                the facts, the significance, and Western reactions to the trial to
                                the Soviet people. RL has also broadcast back into the Soviet Union
                                detailed information on every important letter, protest <pb n="463"

                                literature which has reached the West through underground channels.

                                have specifically cited RL's vital function in providing such
                                information and thereby expanding the scope and depth of dissident
                                attitudes.</p>

                            <p>Soviet and Eastern European attempts to discredit RFE and RL are
                                intensive and coordinated. The Communist regimes are particularly
                                discomfited by the two radios' detailed news coverage and highly
                                effective cross-reporting of internal developments, and by their
                                exploitation of intellectual ferment, nationalist tendencies and
                                general dissent within the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>A measure of the Soviet concern over Western broadcasts is the extent
                                of the Soviet jamming effort. At this time, Czechoslovakia and
                                Bulgaria also extensively jam RFE broadcasts. According to a VOA
                                study, the Soviets use 2,000–2,500 jammers at an estimated annual
                                cost of $150,000,000. As indicated above, however, the jamming is
                                marginally effective inasmuch as the target audiences hear the
                                radios on one or more frequencies. The cost of the Soviet jamming
                                effort can be put into perspective by comparing it with the annual
                                operating costs of FE, Inc., and RLC, Inc., $21,723,000 and
                                $12,770,000 respectively. The radios represent a 20-year investment
                                of over $400,000,000.</p>

                                Communist Party or popular front election victory in the Free World,
                                we have met the threat and turned it successfully. Guyana in 1963
                                and Chile in 1964 are good examples of what can be accomplished
                                under difficult circumstances. Similar situations may soon face us
                                in various parts of the world, and we are prepared for action with
                                carefully planned covert election programs when U.S. policy calls
                                for them.</p>

                        <p>The conversation took place at <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>'s initiative prior to his departure for the
                            Soviet Union for consultations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> turned the conversation to Vietnam. He said
                            that he wanted to understand our position: were we committed to
                            maintaining an anti-Communist Government in Saigon or were we willing to
                            settle for true neutrality?</p>
                        <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>I asked why he wanted to know. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that if we were interested in maintaining
                            an anti-Communist Government, the war would inevitably go on. If we were
                            interested in a neutral government, then the Soviet Union might be able
                            to be of some help. He knew we could sustain the war for another seven
                            years if we wanted an anti-Communist Government, but this wouldn't lead
                            to any conclusion.</p>
                        <p>When I probed his comment that the Soviet Union could be of some help, he
                            said it might be possible to find some formula for neutrality. I replied
                            that it depended on what they understood by neutrality. If they meant
                            that neutrality entitled them to select the participants in a government
                            and that the process had to begin with our eliminating our allies and
                            the people we had been supporting, then this was absolutely out of the
                            question. If their definition of neutrality matched what was commonly
                            understood by that term, then there existed a real possibility for
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me about our
                            views of a political settlement. I said that the sharing of political
                            power was not an easy matter to define and that I did not want to be
                            doctrinaire about it. It seemed to me, however, that: <list>
                                <item>—first, one had to accept the Saigon Government as an
                                    objective reality;</item>
                                <item>—secondly, some process had to be developed to consult the
                                    will of the people;</item>
                                <item>—thirdly, there would have to be guarantees that would enable
                                    the participants in the political process to survive
                                    defeat.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would think
                            about this and report fully to his government.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Middle East</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> next turned the
                            conversation to the Middle East. He said that we might not believe it,
                            but the Soviet Union was genuinely interested in a compromise. However,
                            he had come to the conclusion that talking to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> was getting to be a waste of
                            time. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> was trying to be a
                            great diplomat and operator. He was dealing with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as if <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not have any experience in
                            diplomacy himself. For example, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> was asking him to write down the conditions of
                            peace or Arab peace obligations without in advance committing himself to
                            the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian territory. This was an
                            amateurish maneuver. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> could
                            choose those elements of the Soviet proposal he liked while the Soviets
                            were compromising themselves with the Egyptians, who were not in any
                            event enthusiastic about the whole negotiating process.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that it would be
                            good if I intervened. I replied that we had made one effort to intervene
                            and had been tricked by the Soviet introduction of SA–3s.</p>
                        <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0499"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had been
                            instructed to tell me that the offer of a cease-fire still stood. He did
                            not understand why we should be bothered by the SA–3s which were purely
                            defensive weapons.</p>
                        <p>I told him that one of the most difficult issues in the history of
                            disarmament negotiations has been how to define “defensive.” If the
                            Israelis were deprived of air retaliation, they lost their most
                            effective counter to Egyptian guerrilla raids. Thus, SA–3 missiles
                            could, in fact, enhance the Egyptian offensive capability. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that this was not true as
                            long as the Israelis maintain air superiority on their side of the Suez
                            Canal.</p>
                        <p>He then asked tentatively what we would say if the Soviets promised to
                            keep their deployment confined to Alexandria, Cairo and the Aswan Dam. I
                            replied this might be worth considering. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he would come back to this
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that the
                            Soviets were interested in a real compromise. He said they were prepared
                            to agree to establishing a state of peace and to spell out the
                            conditions and obligations of peace with great precision once they knew
                            what we were prepared to do. He thought that all we were doing was
                            sending <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> on a fishing
                            expedition.</p>
                        <p>I said it was true that the President did not take the same active
                            interest in the Middle East negotiations that he did, for example, on
                            Vietnam and <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>. However, this could
                            change if we saw some degree of Soviet cooperation on the Middle East
                            issues that concerned us most.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he couldn't
                            recall our beginning a negotiation in which the two sides knew so little
                            about one another. He said perhaps we should have made some concrete
                            proposal to him informally on which he could have sounded out his
                            government. In the previous Administration, Foster always let him know
                            the Administration's thinking.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I had offered
                            to talk to him but he had never picked this up. After some inconclusive
                            fencing about who had been responsible for the offer not being taken up,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that his
                            government was serious about these negotiations. However, my suggestion
                            that he and I settle the matter in our channel presented a difficulty.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SVS1">Semenov</persName> was a Deputy Foreign
                            Minister and it was hard for a mere Ambassador to interject himself. It
                            would help their deliberations in Moscow if I gave him some feel for
                            what our position was likely to be. They would consider that as a sign
                            of our good faith.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">

                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that before he
                            left I would indicate whether our position involved a comprehensive or a
                            more limited option, but I would not give him the substance. I
                            reaffirmed my willingness to settle a more limited agreement in this
                            channel with him.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked whether we
                            would be prepared to expand trade. I said that this depended on the
                            general state of our relationship.</p>
                        <p>This caused <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to say that
                            he had noticed that at the beginning of each Administration there was
                            great reluctance to make progress. Towards the end of an Administration
                            the willingness for progress increased, but by then time had run out.
                            For example, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> tried to
                            have a summit in the last six months of his Administration when it no
                            longer made sense. It would have been very easy to arrange one several
                            years earlier.</p>
                        <p>I said that for us summits were instruments; everything depended on what
                            we wanted to achieve there. In principle, though, we were willing to
                            have a summit with the Soviet leaders if it would lead to some practical
                            result.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> became visibly
                            attentive. He had thought we were not interested and had told his
                            leaders that a summit was not possible before 1971–1972. They had been
                            very interested last year but had been put off by us. He asked if I was
                            sure we were willing to have a summit. I replied that we were, under
                            certain circumstances, for example, if there were the prospect of a
                            major breakthrough on Vietnam. I was willing to discuss the general
                            framework of the summit with him in any event.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that one good way
                            to have a summit would be for <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> to head the delegation to the U.N. and then meet
                            the President in this context. I told him I would want to consult the
                            President on that and would let him know before he left.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the two most
                            fruitful subjects for a summit were <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss> and the Middle East. I said we, of course, were
                            interested in Vietnam. He replied that Vietnam could not be put on the
                            agenda for a summit, but it could certainly be discussed once the
                            parties got there. I suggested that he discuss the matter in Moscow and
                            we could then pursue the conversation after he returned. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> insisted that there was great
                            interest in a summit in the Soviet Union, and he was certain that our
                            talk would be well received by his superiors.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then showed me some
                            films of Siberia and of the Bolshoi Ballet. I left the Embassy about
                            midnight.</p>

                        <p>In brief, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated
                            Soviet willingness to resume bilateral talks and to meet U.S. wishes for
                            a more detailed formulation on the obligations of peace provided U.S.
                            will be more forthcoming on the question of withdrawal, particularly re
                            Sharm al-Shaykh, Gaza and Syria.</p>

                        <p>This was the meeting right after announcement of the U.S. decision on
                            Israel's arms requests. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> expressed concern over introduction of SAM–3's
                            into Egypt and stressed several times our concern over involvement of
                            additional Soviet personnel there. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> was “not in a position to comment.” He
                            maintained that U.S. expression of intent to maintain Israel's
                            superiority was not helpful to U.S.-Soviet efforts to achieve a peaceful
                            settlement; it would be better if the two sides were equal militarily.
                            The Secretary reminded <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            that Moscow had not responded to U.S. proposals for arms limitation
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>In replying to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            presentation of March 11, the Secretary made these points on the effort
                            to achieve a settlement: <list>
                                <item>—We have no objection in principle to resuming talks soon.
                                    Chances would be improved if the Soviet Union could provide
                                    beforehand certain clarifications of its position.</item>
                                <item>—In saying that it is prepared to meet the U.S. wish for
                                    greater detail on the question of peace, does the Soviet
                                    Government mean that it would accept Point 2 of our documents
                                    [where the obligations of peace are spelled out]?</item>
                                <item>—We have made our position on withdrawal clear. As concerns
                                    the UAR, we have said Israel should withdraw to the old
                                    international boundary. There must also be agreement between the
                                    parties on practical security arrangements in the Sharm
                                    al-Shaykh area. These arrangements would have to provide an
                                    absolute guarantee of free navigation through the Straits of
                                    Tiran. It is not our intention that they should call into
                                    question UAR sovereignty over Sharm al-Shaykh.</item>
                                <item>—Gaza is a special case since the question of sovereignty
                                    there has never been resolved. The pre-June 1967 situation,
                                    which the Soviet Union wants restored, was based on the
                                    Armistice of 1949, whereas we are now seeking peace.</item>
                                <item>—Does the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> still accept
                                    the language on the Rhodes formula agreed between the U.S. and
                                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> last September? If

                                    withdrawal from Gaza and Sharm al-Shaykh. <persName

                                    peace obligations. This has the effect of advancing Arab de jure

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> came in as we
                            had agreed at the dinner on April 7th, to get answers to two questions:
                            (1) whether we wanted the summit talks handled through a visit by
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to the United Nations
                            as Head of the Soviet Delegation, and (2) how we proposed to handle the
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks. In the latter
                            connection, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had told me
                            that it would help him if he could get some advance information so that
                            he could show that he is in direct and close contact on <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> matters with the White House.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> with respect to
                            the first question that if a summit meeting were to take place this
                            year, we would prefer to handle it outside <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472"
                                facs="0505"/>the United Nations and as a separate initiative. Of
                            course, we would not preclude the Soviet Prime Minister coming here but,
                            on the whole, we would like to take it as a separate initiative.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks, I told
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we would
                            present a very comprehensive proposal at Vienna, including qualitative
                            as well as quantitative restrictions. On the other hand, we did not
                            exclude a simple agreement this year. The best way to handle it would be
                            for the Vienna talks to concentrate on comprehensive measures, while he
                            and I would try to work out a limited agreement in the interval. One way
                            might be for a recess to be taken after a few months in Vienna, during
                            which time the President and the Soviet Prime Minister could break a
                            deadlock and then meet to ratify it at a summit. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood and he
                            would let me have an answer when he returned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then reverted to our
                            discussion of two days previously and asked me much the same question
                            about Vietnam that he had already asked. How did we propose to share
                            political power? Were we really willing to have a neutral government?
                            How did we visualize the political evolution? I told him that the
                            situation in Vietnam could only increase the complexity for all
                            countries, and that it would affect our attitude on many subjects,
                            including the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me about the
                            Middle East, again making the argument that we were not really pushing
                            as hard on the negotiations as we could. I said, “No, we, not the Soviet
                            Union, made the last proposals.” We were standing by our October 28th
                            position. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the
                            October 28th position is an old story, and we need a new position. I
                            told him that there was no sense debating the problem because the
                            situation was as follows: The President did not really require the
                            Jewish world since he had been elected largely without it and, in this
                            respect, he was freer than any other President. On the other hand, as
                            long as the war in Vietnam continued, he did not want to alienate people
                            with so much influence in the mass media. Therefore, the key to our
                            attitude on the Middle East would be found in the Soviet attitude toward
                            Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he
                            understood this, and he had in fact reported this to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>I then asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> about
                            possible changes in the Soviet leadership. He said he did not think any
                            were likely before the Party Congress, but that it was very probable
                            afterwards. He also reaffirmed that there had been no improvement in
                            Sino-Soviet relations.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The Soviet news agency <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> has issued a
                            formal statement (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Attached but not
                                printed.</note> on Cambodia. The statement is generally cautious in
                            tone, not committing the Soviets to any course of action but
                            demonstrating their continued interest in and concern about developments
                            in Southeast Asia. The statement does not explicitly repudiate the Lon
                            Nol Government; it makes no reference to Sihanouk. It makes no mention
                            of possible U.S. aid to Cambodia. It stands in marked contrast to the
                            tough statements emanating from Hanoi and Peking. Moreover, although it
                            expresses concern about the overall peaceful settlement of the problems
                            of Indo-China, it makes no references to the recent formation of the
                            “Indo-China Peoples' Front.” In fact its references to a peaceful
                            settlement “of the problems of Indo-China” might be a hint that the
                            Soviet Indo-China conference proposal is not entirely dead. The
                            difference in this Soviet statement and the Hanoi approach is
                            particularly striking because there have been recent conferences between
                            Hanoi Party First Secretary Le Duan and top Soviet officials in
                            Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_TASS1">TASS</gloss> statement leads (and ends) with
                            the following sentence: “It is believed in the Soviet Union that
                            attempts to undermine Cambodia's neutrality and widen imperialist
                            aggression in the Indo-China peninsula may have the most serious
                            consequences for the cause of peace and security in Southeast Asia.” The
                            statement then condemns at length the reported massacres in Cambodia; it
                            relates them to our policy of Vietnamization (allegedly setting Asians
                            against Asians) and claims that this “cannot but cause concern among
                            those who are interested in the earliest resolution of the dangerous
                            conflict and a peaceful settlement of the problems of Indo-China.”</p>

                                impression was that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                                had offered constructive new approaches to finding common ground on

                                ground was found it could be expressed in writing. Main question now
                                is how <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> envisages continuation of

                            <item>I pointed out that we had been extremely explicit on question of
                                main concern to Soviets—withdrawal—in our Oct 28 paper and now it
                                was Soviet turn to be explicit on peace, which was subject of major
                                concern to US and Israelis.</item>

                                frequently heard that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had gone
                                as far as it could in Oct 28 proposal. Such language frequently used
                                in negotiations but if US really means that its proposal is
                                nonnegotiable there is no point in further bilateral talks. He asked
                                specifically if US plan subject to modification, adding that answer
                                to this question was very important and would “help solve many
                                problems, including organizational problems of further work.”</item>

                            <item>I replied that I was obviously not prepared to discuss any
                                modification to our Oct 28 paper, especially since it was drafted to
                                take account of Soviet propositions on a number of issues and was
                                extremely explicit on withdrawal. US position is that we have been
                                very forthcoming and now it is Soviet turn to be specific on peace.
                                After studying <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0508"/>Soviet
                                language on peace and negotiations, we could then decide how far we

                                Soviets should be more specific at some time on peace, but said that
                                as US has tried to produce balanced peace plan from its point of
                                view, Soviet plan also balanced from its vantage point. “Frankly,”
                                he said, “Sov Gvt ready to negotiate, to continue bilateral talks,
                                to find workable solution which would satisfy all countries of
                                region as quickly as possible. Situation on ground getting worse
                                from point of view of both sides, and action necessary.” He
                                expressed hope that both sides can reach stage where something can
                                be submitted in writing (to four) but issue now was how to proceed
                                in bilaterals since <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>,

                            <item>As to procedure for next round of negotiations, I said that key
                                element would be Soviet readiness to produce written language

                                procedures to be adopted for talks would depend on who was
                                conducting them. He said that if he were participating he would
                                prefer to first identify all points of agreement and disagreement
                                orally, then would try to bridge existing gaps in further oral
                                discussions. After this, he would try to jointly formulate agreed
                                language on points at issue. He objected to the idea of exchanging
                                “artillery barrages of paper” which might prove unnecessary and have
                                the further effect of binding the participants to new positions, at
                                least for a time.</item>

                            <item>Speaking “off the record” <persName corresp="#p_VVM2"
                                    >Vinogradov</persName> criticized US Oct 28 position as a “good

                                vital issues such as Sharm, Gaza and security arrangements which
                                were left aside for “direct negotiations.” He claimed that although
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> “sold” its proposal nicely
                                it came as big surprise to Sov Gvt which hoped bilateral talks would
                                be marked by continuing progress forward rather than retrogression.
                                Before I could nail him on this he went on to say that
                                counter-accusations that the Soviets had reneged on Rhodes formula
                                were incorrect, since Soviets have not stepped back from it in
                                substance. Although Israelis destroyed viability of Rhodes formula,
                                Soviets still for flexible formula providing for negotiations

                            <item>I denied that our Oct 28 proposal represented a step backward in
                                any sense in the US position, pointing out that the idea of neutral
                                formulations to cover points where no agreement possible was a
                                concept Soviets accepted. Accusations of Soviet bad faith following
                                presentation of our Oct 28 paper were natural result of procedures
                                followed, where Soviets advanced many informal ideas orally which
                                evaporated later. In contrast, we produced our ideas in writing and
                                then married them to Soviet ideas in our Oct 28 paper. Later this
                                became “the American position” while the Soviet position on peace
                                and negotiations remains vague.</item>

                        <p>The Soviet Chargé, Vorontsov, called on me at his request at 3:30. He
                            handed me the attached note. I pointed out that it said nothing about
                            foreign troops in Cambodia. Vorontsov said the only foreign troops in
                            Cambodia that were confirmed were South Vietnamese. I said that in view
                            of his inadequate knowledge of Cambodia, there was no point in
                            continuing the conversation and that I hoped that if there were another
                            occasion to discuss Cambodia he would be better briefed.</p>

                                affairs of Cambodia. The enlargement of this interference in any
                                form could not but further complicate the situation in Indochina
                                area—which is dangerous enough even without that—and consequently

                                would be fully responsible.</p>
                            <p>Therefore Moscow hopes that President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"

                        <p>The consensus inside the government, and concurred in by some leading
                            scholars, seems to be that there has, in fact, been trouble in the
                            leadership, but that the resolution, if only temporary, has been in

                        <p>His image is sharper—as the result of intensive nation-wide television
                            exposure; his confidence is apparently reflected in his wide-ranging
                            speeches covering all important internal and external topics. And
                            several second level personnel changes, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of

                        <p>What is not clear, however, is the source of the trouble. One view is
                            that it has been <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s
                            doing: the result of the pointed attacks he launched last December
                            against the government's management of the economy. This theory is
                            documented mainly from material drawn from open sources.</p>

                            him to score some temporary gains. Others feel Shelepin was beaten in a

                        <p>Whatever the dispute over scenarios, there is hard evidence of three
                            politburo meetings between 24–27 March. About this time the violent
                            press campaign on the economic failures abated, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> emerged from his shell with
                            his television speeches. Some observers believe that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> was only able to win the day
                            by considerable compromise on his economic campaign—that is, by
                            softening the harsh, purge-like atmosphere he was generating.</p>
                        <p>The question remains whether <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>'s gain has been at the expense of collective
                            leadership in general, or only because of the weakening of some of the
                            stronger, more senior members of the politburo (<persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and Suslov). Many observers
                            believe that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> will
                            retire—honorably—and that this is part of the political play in

                            <p>—Finally, there was an amusing lapse by Andrei Kirilenko, a senior

                        <p>All of these suggest that there has been an unusual air of uncertainty

                        <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> employed some
                            harsh, denunciatory language in his press conference (May 4) <hi
                                rend="italic">but</hi> he made no new commitments, nor did he
                            foreshadow any major diplomatic action by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> to support Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>His main theme was that our actions in Cambodia would reverberate on both
                            US-Soviet relations and the “entire international situation.” He sought
                            to imply that other political issues would thus be affected: “What is
                            the worth of international agreements in which the United States is
                            taking part <hi rend="italic">or is going to take part</hi> if it
                            violates so unceremoniously the commitments it has assumed?” When asked,
                            however, if he meant to imply if the Soviet position in the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks would be broken off, he dodged
                            a direct reply and said they would be “on guard.”</p>
                        <p>In dealing with the immediate situation in Indo China, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s language was virulent, but he
                            stopped short on a number of key points. He did not commit the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to a new level of material aid, but
                            said that this would be “re-examined.” He referred to Sihanouk as the
                            “lawful head of state,” but only in the past tense. He termed the
                            fighting in Cambodia a “civil war,” but did not disavow the Lon Nol
                            government, or pledge Soviet support to Sihanouk, or the Indo China
                            People's Front.</p>
                        <p>He did appear, however, to rule out any international conference, though
                            this was in the context of the Indonesian effort. <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0514"/>Similarly, he evaded a direct reply on
                            whether the ICC should be reconstituted.</p>
                        <p>On one point, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> seems to
                            have gone further than other Communist statements: he claimed that the
                            bombing at North Vietnam “actually nullifies the decision of … President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> on the termination of
                            all air bombings …”<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">Ellipses in the source
                                text.</note> He did not spell out what actions, if any, this meant
                            for the Communist side.</p>
                        <p>There is little doubt that the Soviets have deliberately escalated their
                            rhetoric, in a rather dramatic way by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName>'s unique participation. One motive presumably
                            was not to be out-planked [flanked] on the left by the statements
                            simultaneously coming out of Hanoi, Peking, and Pyongyang.</p>
                        <p>But the content, stripped of its expected propaganda stridency, leaves
                            the Soviet position much the same as it was on the immediate issues in
                            Southeast Asia, with the possible exception of another backward step
                            away from an international conference.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Premier has set the stage for retaliatory political
                            action by linking our action in Cambodia with the general international
                            situation and implying an effect on the Soviet delegation position in
                            the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks.</p>
                        <p>I suspect that the Soviets are very uncertain what the effect of our
                            Cambodia action will be on the situation on the ground in Southeast
                            Asia. The Soviets may also be uneasy about our general posture toward
                            them, in light of the publicity for their increasingly dangerous
                            involvement in the Middle East. In these circumstances, the Soviet
                            leaders apparently are not about to underwrite a vast new Indo China
                            strategy, particularly if Chinese influence over Sihanouk and the new
                            Indo China Front is going to grow.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet aim seems to be to give a general warning without trying
                            themselves to any given course. They recognize, of course, that by
                            implying a wider effect of Cambodia on other international issues, they
                            can exploit concern in this country.</p>
                        <p>It appears uncertain whether the Soviets intend to withdraw from the
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks. It might seem an
                            attractive way to exploit US domestic reaction but their interests in
                            these talks go beyond the immediate problems of Southeast Asia. It seems
                            more likely that the Soviets will downgrade the talks, and try to use
                            the events in Southeast Asia as a means to make new overtures to the
                            Europeans, trying to split our Allies (e.g., France) from the United
                            States. Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> noted in
                            this press conference that the events in Cambodia made a European
                            Security conference all the more necessary.</p>

                                have made it clear that the objective is not only harassment of the
                                Soviets, but sustained pressure through covert means to induce on
                                their part a more cooperative posture on international issues of
                                vital importance to the U.S. Government. This is to be done by
                                exacerbating their sensitivities both within the <gloss

                                abroad in areas where the Soviet presence or interests are
                                significant political factors. The over-all program, however, is not
                                to be limited to short-term impact operations. We will also give
                                careful thought to corresponding action efforts of a long-term and
                                positive nature, aimed at neutralizing Soviet covert political
                                operations in important “third countries.” In addition to stepping
                                up the pace of their current operations, I have asked our stations
                                to give us their best thinking and ideas for new programs. To date,
                                we have received detailed and thoughtful responses [<hi

                                and it seems to me that the majority of our operational approaches
                                will be concentrated in a number of sensitive zones where we believe
                                the Soviets are particularly susceptible to covert action
                                exploitation. These include the following: <list>

                        <p>At the outset of the meeting, the Secretary asked about <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s health. The Ambassador said
                            he felt good.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he understood that
                            the meeting this afternoon would focus on the Middle East. Nevertheless,
                            he was prepared to discuss other matters, such as European affairs and
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, in the future at the
                            Secretary's convenience.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he had been
                            authorized during his recent consultation in Moscow to inform the U.S.
                            Government that he was prepared to continue discussions on the Middle
                            East with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>. He hoped
                            that mutual efforts would lead to a solution. The Soviet <pb n="485"
                                xml:id="pg_485" facs="0518"/>Government was also interested in
                            finding guidelines which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> could use in the search for a settlement on the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then referred to his
                            conversations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            prior to the latter's trip to the Middle East. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted that the U.S. side had
                            expressed an interest during those talks in obtaining more detailed
                            formulations on the nature of peace and the obligations which the sides
                            would undertake. At the same time, the Soviet side had indicated an
                            interest in more precise language from the U.S. on the question of
                            withdrawal and other matters. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said he was instructed to present formulations
                            on the two points mentioned and that he hoped these points would meet
                            the wishes of the U.S. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            then handed the Secretary two papers with the following formulations

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that these two
                            formulations along with others they had presented to <persName

                            together. In any event, he expressed the hope that they would remain
                            confidential. The Soviet side looks forward toward movement from the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>Commenting that we would look at the two formulations carefully, the
                            Secretary then recalled his conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of March 25,<note n="2"

                            <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0519"/>at which time he had noted that
                            the U.S. found the operational involvement of Soviet military personnel
                            in the UAR defenses to be serious and potentially dangerous. The
                            Secretary noted that in reply <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had expressed the view that Soviet actions were
                            of a defensive nature and that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had expressed the hope that the U.S. would be
                            of some assistance in getting the Israelis to desist from
                            deep-penetration raids. Since that conversation, the Secretary noted
                            Israel has halted the deep-penetration raids and Israeli representatives
                            have publicly stated that Israel would observe a cease-fire. In
                            addition, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName> has
                            publicly accepted, during a speech in the Knesset, Security Council
                            Resolution 242. The Secretary said that Israel's position on
                            deep-penetration raids was announced by Israeli Defense Minister Dayan
                            on May 4. Subsequently, on May 26, Dayan went further by indicating that
                            Israeli air activity was being limited to an area 30 kilometers west of
                            the Canal. These moves on the part of Israel represented real progress,
                            and we feel that we have been helpful in this context by urging Israel
                            to cease its deep-penetration raids. Furthermore, in our view, Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>'s acceptance of
                            Security Council Resolution 242 provides a basis for negotiations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the U.S. remained deeply concerned over the
                            increased military involvement of the Soviet Union in the UAR. In view
                            of this concern he wished to convey a statement,<note n="3"

                                    Soviet military activities in the UAR will remain defensive. We
                                    want to make clear that we would not view the introduction of
                                    Soviet personnel, by air or on the ground, in the Canal combat
                                    zone as defensive since such action could only be in support of
                                    the announced UAR policy of violating the cease-fire resolutions
                                    of the Security Council. We believe that introduction of Soviet
                                    military personnel into the delicate Suez Canal combat zone
                                    could lead to serious escalation with unpredictable consequences
                                    to which the U.S. could not remain indifferent. In this
                                    connection, we believe, and I am sure you do, it is neither in
                                    the interest of the Soviet Union nor the United States for the
                                    Middle East to become an area of confrontation between us.”</p>

                        <p>The Secretary then noted that the Soviet Union had at one point indicated
                            an interest in a cease-fire in the area. The U.S. side would like to
                            renew discussions on this subject with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> as well as on the general matter of a Middle

                            desirable. We welcome the written formulations provided by the
                            Ambassador and are willing to resume bilateral discussions very

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> noted that the U.S. side
                            would wish a bit of time to review the new formulations and to consider
                            them in the light of papers that had been exchanged previously.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> emphasized that the
                            formula on mutual obligations should be kept very confidential. He had
                            no particular problem regarding publicity surrounding meetings but did
                            hope that the substance of the proposals advanced during conversations
                            would not be revealed publicly. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> noted further that he had no objections to
                            having the fact revealed that new proposals were advanced, so long as
                            the substance was not disclosed. He warned that if the proposals were
                            leaked, the Soviets would not feel bound by them. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> suggested that any public
                            disclosure that new formulations had been advanced would only arouse
                            curiosity and could lead to unwarranted speculation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, therefore, suggested that
                            nothing be said publicly on this score. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            whether he could provide any clarification regarding the Soviet Union's
                            intentions with respect to Soviet personnel and military equipment in
                            the UAR. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that he
                            was not qualified to discuss “military details.” He referred to the
                            Dayan statements regarding penetration raids and wondered whether these
                            represented personal comments or whether they were sanctioned by the
                            Government of Israel.</p>
                        <p>Alluding to the Secretary's remarks, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that the only thing that has happened in
                            the Middle East is that deep-penetration into UAR air space and
                            bombardment of heavily populated Egyptian areas by Israel have ceased.
                            This is the only thing which has really changed in the Middle East. He
                            added that the outlook for the Middle East was not very hopeful if U.S.
                            policy was aimed at maintaining Israel's military superiority and
                            Israel's policy of dealing from a position of strength. If, on the other
                            hand, the U.S. wants to find a solution that would be fair to both
                            Israel and the Arab countries, the Soviet Union would be willing to
                            cooperate. Frankly, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said, maybe the situation now is a little more equal in the military
                            sense. Perhaps this provides a good opportunity to advance toward a
                            settlement. The Soviet Union feels that the time may be ripe. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed that the Soviet Union
                            does not feel that anything has happened in the way of a developing
                            confrontation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. He wanted to assure
                            the Secretary that the Soviet Union does not want such a confrontation,
                            even though he claimed that some forces in the world and pro-Zionist
                            forces in the U.S. would like this to happen. <persName

                            nothing has changed drastically in the situation, looking at it coolly
                            and realistically. A possibility for a peaceful settlement still exists,
                            and there is no doubt from the Soviet side with respect to not wanting a
                            confrontation.</p>
                        <p>In reply to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the
                            Secretary said there should be no doubt that the U.S. wanted a fair and
                            equitable solution. Our formulations of December 9<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d159fn4">See <ref target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note>
                            indicated that. These proposals were unacceptable to Israel, and the UAR
                            had not accepted the proposals either. With respect to other comments by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the Secretary said
                            that we felt strongly that a shift in the military situation had taken
                            place. It is conceivable that the Arabs, having felt deeply humiliated
                            in the past, may be in a better frame of mind now. The basic question,
                            however, is whether the Soviet Union and the Arabs really want a
                            peaceful settlement. We feel that we should actively pursue a political
                            solution. The Secretary underlined that any additional actions by the
                            Soviet Union, especially toward the Suez Canal, could be highly
                            explosive and that is why we felt it necessary to make the statement
                            that we did. We believe that the time is ripe to work toward a peaceful
                            settlement and we will work actively toward this end. The Secretary said
                            that he could not think of anything that would be more helpful in
                            improving the world atmosphere at the moment than a peaceful settlement
                            in the Middle East. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that Israel's actions and statements over the
                            past weeks were not totally apart from what we have done in urging
                            Israel to be more flexible in its positions. In addition to the
                            statements and actions he had already referred to, the Secretary cited
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EA3">Eban</persName>'s comment
                            that the world would be surprised at the concessions that Israel would
                            make once genuine negotiations got underway. We have not seen anything
                            similarly forthcoming from <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                            >Nasser</persName>'s side, however. The Secretary said that he hoped the
                            Soviet Union would impress upon the Arabs the importance of a
                            settlement. Otherwise, it can be seen that the fedayeen would become
                            more and more a factor in the situation and unlikely to be subject to
                            the influence of others.</p>

                            and that we hoped the Soviet Union would give serious consideration to

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joe Sisco</persName> came up and, in the
                            course of some banter about whether or not this would be a busy summer,
                            said that the Soviets should recognize that large Congressional
                            majorities could still be mustered for anti-Soviet positions.
                            Specifically, he said, that the 76 [<hi rend="italic">73</hi>]

                            Israel did so out of a deep concern over Soviet actions. It did not take
                            much to arouse this country against the Soviets if a threat to our
                            interests was sensed. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said
                            that this ready reservoir of popular US anti-Soviet sentiment could well
                            make life more difficult for both our governments.</p>
                        <p>Vorontsov said the Israelis were trying to get the US and the Soviets
                            embroiled with each other and were responsible for the Congressional
                            actions. In Soviet judgment, most Americans understood the policies of
                            confrontation could not accomplish anything vis-à-vis the Soviets, who
                            could not be intimidated. Most US people wanted the US to keep its hands
                            off in the Middle East and elsewhere. Only the Israelis and a few
                            Americans were picturing the Middle East conflict as one between the
                            Soviet Goliath and the Israeli David.</p>
                        <p>I said that Vorontsov should not underrate the suspicion of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that remains among many Americans,
                            even if it seems now to be largely beneath the surface. Americans were
                            still capable of being aroused by Soviet efforts to damage our
                            interests. It was a mistake to think that the Israelis alone were
                            responsible for pressures on the Phantoms or for our concern about
                            Soviet conduct in the Middle East.</p>

                        <p>The President convened the meeting at 12:05. He introduced the meeting by
                            pointing out that he was to have a National Security Council meeting
                            sometime in the following week.<note n="2" xml:id="d161fn2">See <ref

                                    event.</item>
                                <item>—The President pointed out that the Board should be aware that
                                    Arab moderates could be inclined to lean in the direction of the
                                    United States due to the Soviet aggressiveness.</item>
                                <item>—The Arab moderates obviously do not want the balance of power
                                    to shift them.</item>
                                <item>—It is difficult to maintain a balance in the Middle East with
                                    the introduction of Soviet combat personnel into Egypt. The
                                    President pointed out that some maintained position that we
                                    should do nothing. But if we do nothing the Israelis may be
                                    forced to act. Also, it is apparent that there will be no
                                    settlement without U.S. and Soviet agreement. This may be
                                    possible sooner or later. If we wait for later, then the
                                    President visualizes some flash point with great dangers which
                                    might then ultimately result in agreement. The Soviets on the
                                    other hand probably are delighted with a status quo since they
                                    are exploiting it with greatly increased influence.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>The President also pointed out that the Soviets fear the fedayeen just as
                            does <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. However, on balance,
                            to the degree that we line up solidly with Israel, the Soviets acquire
                            support from the other elements by default. Finally, the President
                            emphasized that the main danger today is that Israel may move militarily
                            and that we will be looking <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0525"
                            />down the barrels with the Soviet Union again. On balance, the
                            President believes that if there is to be a settlement, it must be
                            imposed. It would be a settlement which would be not to the liking of
                            either Israel or the Arabs. It is really a question of the degree of
                            dissatisfaction shared by both. For this reason, the U.S. and the
                            Soviets must talk, but at a time and under circumstances in which the
                            Soviets feel it is in their interest to do so. They do not feel this way
                            at present. So we must keep them worried about the Middle East. The
                            President emphasized that he had no domestic political problem on this
                            issue and it would be influenced only by the national interests. At
                            present, he feels that it is necessary that we put Israel in a position
                            that they can be a serious worry to the Soviets. The President added
                            that the U.S. has no illusions about Four Power or Israeli/<persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> talks. The only solution would
                            be one imposed by both the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MF3">Franklin Murphy</persName> stated that the
                            Arabs feel that the loss of oil is a deterrent to the United States and
                            its actions with respect to Israel. He wondered whether or not we were
                            studying the implications of what it would mean to lose Middle East oil.
                            The President replied that this would be a serious turn of events,
                            especially from Europe's point. On the other hand, the President pointed
                            out the Arab oil producers cannot drink their oil and must have a
                            market. This was the issue in Iran some years ago.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MF3">Franklin Murphy</persName> then added: Isn't
                            there a wheel within a wheel. Without the benefits and revenues from the
                            oil in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the fedayeen movement would
                            collapse. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> added
                            that the fedayeen movement was fundamentally subsidized by the moderate
                            Arabs, as well as some Soviet support.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Robert Murphy</persName> stated if we
                            examine the Middle East issue in depth, I feel that what you have said
                            will be largely verified. The President replied: Yes, this indicates
                            that the oil problem is not quite so bad as frequently depicted, and
                            that in any event the Arabs must sell their oil.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_AGWJ1">Anderson</persName> stated that it
                            is also important that we, the United States, do not get isolated on
                            this issue and that we keep our moderate Arab friends with us. The
                            President agreed that this is necessary on the surface at any rate.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName>Rockefeller</persName> stated that as we look down the
                            road, we can see the Soviets behind all the problems in the Middle East
                            and he wondered whether or not they could absorb all of the Middle
                            East's oil.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MF3">Franklin Murphy</persName> stated that while
                            these are the realities of the Middle East situation, the evidence is
                            that the Soviet's role in the Middle East is not understood in the
                            Moslem world and they view it as strictly an anti-Israeli problem. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that the
                            Moslems worry about the Soviet Union on entirely different grounds.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD2">Robert Murphy</persName> stated that he
                            believed that on balance the Soviets do not <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493"
                                facs="0526"/>enjoy that much prestige in the Middle East among the
                            Arab nations. The President interrupted, nevertheless the wheels
                            continue to turn. He wants to consider this issue on the 16th of June
                            with the view of deciding where we go from here.</p>

                            the obligations which the Arabs and Israelis would undertake. At the

                        <p>The new formulations must be viewed against the background of the recent
                            history of our dialogue with the Soviets on a Middle East settlement
                            (see Tab B<note n="4" xml:id="d162fn4">Tab B is printed as <ref

                            to resume bilateral talks and to meet U.S. wishes for more detailed
                            formulations on the obligations of peace <hi rend="italic">provided</hi>
                            we would be more forthcoming on the issue of withdrawal, particularly
                            regarding Sharm al-Shaikh, Gaza and Syria. He also said the <gloss

                            provisions in its plan on the cessation of the state of war by a
                            provision on establishing, as a result of settlement, a state of peace.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was not, however,
                            addressing himself <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0528"/>directly to

                            1969 proposals.</p>
                        <p>Before <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> returned to
                            Moscow, he had three other meetings at State on the Middle East—another
                            session in late March with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> which completed setting the stage for two
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>– <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> meetings on April 1 and 6.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> made it clear
                            that we were unwilling to go beyond our earlier proposals (the October
                            28 document on the UAR and the December 18 proposals on the Jordan
                            aspect), although we had no objection to resuming the bilateral talks.
                            Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s talks
                            with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> were not very
                            fruitful, although the door was left open to further discussions.
                            Essentially, they reviewed the state of play, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made clear he had instructions
                            to talk only from the Soviet June 1969 paper.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is possible to see, as <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            does, a “slight advance” over their earlier positions. The caveat should
                            be quickly added, however, that this may be highly illusionary. The
                            Soviets have made an apparent concession on one key issue—Arab control
                            of the fedayeen—but seem to have retrogressed in other important areas
                            since last March. On balance, therefore, it may be that there is really
                            no net movement in our favor.</p>
                        <p>On the positive side, the Soviets, after many months of pressure from us,
                            have finally agreed in effect to the principle of the Arab governments
                            assuming the obligation to control the fedayeen after a settlement. This
                            has been a key issue for us because there is virtually no chance of
                            bringing the Israelis along without such an Arab commitment. They have
                            also given us half a loaf on the juridical timing of peace by saying now
                            that a formal state of peace can come into effect after completion of
                            the first stage of withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>On the negative side, the Soviets, by talking about modifications in
                            their June document, seem to be wiping the slate clean of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s Moscow talks last July and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>' New York talks
                            in September which provided the basis for our October 28 document. In
                            effect, they are still rejecting our total package in favor of building
                            on their initial, and to us unacceptable, approach of a year ago. In
                            fact, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s comment that the
                            two new formulations on peace would stand or fall together with “others”
                            that had been presented to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            has a somewhat negative ring.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets seem to have raised other new barriers to progress. Their
                            continuing insistence on obtaining more precise language from us on the
                            question of withdrawal is probably the best example. In the Four Power
                            talks they have made total withdrawal without any border <pb n="496"
                                xml:id="pg_496" facs="0529"/>rectifications the condition for any
                            further movement and they seem to be implying the same in our bilateral
                            dialogue. At a minimum they want us to fill in the gaps such as Gaza,
                            Jerusalem, Sharm al-Sheikh that we have so far left to the parties to
                            negotiate. There is yet to be a satisfactory response from the Soviets
                            on how the parties will negotiate, since they apparently wrote off the
                            Rhodes formula last March.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>On the whole it is difficult to hold out much hope for progress in the
                            bilateral talks with the Soviets. They seem to be following a game plan
                            that gives us just enough bait to remain interested while they try to
                            sell us a position based on maximum Arab demands. For instance, the Arab
                            commitment to control the fedayeen is important to us and the Israelis,
                            but it hardly matches with our agreeing to spell out more on the
                            withdrawal issue. Acceptance of control over the fedayeen is an
                            important concession from the Soviets and Arabs but withdrawal is the
                            foundation of the entire Israeli position.</p>
                        <p>The interesting question to ask, however, is: Does Moscow want these
                            talks more than we do? It would seem to me that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has a greater interest than we do in
                            talking just for the sake of talking. They want to preserve the image of
                            reasonableness while they help the Egyptians militarily and benefit from
                            the deteriorating situation on the ground. Also, <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> seems to want to keep the
                            negotiating option open and it would be difficult for the Soviets to cut
                            him off. Our main interest is in real progress toward a settlement. We
                            have some interest in looking reasonable too, but in present
                            circumstances we are billed as the obstacle to progress, so the talks do
                            not provide much in that regard. They could be broken off <hi

                        <p>Any decision made on the Middle East necessarily involves some basic
                            assumptions about the character of the Soviet position.</p>
                        <p>The point is correctly made that had it not been for the deep penetration
                            raids the Soviets would not have involved themselves directly. This is
                            probably right. The Soviets had no master plan. We have the hardest
                            possible intelligence that the decisions leading to the present
                            situation were approved by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> on January 28–29, in the wake of <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s secret visit to Moscow. The
                            Soviets had no choice but to support <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName>, and strong moves were obviously called for.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, it is highly irrelevant to our present policy choices
                            whether the Israelis are at fault. The character of the Soviet move into
                            the UAR should not be underrated simply because Israeli action
                            precipitated it.</p>
                        <p>It is a unique turn of Soviet policy—never before have the Soviets put
                            their own forces in combat jeopardy for the sake of a noncommunist
                            government. They have only done so now because of the enormous stakes
                            involved for their power position. One of the dangerous consequences of
                            their forward policy in the Middle East is that having accumulated a
                            large vested interest, they have had to devise new ways to protect their
                            gains. It is not only a question of Soviet willingness to accept a much
                            higher level of risk, it is their willingness to do so in a situation
                            over which their control is limited, and in which no one, including the
                            Kremlin, can foresee the outcome. This is why it is a dangerous path the
                            Soviets have embarked on, and why we must treat it with the utmost
                            seriousness.</p>
                        <p>It is argued that now [that] the Soviets have rescued <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> both of them may suddenly change
                            their spots, and be prepared to negotiate seriously. This is to say the
                            least, doubtful. Having scored an immense psychological gain, with
                            apparent impunity, it has generally <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498"
                                facs="0531"/>been the Russians tactic first of all to consolidate
                            their gains, and then press forward, testing the ground as they move.
                            Clearly, there is no evidence from the Soviets that their bargaining
                            position has softened. To seize on minor changes in old Soviet formulas
                            as “movement” is a delusion. If anything, the Soviet position is tougher
                            now than only a few weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>The toughening can only spring from their estimate of what their moves
                            have cost thus far and what the future risks and gains are. Looking at
                            our position and the Israeli standdown from deep raids, the Soviets must
                            conclude that we have acquiesced in their direct intervention. Indeed,
                            they could well read our latest statement (<persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>)<note n="2" xml:id="d163fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> as confirmation that
                            we accept the Soviet claim of “defensive” involvement, and are only
                            concerned that a movement toward the canal would not be “defensive.”</p>
                        <p>Thus, the question of whether the Soviets will in fact, begin to inch
                            forward becomes a crucial determinant. The policy issue is: are the
                            Soviets more likely to extend their protective umbrella if we proceed
                            with the sale of aircraft to Israel, or if we withhold them?</p>
                        <p>The conventional wisdom is that the Soviets will probably not move,
                            mainly because of the risk of combat with the Israelis. There is,
                            however, some evidence that they are indeed already “inching” forward
                            (the construction sites along the canal). Moreover, it would seem a
                            logical extension of Soviet strategy to do so. The near term Soviet
                            objective in the Middle East is to destroy Western influence. The main
                            enemy is not Israel but the West in general and the United States in
                            particular. The road to the displacement of the West, however, now lies
                            through Soviet demonstration that they cannot only protect their
                            clients, but reverse the losses they suffered in 1967.</p>
                        <p>One means of doing so is to negotiate a settlement. But this presumes
                            that the Soviets prefer a stabilized situation to one of controlled
                            tensions. The history of Soviet involvement demonstrates that their
                            major gains have come during periods of tension and crises, and that
                            during periods of relative quiet on the Arab-Israeli front, Soviet
                            influence suffers. Thus, there is every reason to doubt that the Soviets
                            want a settlement on any terms but Israeli capitulation, unless the
                            Arabs themselves are prepared to make the concessions.</p>
                        <p>The means to humiliate Israel and force their withdrawal is first of all
                            to demonstrate that Israel has waning international support and, of
                            utmost importance, waning support from the US. Second, the Soviets and
                            the Arabs must demonstrate in practice that Israel's options are
                            gradually but steadily narrowing.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>The Soviets could conclude that the present situation represents a
                            sufficient gain to test the possibilities of discussion with us. Their
                            opening moves in New York and in the conversation with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> do not support such a
                            conclusion. Indeed, the two and four power talks seem a dismal failure.
                            Thus, one suspects that the key to the next phase is our reaction on the
                            ground. If we do nothing or very little to support Israel, the Soviets
                            will then be tempted to cut a further slice of the salami and inch
                            forward to the canal. If, however, we support Israel the Soviets will be
                            forced to pause and consider the consequences of their increasing
                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>As for the argument that this is exactly what the Soviets want us to do
                            because it will demolish our position in the Arab world, this also is
                            debatable if not altogether wrong. (It is made exclusively by Arabs and
                            not Sovietologists.) The Soviets respect power and strength. They
                            understand military strength best of all. This does not mean, of course,
                            that they are eager to fight, or that they believe in the indiscriminate
                            use of force. But they do not understand restraint; it confuses them,
                            and in the end leads them to conclude that there is room for their own
                            forward movement.</p>
                        <p>If the United States does not support Israel demonstratively with
                            military assistance, the Soviets will ponder why we refuse to do so.
                            Ultimately, they will conclude that we are deterred because of either
                            domestic, political and economic concerns or because of the consequences
                            of military escalation. Soviet denials, talk of confrontation and their
                            attempts to blame Israel for such notions suggest sensitivity (and
                            vulnerability) to strong US moves. No one can <hi rend="italic"
                                >guarantee</hi> what the Soviets will do if we do reinforce Israel
                            but one can be fairly confident that a display of weakness will not be
                            met with conciliation and compromise.</p>

                        <p>The two strategies presented in the first Review Group paper in effect
                            reject this analysis. The essential judgment as presented in that paper
                            is that it is preferable to exploit the present situation to put Israel
                            under pressure, than to “confront” the Soviet Union. And that if this
                            fails we can always confront Moscow.</p>

                            cannot but agree.</p>
                        <p>No one should want to confront the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            deliberately in the way it is described in the State paper. It would be
                            insane. For example, having decided on some undefined posture of
                            “confrontation” we close off all escape hatches for the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by breaking off the diplomatic
                            contact.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of aimless military “moves” described. The only
                            principle seems to be that to move pieces on a chess board is a <pb
                                n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0533"/>policy. What would the Soviets
                            conclude? That we were about to fight? Not likely. More likely that we
                            were engaging in some bluff. What would be the objective of military
                            posturing? What would our demands be? They are nowhere spelled out. Are
                            we seeking Soviet withdrawal? A settlement? Or, as is seen from this
                            scenario, a whopping open-ended crisis.</p>
                        <p>One can only conclude that this course was described in such a way as to
                            increase the attractiveness of the second strategy—the “path of
                            accommodation.”</p>
                        <p>Presumably, no one opposes the “path of accommodation” but how to embark
                            on such a course is the real issue. The paper presumes that putting
                            Israel under pressure is the best way. Suppose, by some wild stretch of
                            the imagination, that Israel buckled under our pressures. Would a
                            compromise settlement then be likely? If the Arabs and the Russians
                            sense this trend why should they make concessions. Better to wait, they
                            would reason.</p>
                        <p>Our aim should not be an imposed settlement, which could not possibly be
                            durable, but one that emerges from the common interests of both sides.
                            This is a cliché, but still valid. The course described in the State
                            paper, however, could only feed Arab ambitions and frustrate the Israeli
                            to the point of desperation.</p>
                        <p>The immediate task is to create a political-military environment that
                            provides an incentive to both sides to either stabilize the present
                            situation or make mutual concessions.</p>
                        <p>This leads to the main point. It is mandatory to the creation of such an
                            environment that we counter the Soviet intervention with a credible
                            demonstration of our own—a demonstration that we are not cowed by the
                            prospect of escalation or by the costs to our political and economic
                            interests in the Arab countries.</p>
                        <p>Warnings alone are not enough. Indeed, since we have presented several
                            serious warnings, the more we present the less credible. Breaking off
                            contacts serves no end, and moving military forces is at least premature
                            (the Pueblo fiasco should demonstrate the futility of moving aircraft
                            carriers and airplanes that we do not intend to use).</p>
                        <p>Because the dispatch of aircraft to Israel has become the symbol for
                            measuring our policy, it has, perhaps unfortunately, become the only
                            immediate issue.</p>
                        <p>Only <hi rend="italic">after</hi> demonstrating our willingness to take
                            up this option can we expect to convince Israel of the need to make some
                            political concession and convince the Soviets and Arabs that we are not
                            deterred by their recent actions.</p>
                        <p>How many planes [and] in what sequence are secondary issues which should
                            not obscure the primary challenge of the Soviets. The <pb n="501"
                                xml:id="pg_501" facs="0534"/>announced basis for such a move should
                            be that the Soviets by their direct involvement have threatened the
                            military balance, that we have failed to receive a satisfactory
                            explanation of their aims or reassurance of their intention.
                            Accordingly, we are committed to maintain the position of Israel.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We have learned that a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, N.P. Firyubin, is
                            coming to New York next week to “visit” the Soviet UN Mission and confer
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName>. The
                            interesting aspect is that Firyubin's area of substantive responsibility
                            includes Southeast Asia. Moreover, visits by Soviet deputy foreign
                            ministers to the UN (when little is happening there currently) are not
                            usual, although Firyubin may be filling in for First Deputy Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KVV2">Kuznetsov</persName> who normally
                            supervises Soviet UN activities but is currently tied up in negotiations
                            with the Chinese. With the next UN General Assembly being a special one
                            in view of the 25th anniversary, Soviet planning for it may be more than
                            routine and might include a trip here by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName>. Other heads of government are planning to
                            attend. It is quite likely, however, that Firyubin's purpose may not
                            only be to talk with <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> on UN
                            matters, but to make himself available for contacts with us. Any such
                            contacts, in view of his responsibilities, would logically focus on
                            Cambodia, Laos or Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>He could simply be on a fishing expedition to gain first hand a better
                            insight into our policies and future moves. If Firyubin has some special
                            message he will undoubtedly take the initiative to let us know.</p>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0535"/>
                        <p>Whether this trip could involve an important political break in the
                            Communist position on Indochina is simply not predictable. On the
                            record, it seems unlikely that the Soviets are in a position to take any
                            major initiative at this time because of their more complicated
                            relations with Hanoi and Peking. It seems likely that the Soviets,
                            therefore, are acting on their own.</p>
                        <p>They may have in mind, however, testing our reaction to some future moves
                            on the negotiating front, including the possibility of a new
                            international conference or the re-establishment of the ICC in
                            Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>Our Embassy in Moscow speculates that Firyubin will sound out <persName
                                corresp="#p_UT1">U Thant</persName> and interested states on
                            Cambodia, in anticipation of <persName corresp="#p_UT1">U
                                Thant</persName>'s trip to Moscow in mid-June.</p>
                        <p>It is also worth recalling that <persName corresp="#p_MYA1"
                                >Malik</persName> has played a key role in breaking two crises (in
                            1949 and 1953). This was remembered at the time of his trial balloon on
                            an Indochina conference in April. Perhaps Firyubin wishes to discuss
                            some new scenario with <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName> and
                            insure a better coordination with Moscow.</p>
                        <p>In short, we cannot be at all sure what is up. It does seem that this is
                            no routine visit and the Soviets may be probing for some new contacts or
                            testing the ground for future moves on the Southeast Asia front. Some
                            light might be shed on the Soviet position when we learn the details of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s discussion on
                            Indochina during his current Paris visit.<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">

                                but apparently never sent, the Secretary described <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s visit as follows:
                                “Although <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>'s visit was
                                useful to the French in calling attention to their role as an
                                independent major power, it yielded nothing new on the substantive
                                side and disappointed them in some respects. The problem was the
                                Soviets' unwillingness to make concessions these days, even to
                                please friends like the French. Additionally, if some reports can be
                                credited, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> was not
                                very adept at sugar-coating the unpalatable pills he dispensed to
                                his French hosts.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_RG1">RG</gloss> 59,

                            of peace will begin when the “first stage” of Israeli withdrawal is

                        <p>What most strikes me after completing this review is how little real
                            progress we have made after 15 months of talking with the Soviets <pb
                                n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0539"/>on the Middle East. For all
                            practical purposes, we are now effectively back to where we began when
                            the Soviets presented their working document to us in June 1969. After
                            actively discussing a joint document between June 17—when they produced
                            their draft—and September 30, the Soviets in December simply turned
                            aside our October 28 formulations—containing a major concession from us
                            on boundaries—as providing no basis for a joint document.</p>
                        <p>Now they have reopened the dialogue with a concession to us—Arab control
                            of the fedayeen—but have linked it to our being even more forthcoming on
                            the withdrawal issue (in effect asking us to bargain away all of
                            Israel's position). Moreover, by continuing to insist on talking only
                            about modifications in their June documents, the Soviets seem to be
                            wiping the slate clean of <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s
                            Moscow talks last July<note n="8" xml:id="d165fn8">See <ref

                                xml:id="d165fn9">See <ref target="#d81">Documents 81</ref> and <ref
                                    target="#d87">87</ref>.</note> which provided the basis for our
                            October 28 document.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this there are a number of important issues on which the Soviets
                            have either retrogressed (negotiating procedures, withdrawal, nature of
                            agreement), held firm (waterways, refugees, demilitarized zones) or not
                            moved enough on to make any real difference (timing of withdrawal,
                            juridical state of peace).</p>
                        <p>It is hard to escape the conclusion that the Soviets are not negotiating
                            in good faith with us. They seem to be too content with the present
                            situation on the ground and our difficulties in the area to back down
                            much from the maximum Arab demands. This has taken place when—as a
                            review of the above positions shows—we might well reach agreement if
                            they would take as much distance from the Arab position as we have taken
                            from Israel's. Yet we have no evidence that the Soviets intend to do
                            this.</p>
                        <p>If this is a valid interpretation, the logical question then arises as to
                            why the Soviets seem intent on keeping up a dialogue on the Middle East.
                            It may be that they view the bilateral talks as a potential escape hatch
                            if the situation on the ground begins to get out of hand and their
                            commitments to the Arabs start them down the road to a confrontation
                            with us and Israel. They are after all playing a dangerous game with
                            their SA–3s and pilots. It may also be that the Soviets view their talks
                            with us as a way of keeping us a bit off guard as their military
                            presence increases in the area and as a potential safeguard against some
                            precipitate act by us to reverse the situation. Finally, there is the
                            apparent fact that <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> still
                            wants to keep the political settlement option open and the Soviets would
                            rather do his bidding than let him alone with us.</p>

                        <p>On June 10, 1970, the National Security Council met from 9:36–11:24 a.m.
                            to discuss the Middle East. In an unsigned and undated memorandum for
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> about issues for
                            the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Henry Kissinger</persName>, the
                            President's Assistant for National Security Affairs, described the
                            “implications of the Soviet presence in Egypt”:</p>
                        <p>“The character of the Soviet move in the UAR should not be
                            underrated.</p>
                        <p>“You may hear the argument made (by Defense) that this move was
                            precipitated by Israeli action or that it is purely defensive and does
                            not threaten Israel. These arguments do not meet the main point: This is
                            a unique turn of Soviet policy—never before have the Soviets put their
                            own forces in combat jeopardy for the sake of a non-Communist
                            government.</p>
                        <p>“It is argued that now the Soviets have rescued <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> both of them may suddenly change
                            character and be prepared to negotiate seriously. This seems doubtful.
                            Having scored a psychological gain with apparent impunity, it has
                            generally been the Soviet tactic first to consolidate their gains and
                            then to press forward, testing the ground as they move.</p>
                        <p>“The problem, therefore, is not simply that the Soviet military presence
                            may have, at a minimum, limited Israeli military options. The problem is
                            that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has established a new
                            kind of foothold in the UAR and the U.S. has a strong interest in

                                <p>“1. The Israeli view is that if Israel and the U.S. will only
                                    stand fast, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the
                                    Arabs will decide to negotiate. This means that the U.S. must
                                    give Israel all the equipment it needs and make no concessions
                                    to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>“The problem with this is that the Israelis have not really

                                    consider accepting. So the Arabs feel they have no choice but to
                                    fight. Thus the U.S. is left backing Israel in a war of
                                    attrition that seems likely to lead only to another war—probably

                                    over-extended and has every interest in avoiding involvement in
                                    the Mid-East. Besides, the Arab-Israeli problem is not
                                    susceptible of military solution.</p>
                                <p>“The problems with this view are that: (a) If the U.S. shows that
                                    it does not have enough interest in the Mid-East to warrant a

                                    UAR purely in a defensive capacity and that the U.S., therefore,
                                    need not be concerned because the Soviets will not threaten
                                    Israel.</p>

                                    The near term Soviet objective in the Middle East is to destroy
                                    Western influence. The main enemy is not Israel but the West in
                                    general and the U.S. in particular. Therefore, it must be

                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> opened by asking
                            Director of Central Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard
                                Helms</persName> for a briefing on the Middle East:</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> began by noting that
                            the new Soviet presence required careful evaluation. Israel retained
                            military superiority, but the elements of the Soviet presence are under
                            careful study.</p>
                        <p>“The Soviets have 4–5 regiments of SA–3 missiles in the UAR and 3–5
                            squadrons of Soviet-piloted MIG 21 aircraft.</p>
                        <p>“The President interjected: ‘Are you stating that as a fact? Are we now
                            convinced?’</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied that we feel no
                            doubt that these forces are there. The debate within the intelligence
                            community is over how they have been used. We have intelligence on the
                            forces themselves [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] On the basis of intelligence from all these
                            sources, the presence of the missiles and the pilots is unquestioned.
                            The big issue is how the Soviets intend to use them.</p>
                        <p>“The President asked what the number of Russians in Egypt other than
                            diplomats is. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied
                            that it is in the neighborhood of 10,000. It has doubled in the last six
                            months.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> continued, saying that
                            the Soviet forces are located mainly in the Nile valley. The Israelis
                            have confined their recent attack to the area ajacent to the Suez Canal.
                            The question now is whether the Soviets will refrain from moving their
                            missiles and pilots into that area <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509"
                                facs="0542"/>near the Canal and whether the Israelis will refrain
                            from challenging the Soviet pilots.</p>
                        <p>“Intelligence confirms 13 sites of SA–3 missiles. These are manned by
                            2600–3700 Soviet personnel. There are probably 6–7 other sites under
                            construction. These are located in the Nile Delta north of Cairo, west
                            of Cairo, south of Cairo in connection with a Soviet-manned airfield and
                            at Aswan. The Israelis have unconfirmed reports of SA–3 sites—but not
                            equipment—along the Canal.</p>
                        <p>“This equipment arrived in March and April. Three squadrons of
                            Soviet-piloted aircraft are flying from three bases—15 aircraft in each
                            squadron with about 90 pilots by present count. The pilots arrived in
                            February and March. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        <p>“As a rule, the Soviets stay clear of the Suez Canal. The one major
                            exception [<hi rend="italic">4 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>“Israel has publicly stated that it would avoid the Nile valley but would
                            maintain supremacy over the Canal. Israel has said it would bomb
                            anything along the Canal. They have been bombing heavily bunkers they
                            maintain are being built to house equipment related to the SA–3 missile.
                            U.S. intelligence analysts are inclined to think that these sites are
                            for the SA–2 missile, but they have been so heavily bombed that we may
                            never know what they were intended for.</p>
                        <p>“On the ground, the Israelis only have some 5–700 men along the Bar Lev
                            line on their side of the Canal. There are some 93,000 Egyptians on the
                            other side of the Canal altogether. Dayan says that the main Israeli
                            objective is to keep these Egyptians from massing for a cross-Canal
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>“As far as the Arab-Israeli military balance is concerned, the UAR has
                            some 210–250 aircraft in 20 squadrons. But it does not have enough
                            qualified pilots. Israel has 81 supersonic aircraft and 121 subsonic
                            aircraft and 500 jet pilots. Israel's superiority rests on pilot
                            quality. We assume that Israeli pilots are the equal of ours. Israel
                            keeps 85% of its aircraft flying, while the Egyptians keep only about
                            75% in the air. The Israelis are able to mount 5 sorties per aircraft
                            per day, while the Arabs can only manage 2. Israeli aircraft have
                            superior performance characteristics. The addition of some Soviet pilots
                            will improve the UAR ability to intercept Israeli attackers if the
                            Soviets engage. Soviet pilots are probably more capable than the
                            Egyptian pilots. But they lack combat experience.</p>
                        <p>“The new factor in the situation is the potential for attrition of
                            Israeli aircraft in a prolonged contest with the Soviets. They could
                            exhaust the Israelis in both aircraft and pilots. Israel could at some
                            point come to consider losses intolerable. The present Israeli losses
                            are somewhat less than the annual traffic toll. In terms of economic or
                            demography Israel could stand such levels of losses. But Israel takes
                            losses <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0543"/>hard and any level of
                            losses creates a psychological factor on which the Israeli level of
                            tolerance is relatively low.</p>
                        <p>“This is why Israeli strategy is based on the pre-emptive strike to keep
                            the enemy from bringing its numbers to bear against Israel. This
                            strategy now seems unworkable. It has for some time because of the
                            dispersal of Arab aircraft and the hardening of protective hangars on
                            Arab airfields. Now there is the additional factor that the presence of
                            Soviet pilots could bring on a U.S.-Soviet clash. With the strategy of
                            pre-emption perhaps lost to Israel, the Israelis have more reason than
                            ever to try to control the area along the Suez Canal. The Israelis
                            believe that unless they sustain their present level of attacks or
                            increase it, the Arabs will be so emboldened as to step up the war of
                            attrition.</p>
                        <p>“Israel's ability to maintain air superiority seems to depend on what the
                            Soviets do. The indicators of Soviet intention are the fact that one
                            Soviet pilot on May 14 did pursue an Israeli aircraft and the [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            which indicate the possibility that the Soviets are moving SA–3 missile
                            sites up to the Canal. On the other hand, since May 14, there has been
                            no identified incidents of Soviet pilot pursuit. If the Soviet pilots
                            are ordered to keep their present pattern this situation could go on for
                            some time. If they move up to the Canal, Israel could be quickly worn
                            down. Even at that, the impact of such a Soviet move might be more
                            important psychologically than militarily.</p>
                        <p>“At the least, the Soviet presence has probably already emboldened the
                            Arabs. At most, a situation has been created in which the balance could
                            be altered to Israel's disadvantage. Again, the real effect on the
                            balance will depend on what the Soviets decide to do.</p>
                        <p>“U.S. assistance to date is as follows: 40 Phantoms have been delivered
                            and 3 have been lost; 10 remain to be delivered. Eighty-eight Skyhawks
                            have been delivered with 12 remaining.”</p>

                        <p>“The President said that he wanted to be sure he understood one point: Is
                            it true that, since World War II, the Soviets have not lost any men in

                            significance of this recent Soviet step. It involves Soviet personnel in

                            To them, this poses a very serious problem. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines

                        <p>“The President asked what the Soviets say about the fact that they have
                            generally had a free ride for the last 25 years, using proxies to do
                            their work for them.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said the Soviets
                            do not talk about numbers of combat personnel. They do not deny or admit
                            that they have combat personnel or pilots in the UAR. They say that the
                            reason the Soviets are training Egyptian forces is that the Israeli deep
                            penetration raids in January made this necessary. Whatever the Soviets
                            are doing, the Soviets say has a purely defensive role. They say that
                            they have to back up <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>. The
                            Secretary concluded that, as long as the deep penetration raids do not

                            never really negotiated with each other. This is a good time. Israel is

                        <p>“The Secretary proposed that the U.S. use the next three months to try to
                            get negotiations started. He felt that we should continue to sell planes
                            to Israel at about the same rate as in the recent past. At the same time
                            we should make a major effort in New York under Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> to get negotiations started.
                            ‘We think there is a good chance Israel will go along now.’ The
                            Secretary said his plan is to have a low-key announcement in about a
                            week. He thought there was a possibility to get negotiations started.
                            Until we do, there is no possibility of a settlement. He repeated that
                            he felt the Israelis and the Soviets are interested.</p>
                        <p>“The President turned to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to brief on the issues involved.</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said he had
                            intended to draw together some of the issues which had been raised in
                            the Special Review Group meetings on this subject, but he would like to
                            go back a half a step to start with.</p>
                        <p>“The immediate issue is aircraft for Israel. The State Department view
                            has been as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>
                            outlined it—that we should continue some shipments of aircraft to Israel
                            while we launch a diplomatic initiative. The Defense Department view has
                            been that we should provide no planes now because deliveries would
                            inflame the Arab world.</p>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> continued that
                            discussion of some of the issues underlies any decision we may make on
                            aircraft. For instance, although the facts of Soviet intervention in the
                            UAR are pretty agreed, there are <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0545"
                            />different views of Soviet purpose and of the significance of the
                            Soviet move: <list>
                                <item>“—One view is that the Soviet move is entirely defensive, that
                                    the Soviets had no choice but to make this move in response to
                                    Israel's deep penetration raids and that the significance of the
                                    move is therefore limited.</item>
                                <item>“—Another view is that, whatever Soviet intentions are, we are
                                    confronted with certain results. The Soviet move does free the
                                    UAR to be more belligerent. Even if there is an Arab-Israeli
                                    settlement, if the Soviet forces remain in Egypt, the UAR will
                                    feel stronger in whatever adventures it decides to pursue.
                                    Britain did not want an empire; it simply acquired one in the
                                    course of seeking coaling stations on the commercial route to
                                    the Far East. The practical consequence of a Soviet presence in
                                    the UAR is that it is a major geopolitical fact with which we
                                    have to deal. The consequences cannot be judged by Soviet
                                    intent.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> asked what
                            difference it makes which view one takes. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> replied that the view one
                            takes makes some difference on whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is confronted now or not. The President said there was
                            a question of whether the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should
                            be confronted on a broader front. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> pointed out that even if the Arab-Israeli
                            dispute is settled, that still leaves a problem for the U.S. in that the
                            Soviet Union can work behind the radical Arabs in further eroding U.S.
                            influence in the area.</p>
                        <p>“The President asked whether it is in the Soviet interest to see an
                            Arab-Israeli settlement. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> may
                            not want to see Israel ‘go down the tube.’ It may well be that the
                            Soviets have an interest in having Israel there as a ‘burr under the
                            U.S. saddle.’ The President said he questioned whether the Soviets have
                            an interest in a real settlement; he could understand their interest in
                            a truce or a cooling of the situation but had more question about a full
                            settlement. He felt that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>'s point is relevant and that it is not right
                            for the US to look at what the Soviets are doing in the UAR as an
                            isolated problem.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said he thought
                            everyone could agree to that.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> noted one Soviet
                            interest that had not been mentioned: The Soviets want the Suez Canal
                            open.”</p>
                        <p>After discussion of other Middle East issues, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> raised additional points about the Soviet
                            Union. According to minutes of the meeting: “</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> returned to the
                            thread of his briefing, noting that the third element that must be dealt
                            with in any strategy is the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The
                            normal pattern of Soviet activity is to begin with a relatively modest
                            step and then to inch forward testing the ground as they go.</p>
                        <p>“The President interjected by asking how the Soviets proceeded in Cuba.
                            The replies were vague, and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> continued briefing.</p>
                        <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0546"/>
                        <p>“Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            problem with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is to convince
                            them that their present course has incalculable risks. But at the same
                            time we do not want to engage Soviet prestige and leave the Soviets no
                            escape. The choice for the U.S. is not whether to try for a settlement
                            or to confront the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The choice is
                            how to do both in order to achieve a settlement.”</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion of other factors affecting a Middle Eastern
                            peace settlement, discussion returned to the Soviet position:</p>
                        <p>“The President said he still came back to a basic point that militates
                            against a settlement: What is in it for the Soviets? The present
                            situation is costing them some money. They may be concerned about a
                            possible confrontation with the U.S. But if they look at that
                            proposition coldly, they know as well as we know around the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> table that the likelihood of U.S.
                            action directly against them is ‘in doubt.’ It did not use to be in
                            doubt. That was what the Lebanon invasion of 1958 was about.</p>
                        <p>“Again looking at the Soviets: they have made noises that they would like
                            to see a settlement. They have a muscle-bound bureaucracy and have
                            trouble seeing things in gradations. It may be that as far as the
                            Soviets are concerned our job is to get them to play a role in imposing
                            a settlement. The ingredient that is missing and has to be supplied in
                            some way is the incentive to them to play that role.</p>
                        <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> noted that the
                            Soviets are concerned about the Chinese and about the Fedayeen. Soviet
                            officials often allude to those problems. <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> is concerned about what has happened in Jordan
                            and that he may be in some danger.</p>
                        <p>“Ambassador Yost said that the Soviets do not call the tune in Cairo. If
                            a settlement in Arab interests emerges, he did not believe that the
                            Soviets could prevent it.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said that, while he
                            agreed about the Fedayeen and the Chinese, he put greater weight on what
                            the Soviets think of American will. The real leverage on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is fear of a confrontation with the
                            U.S. We ought to be looking at the 6th Fleet to see whether it is
                            projecting American power to the maximum extent. His conclusion, he
                            said, is that the Soviets feel now that they can broaden the conflict.
                            We are essentially up against a Soviet political strategy, but at the
                            end of the line they must feel that they could run into a confrontation
                            with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> indicated his
                            agreement. He felt that we need to find a way to use the only lever that
                            we really have—the Soviet fear of confrontation.</p>
                        <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> said that this is a
                            matter of timing. He said we have to move ahead soon. We should avoid
                            moving planes. He liked the idea of having a pool of aircraft perhaps in
                            Texas as a reserve for Israel which would not be moved to Israel unless
                            the situation required.</p>

                            this was the channel in which he wished things to be settled. He also
                            stressed to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that things
                            that were in the public arena might be put in other channels but, if
                            serious business was to be done, it was to be done in our channel.</p>
                        <p>He reminded <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that at their
                            last meeting, he had told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that he had been in office nine months and it
                            was about time that the baby was born; therefore, there was a certain
                            disappointment that there had been no progress. He wanted him to know
                            that he was prepared to let bygones be bygones and start afresh if the
                            Soviet Union was prepared to take a similar approach. He wanted it
                            clearly understood that the course on Vietnam was set and there was no
                            sense in trying to press us to change our policies. Similarly, he
                            understood certain Soviet security requirements that we were not
                            disposed to challenge. He wanted <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> and me to speak in this spirit.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether he could
                            make a few comments. He said that he appreciated that spirit and he felt
                            the same way. It was time to let bygones be bygones and concentrate on
                            the future. There was no sense in arguing about how we got into Cambodia
                            and other areas of the world. The future would determine how able we
                            were to solve the problems of peace. He did want to say, however, that
                            the Soviet Union was very eager to come to an agreement on the Middle
                            East, but was being constantly thwarted by the petty legalism of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s approach. He would
                            like to urge the President to take a personal interest in the
                            negotiations, because only a willingness to deal with the problems at
                            the highest levels would make it possible to come to a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized that we had an <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting on the Middle East<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d166">Document 166</ref>.</note> and that this
                            was one area in which matters could get out of control because of the
                            pressures of public opinion. He said, “The Fedayeen are not in your
                            control, and our public opinion is not in our control.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said, “The Fedayeen are not in
                            our control but we don't let them control our actions, and we make very
                            sure that we keep tight control of our military forces.” The President
                            said that he just wanted <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            to understand that we were serious in our efforts, but that we were
                            pragmatic and precise. He hoped that he and I would speak in that
                            spirit.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> began the conversation
                            by saying that he hoped for very complete results and complete
                            discussions. The difficulty with some of our present negotiators was
                            that they didn't seem to be well briefed, like the Secretary of State;
                            or if they were well briefed, like <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName>, they were too petty and never saw the wood for
                            the trees.</p>
                        <p>He said that Cambodia had had at first a very severe impact on the Soviet
                            leadership. When he had come to Moscow with my suggestion for a summit
                                meeting,<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s talking point on
                                a summit reads: “At our last meeting I had indicated the possibility
                                of you and Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                                breaking a Vienna <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> deadlock and
                                ratifying the agreement at a summit meeting. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would explore this
                                in Moscow and have an answer upon his return. I plan to let him take
                                any initiative on the question of a summit meeting. I would say that
                                I will take this up with you, while repeating that we would be
                                interested in a summit that was assured of a significant agreement
                                on at least one issue.” (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, and <persName

                            However, as time went on after the Cambodian events, opinion shifted and
                            they believed I had mentioned a summit meeting merely to hold them quiet
                            while we were preparing the Cambodian invasion. I said it was probably
                            futile to argue this point but I could assure him that the Cambodian
                            invasion was not planned before April 20, and as he remembered, I warned
                            Vorontsov immediately that if North Vietnamese attacks on Cambodia did
                            not stop we might have to take drastic measures.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what North
                            Vietnamese operations we objected to. I said that as long as they stayed
                            in the base areas we could live with the situation, though we didn't
                            like it. Once they left the sanctuaries, however, they represented an
                            intolerable threat to the security of our forces by turning the whole
                            country into one base area. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he was prepared to speak about
                            Cambodia a little later, but he first wanted to pick up the President's
                            points which were that we should forget about the past and concentrate
                            on the future, and in the future it was necessary to come to some very
                            concrete understandings between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                            He suggested that we take up the subjects in the order mentioned by the
                            President: <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, first; the Middle
                            East, second; Europe, third; and, Vietnam last. I said I could agree
                            except that I wanted to put Europe in the last spot and put Vietnam and
                            Southeast Asia before it.</p>

                                Vienna, Austria, on April 16, 1970.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he wanted to
                            find out whether our understanding of April was still adequate, i.e.,
                            whether we were still prepared to have a limited agreement, and if so,
                            how we should handle business in Vienna. Should we tell our negotiators
                            in Vienna that they had gone far enough or that we wanted them to
                            explore a little further; or did we want to charge them with making
                            specific agreements?</p>
                        <p>I told him that it seemed to me that the negotiators in Vienna could go
                            on for another three weeks, during which time he and I might discuss the
                            specific principles of a settlement and agree on a general outline. We
                            could then decide whether to have that taken up at Vienna or whether we
                            should have it discussed in some other forum. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said this was agreeable to him
                            and that their delegation would be instructed accordingly.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me what I understood by a limited agreement. I said that to
                            us a limited agreement meant a ceiling on offensive weapons and a
                            limitation on defensive weapons to what we call national command
                            authority levels. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            this was not a very limited agreement because it encompassed the whole
                            range of strategic forces.</p>
                        <p>I asked him whether the Soviets had another definition. He said that to
                            the Soviets limited agreement meant that the Soviets probably would
                            prefer a limitation on <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> deployment
                            with some general agreement about protection against provocative
                            attacks, which he explained meant third country attacks. I told him that
                            this was almost certainly unacceptable to us. It would be more useful to
                            explore some package that involved ceilings on all strategic forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that this
                            raised a number of issues. Our package had been weighted against the
                            Soviet Union. For example, we had established a ceiling of 1,710
                            missiles and a separate ceiling of the existing forces of bombers,
                            giving us 500 and giving them 250. This established an inequality which
                            was unfortunate, of course. There were some Soviet scientists who said
                            both sides already possessed overkill and therefore it didn't make any
                            difference. He did not want to argue that point, but he did wish to
                            point out that the symbolic effect of the Soviet Union accepting
                            inferiority in any category would be very bad and very hard to sell.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of the bomber package was that the Soviet Union had no
                            equivalent for our aircraft carriers and, therefore, there should be <pb
                                n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0551"/>some limitation on their
                            deployment. I pointed out that aircraft carriers did not play a
                            significant role in our strategy against the Soviet Union, but that any
                            limitation on their deployment would affect their utility against other
                            countries. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that if
                            we were concerned about aircraft carriers we had to agree to the
                            principle of some form of compensation for the Soviets, either in the
                            form of giving them additional units of missiles or in some other way.
                            He also pointed out that we were counting their tanker planes as bombers
                            while we did not count ours.</p>
                        <p>I told him that the way to advance this problem would be for him to give
                            me some idea of what they meant by compensation. If it was a symbolic
                            compensation, we might consider it. If it was a major one, it would be
                            difficult. I also pointed out to him that NCA levels involved
                            limitations on radars and not just on missiles. He asked me to explain
                            this, and I gave him a brief explanation of the differential lead time
                            between missiles and radars. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> replied that radars useful for missile tracking
                            were clearly distinguishable from others. He thought this was a
                            proposition that could be entertained as long as it did not involve the
                            destruction of existing radars and only limitations on building new
                            ones. We summed up the results of this part of the discussion as
                            follows: <list>

                                <item>He would give me some idea of what the Soviet Union understood

                                <item>I would explore whether there were other limitations available
                                    on the bombers. (I was thinking of the fact that budgetary
                                    reasons might force us to reduce our bomber force and that we
                                    might throw that into the equation.)</item>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then launched into an
                            impassioned discussion on the Middle East. He said that we completely
                            misunderstood Soviet motivations and intentions, and that we had to look
                            at the problem from the Soviet point of view. We might not believe it,
                            but the Soviets had not taken advantage of a tenth of the opportunities
                            they had had to place military forces into several of the Arab
                            countries. In 1967 the Egyptians had offered them naval bases and free
                            use of all of the air bases if they only came in. Since then they've had
                            repeated offers from Egypt and from Syria to put military forces into
                            their countries, but they had always refused.</p>
                        <p>However, the deep penetration raids of the Israelis had left them no
                            choice. They could not permit one of their friends in the Middle East to
                            be totally humiliated and destroyed and there were no other <pb n="519"
                                xml:id="pg_519" facs="0552"/>means available to protect them. The
                            Soviet Union desired no military presence in Egypt and it thought that
                            the time was ripe to make a comprehensive settlement.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East was out
                            of the question along the lines of the <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            conversations. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> constantly
                            was raising pettifogging objections and was trying to draw him into
                            drafting specific clauses of an agreement. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said, for example, that the two offers he had
                            brought back with him from Moscow matched almost verbatim the
                            formulations that <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> had
                            demanded of him. Nevertheless, it was treated as only a minor concession
                            because he had referred him to the Soviet June 9 document rather than to
                            our October 28 document. He said we had to understand the fact that the
                            Soviet Union could not accept the United States document as a basis for
                            a settlement. On the other hand, it would not insist on its own and in
                            its final formulation would come up with something that would not be
                            ascribable to either side.</p>
                        <p>The major decision that had to be made was whether both sides were
                            willing to make significant progress now. This required filling in the
                            gaps of the agreement: specifically, on withdrawals, on Sharm-el-Sheik,
                            on demilitarized zones and similar matters. This would then be put as a
                            recommendation to <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> who
                            would take it up with the parties.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether he was talking of an imposed settlement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said, “No, not imposed. But of
                            course our recommendations would carry a great deal of weight.” And he
                            added, “Believe me, that if we make a proposition to the Arabs, we will
                            also see to it that it is accepted.” However, he said it was essential
                            that we make a prior decision that there would be a concrete agreement.
                            He said that the time was short and that there were only a few months
                            left before events could take an unpredictable turn.</p>
                        <p>I told him that for us the presence of Soviet combat personnel in Egypt
                            was a matter of the very gravest consequence which sooner or later would
                            produce a major difficulty with the United States and could perhaps even
                            lead to a confrontation. We have no incentive at all in a settlement
                            which would leave combat personnel in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>I, therefore, wanted to know whether, assuming that there were a peace
                            settlement, the Soviet Union would be prepared to withdraw its combat
                            personnel. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what
                            would happen if the Israelis started deep penetration raids in this
                            period. I said I was talking about what would happen after, not before,
                            there was an agreement between the Israelis and the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that under those
                            conditions it was conceivable to him that the Soviet Union might agree
                            to withdraw its personnel. He said he would query Moscow and get me an
                            answer at our next meeting <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0553"/>on
                            whether the Soviet Union would withdraw its combat personnel as part of
                            a general Middle East settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked me if I had
                            anything specific to propose on the Middle East. I said that under the
                            right circumstances it was not inconceivable to me that we would be
                            prepared to discuss a general settlement of the Middle East issues with
                            the Soviet Union as long as it was understood that the Soviet Union
                            would ask for some sacrifices from the Arabs commensurate to the
                            sacrifices we would have to ask from the Israelis.</p>
                        <p>This led <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> into a long
                            exposition of the Soviet position and an explanation of the many
                            sacrifices they had already made, specifically with respect to
                            Sharm-el-Sheik, demilitarized zones, conditions of peace, and control of
                            the Fedayeen. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked
                            me what was new in my proposal. I said the newness in our proposal was
                            the willingness to discuss the specific terms of the settlement and not
                            just the general outline. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said frankly there was nothing new in that
                            because <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had already made
                            that proposition to him when they were having drinks on Monday, but he
                            was happy to see that it was backed by the President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then read to me a long
                            statement which he allegedly got from the newspaper and which paralleled
                            the State Department recommendation to the President. He asked me what I
                            thought of it. (I later learned from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> that the Secretary gave most of this to <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> at their meeting on June
                                8.)<note n="6" xml:id="d168fn6">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is in error; the
                                meeting was on June 2. However, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                    >Kissinger</persName> received a memorandum from <persName

                            told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that this was one
                            of the proposals that was before the President. Many elements of it
                            might have interesting aspects, but I did not want to comment prior to a
                            Presidential decision.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again made an
                            impassioned plea for a settlement of the Mid-Eastern issue which could
                            only drag us all into incalculable results. He said that the Soviet
                            Union was willing to guarantee access through the Straits of Tiran and
                            the Suez Canal. When I raised the objection that the Soviet Union had
                            gone no further than to guarantee the 1888 Convention, he said this was
                            only because it represented the only usable legal document to guarantee
                            free access. They were prepared to define access in any way that would
                            meet Israeli objections.</p>
                        <p>We left it that I would talk to the President and inform him before we
                            made a major move and that he would find out from Moscow whether the
                            Soviet Union would be prepared to withdraw combat personnel as part of a
                            general settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0554"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to Southeast Asia. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he found it very
                            difficult to understand how we thought a peaceful settlement was now
                            possible. He did not doubt the military gains that we had made in
                            Cambodia, but on the other hand, we had given the Chinese a tremendous
                            shot in the arm. The Chinese were now using Cambodia as a campaign
                            against the Soviet Union, and had tried to induce the Soviet Union to
                            cancel all meetings with the United States. Also, China was clearly in
                            the ascendance in Hanoi. The result would be that it would be very
                            difficult to make a settlement. The Chinese would never accept a
                            pro-American government in Cambodia and neither would Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>I said that we did not expect them to accept a pro-American government in
                            Cambodia. We were perfectly willing to live with a Sihanouk-type
                            government provided it did not give Communist supplies access into the
                            sanctuaries. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> wanted to
                            know whether we had been prepared to accept the sanctuaries if the North
                            Vietnamese had not moved out of them. I told him that, of course, we had
                            accepted them for many years and that we had never made any plans for
                            attacking them until after their threat to Cambodia had become
                            evident.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that I might not
                            believe it, but they had no particular interest in a Communist
                            government in Cambodia because such a government was certain to be
                            dominated from Peking. He hoped that we had noticed that they had
                            maintained a Chargé in Phnom Penh and had not recognized Sihanouk, even
                            though <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> had written him
                            some letters. He also called my attention to the article in the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi>. He added, “Well, whatever has
                            happened in Cambodia has happened, and there's no sense in talking about
                            past history.” He wanted to know what sort of political settlement for
                            Cambodia we had in mind. I replied that we would certainly be willing to
                            accept a government that had the general composition of the Sihanouk
                            government. In fact, the government in Phnom Penh was the Sihanouk
                            government minus Sihanouk.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then wanted to know
                            whether we were prepared to partition Laos. He said he had heard this as
                            a suggestion from the State Department. I said that there were many
                            ideas floating around but we were certainly prepared to discuss any
                            reasonable plan that would assure the neutrality and security of
                            Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>With respect to South Vietnam, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that for the North Vietnamese, the only
                            interesting point was the political settlement. They did not much care
                            about the rate of American troop withdrawals. They did not believe in a
                            process of free elections, and as long as we insisted on them, there was
                            no hope of a political solution. I pointed <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522"
                                facs="0555"/>out to him the passage in the President's April 20th
                                speech<note n="7" xml:id="d168fn7">The relevant passage reads: “A

                                political forces within South Vietnam. We recognize the complexity
                                of shaping machinery that would fairly apportion political power in
                                South Vietnam. We are flexible; we have offered nothing on a

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me about my
                            assessment of my talks with the North Vietnamese. I said that the North
                            Vietnamese had missed a great opportunity, and that if they had told
                            Moscow that we had been rigid, they were severely mistaken. After all,
                            the President need not send his personal advisor to negotiate if he
                            wanted merely to have the stalemate that already existed in Paris. There
                            was no sense in repeating standard positions. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> obviously had not read a very
                            full account of the meetings because he kept saying that the impression
                            that Hanoi had left with them was that we had been very rigid. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he didn't see any
                            possibilities for great movement at this moment, but that the situation
                            might change after the end of our Cambodian operation.</p>

                        <p>We then turned to Europe. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            said that we were the chief obstacle to the European Security Conference
                            idea that they had put forward. I said that they had never explained
                            satisfactorily why it was necessary to have a big conference simply to
                            settle cultural and trade matters. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that it was impossible to please the
                            United States. When they had proposed to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> to have a European Security Conference, they had
                            been accused of wanting to settle too much. In this Administration, they
                            were accused of trying to settle too little. He said we were oscillating
                            between being too specific and being too vague.</p>
                        <p>For example, he simply did not know what we meant by mutual balanced
                            force reductions and, frankly, he had the impression that we didn't know
                            ourselves what we meant by the term. As an example of how impossible it
                            was to deal with us, he mentioned the luncheon conversation he had had
                            with <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Elliot Richardson</persName>.<note

                            it was very unusual for a foreign diplomat to comment on a working paper
                            of another foreign office. When he had called this to the attention of
                                <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName>, the latter
                            replied that he needed <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            comments in order to bring the military around in our country. I told
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I would be
                            ready to talk in concrete details about mutual balanced force reductions
                            later this summer, after we had worked out our own thinking a little
                            more fully.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We then turned to the general subject of Soviet-American relations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that when the
                            Administration had come into office, the leadership in Moscow was very
                            concerned, given the past reputation of the President. Then, there was a
                            period of relative hopefulness. This was dashed by the visit to Romania
                            and there was a period of stagnation. Then, just when things began to
                            pick up again, we had invaded Cambodia. Nevertheless, the Soviet
                            leadership was willing to let bygones be bygones, as long as we
                            understood that their desire for an agreement did not reflect weakness
                            and that their domestic difficulties were figments of the American
                            press.</p>
                        <p>I told him that we recognized the Soviet Union as a major country. We, of
                            course, assumed that any agreement they made would reflect mutual
                            interests and could not be imposed by either side. Our view was that
                            either we could proceed along tactical lines as we had for most of our
                            relationship in the post-war period, or we could make an effort at a
                            fundamental improvement in relations. If we did the latter, the United
                            States would be prepared to make a serious effort in the channels that
                            the President had indicated, with the purpose of marking this
                            Administration as the one in which the basic turning point towards peace
                            had been made. Such an agreement would, of course, have to include that
                            neither side would take advantage of any difficulties that the other
                            might face in other parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>This led <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to ask me how we
                            were getting on in our relationship with China. I said that it was very
                            interesting that China was vitriolic in its public attacks but very
                            polite in its private conversations. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he suspected as much. He said, “Are
                            you going to try to get on better terms with Communist China?” I
                            responded that we would continue talking but their own experience must
                            teach them that progress would not be very rapid. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> believed China would try to
                            lead a crusade against us. I said that we were relaxed about this and
                            would probably try to stay in contact with them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We then summed up the conversation by listing the things that were going
                            to be done. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would try to

                            case of a settlement. I would give him some idea of the range of limited
                            agreements that we could discuss and some procedure for approaching the
                            Middle East problem.</p>
                        <p>There was some extended conversation about the various personalities with
                            whom <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> had worked here,
                            and his own estimate of them which was extraordinarily shrewd. For
                            example, he said that he had never been much for Robert Kennedy because
                            he thought that underneath his liberal facade, he was an extremely tough
                            man. After about a year, he would have been the most intransigent cold
                            warrior that had ever been in the Presidency. Of the Secretaries of
                            State that he had met he thought Dulles was the most impressive and Rusk
                            was the most reliable. I did not ask him to speak about any members of
                            the present Administration.<note n="10" xml:id="d168fn10">On June 15,

                        <p>The President gave me his views as follows on a number of basic issues
                            between the US and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. He
                            strongly favored an increase in American commercial sales to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (including Gleason gear) under
                            conditions of a hoped-for and an anticipated improvement in the
                            atmosphere later this summer. He did not want to attach explicit
                            conditions since this would provoke a bad reaction, but economic moves
                            could “kick along” the process of working out a live-and-let-live
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Within this context the President wished me to get the idea across that
                            he was resolved to lay the basis for realistic negotiations with the
                            Soviet Union. We had a policy and plan for Vietnam, which would take on
                            further substance at the end of our Cambodian operation and he was
                            determined to stop the war.</p>
                        <p>As regards the Middle East, we envisaged initiatives which would open up
                            possibilities for negotiations in this area as well. The Soviets should,
                            of course, display restraint.</p>
                        <p>The President said we were also intensely serious about <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> and it was clear both sides would
                            profit from an understanding which would lighten the financial burden
                            for us and would spare the Soviet Union a costly competition in keeping
                            up with our technology and military production.</p>
                        <p>The President hoped that the range of subjects he was offering as
                            suitable for negotiation would prove attractive to the Soviets. Although
                            the establishment of true friendship between the two countries was
                            probably illusory because of Soviet attitudes, the basis could be laid
                            by which the two competing great powers could order their affairs for
                            the furtherance of world stability. The President wished it to be made
                            clear that our intentions and plans were to move forward. He thought
                            there were signs recently of Soviet movement, too.</p>
                        <p>The President mentioned some personal ideas about pursuing the
                            relationship further.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me for my views on the Middle East and Indochina. I
                            gave reasons why I thought the Soviets neither wanted the total
                            elimination of Israel nor chaos in the Middle East, especially because
                            of their involvement with Communist China. As regards Indochina, I felt
                            North Vietnam was the apple of their eye in Asia and in fact the main
                            base for Soviet influence, present and future, in Asia. As a result of
                            Sihanouk's defection in the direction of Communist China, the Soviets
                            were extremely concerned about losing the North Vietnamese to Chinese
                            domination. The Soviets were waiting to see how they could best protect
                            their interests in a sorting out of developments in Indochina. Possibly
                            they had considered multilateral discussions, as indicated by Jacob
                                <persName corresp="#p_MYA1">Malik</persName>'s suggestion in New
                            York, but they had apparently been unable to obtain Hanoi's consent.</p>
                        <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0559"/>
                        <p>The President asked me about leadership problems in the Soviet Union. I
                            referred to changes which might take place either in the wake of the
                            Supreme Soviet elections which have just been held, or in connection
                            with the Party Congress mooted for late October or early November. The
                            President thought the regime might well wish to have some kind of an
                            agreement in <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> before or at about
                            the time of the Party Congress.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President's question, I expressed the view that chances
                            of change in the Politburo could be about 50–50 during the course of the
                            current year, resulting from the aftermath of the Supreme Soviet
                            elections and the Party Congress. I felt <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> would probably profit and stressed the point
                            that he was a man not to be underestimated. Although he was held to be
                            unimaginative, he is forceful, a good administrator and a formidable
                            personality in debate. (I had in mind information from Czech sources
                            about his handling of Dubcek at the critical meetings before the Soviet
                            invasion in August 1968.)</p>
                        <p>The President said he was considering sending out Secretaries Hardin and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SMH3">Stans</persName> to Moscow, perhaps in
                            August. The President will make his decision in July. He said he would
                            like to receive some Soviet political personalities in return, but I
                            pointed out this might be difficult before the end of the year because
                            of a possible Soviet Party Congress session in the fall.</p>

                            parties together overcome the traditional practice of one side insisting
                            on direct negotiations while the other side insisted on indirect
                            discussions? Second, was the United States not, in effect, “throwing
                            away” the results of the Two-Power and Four-Power negotiations? To the
                            first concern, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> replied
                            that the “wording of formula in effect gave <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> discretionary power with respect to procedural
                            arrangements.” <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> added that
                            “each side would have to justify entering negotiations with other side
                            within framework of its own policy and its preferred procedure of
                            negotiations.” On <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            second concern, <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> “took
                            considerable pains to assure <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that Two-Power and Four-Power negotiations
                            would continue in parallel with negotiations between parties directly
                            concerned and that once latter under way the Four Powers would be in a
                            position to influence their course and make a real contribution to a
                            settlement.” (Telegram 97773 to Moscow, June 20; National Archives,

                        <p>The conversation came about in the following way. First, there were
                            indications that the Soviet delegation wanted to wind up the <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks in Vienna. Secondly, Gerry
                            Smith was pressing for new instructions authorizing him to offer a more
                            limited option. Third, the President did not want the settlement to be
                            arrived at in Vienna but, if possible, at a summit meeting. He asked me
                            to find out from <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> what
                            the Soviet real intentions were, especially with respect to the
                            conversations we had had in April<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d150">Documents 150</ref> and <ref target="#d152"
                                    >152</ref>.</note> prior to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>'s departure for Moscow where it was agreed
                            that, if possible, if there should be a deadlock in Vienna, we would
                            break it at a summit.</p>
                        <p>I saw <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in the Map Room of
                            the White House and said to him that we were at a point where some
                            decisions had to be made with respect to instructions for the Vienna
                            delegation and that it would help us to understand Soviet intentions
                            properly. I said Semyonov's suggestion of an early end of the Vienna
                            phase could lead to three interpretations: (1) the Soviet Union did not
                            want an agreement on <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> this year at
                            all; (2) the Soviet Union wanted an agreement at Vienna and was using
                            this device in order to elicit a different American proposal; and (3)
                            the Soviet Union wanted an agreement but not at Vienna <pb n="529"
                                xml:id="pg_529" facs="0562"/>and was stalemating the talks there in
                            order to permit the other leaders to settle the issue. I would
                            appreciate <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            guidance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, who was noticeably more
                            businesslike and less cordial than at previous meetings, said the first
                            interpretation was clearly out of the question. The Soviet Union did
                            want an agreement on <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> even though
                            our two positions were not yet close enough to set a definite date. As
                            for Vienna, it was the Soviet Union's judgment that an agreement,
                            including offensive and defensive weapons, could not be negotiated in
                            the time available at Vienna. As for the third interpretation, he was
                            without instructions and he would have to inquire in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what I thought of
                            an agreement confined to <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>. I said I
                            saw no reason to change our position since the last time we met. I also
                            mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I had
                            been waiting for him to give me some answers to questions I had put to
                            him on the <hi rend="italic">Sequoia</hi>.<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3"
                                >See <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that I have so many
                            questions that it was hard for him to know to which I was referring. I
                            said that this was the first time that I had seen <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> miss a point, and I was
                            particularly concerned about the Middle East. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not take the bait about
                            the suggestion of Soviet troop withdrawal in case of a settlement.
                            Instead, he said, “We offered you bilateral talks. We made a major
                            proposal. We considered it a significant concession. In return, we have
                            had no reply for three weeks, and then you make a unilateral overture.
                            It is your problem now, and we are out of it. We suspect that you may
                            have to come back to us later, but whether our concessions will still be
                            open then remains to be seen.”</p>
                        <p>I said that the American initiatives should be seen as a corollary to the
                            two-power discussions, not as a substitute for them. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that I well knew his
                            attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>'s conduct
                            of the negotiations and until we started getting serious, there wasn't
                            really too much hope for progress. At any rate, it was no longer the
                            Soviet Union's problem and was ours. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> promised me an answer by the time we returned

                        </list>
                        <p>Last week the three top Soviet leaders—<persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PNV1"
                                >Podgorny</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName>—all gave their “election” speeches. Taken
                            together they represent a rather comprehensive report on current Soviet
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>No major shift is foreshadowed in the three speeches on foreign policy.
                            All of the leaders seemed to take a somewhat softer line than might have
                            been anticipated in light of tensions in the Middle East and Asia. We
                            came in for what appears to be a standard share of criticism, some of it
                            sharp and pointed, especially for our policies in Southeast Asia. Yet
                            there seemed to be an effort to insulate Soviet-American relations in
                            general, from specific crisis areas.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was the most forthright
                            in calling for establishment of good relations; <persName
                                corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> was the more pessimistic in
                            describing our relations as “frozen.” <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, who was in the middle, rhetorically asked if
                            good relations were possible, and answered positively. In particular, he
                            took pains to stress that it would be possible to solve major
                            international problems with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>There was no mention whatsoever of <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>,
                            in marked contrast to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s

                                    >Document 157</ref>.</note> of May 4 in which he warned that our
                            Cambodian operations generated distrust that could affect <gloss

                        <p>The Soviet position on Vietnam and Cambodia, stripped of some of the
                            propaganda hyperbole, was rather guarded. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> spoke of Soviet support for the “just
                            principles and demands of the patriotic forces of the peoples of
                            Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos as the basis for a political
                            settlement,”—thus slighting the military aspects.</p>
                        <p>On the Middle East, however, the Soviet position remained tough.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> boasted that the
                            “defense capacity” of the Arab states had been “restored,” and that the
                            “liberation” of the captured Arab territories was the “key prerequisite”
                            for a settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0564"/>
                        <p>The most optimistic note in all three reports concerned European affairs.
                            Relations with Germany was singled out for a positive evaluation, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> generally
                            anticipated a favorable conclusion to the current negotiations with Bonn
                            on a renunciation of force treaty. (He spoke before the recent German
                            elections which may have the effect of inhibiting Brandt's policy.)</p>
                        <p>In contrast to the favorable impression of their Western prospects, all
                            of the Soviet leaders were critical of Peking and pessimistic over their
                            border talks. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was more
                            restrained, <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> the
                            sharpest, and <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, again, in
                            the middle.</p>
                        <p>Most of the speeches of the leaders were taken up with internal matters,
                            with all making the usual pledge of a better lot for the Soviet people.
                            Sharp differences were apparent, however, over the question of
                            continuing the economic reform. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> mentioned it only in passing, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName> added a critical note, and
                            only <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> made a spirited
                            defense of the reform. All this suggests that drafting of the next five
                            year plan, which is now underway, may be causing divisions within the
                            leadership. This may be part of the growing speculation, confirmed by
                            several sources, that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            will go into voluntary retirement this year, which probably would
                            strengthen <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s
                            predominance.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> emphasizes that your
                            appeal “sounds unconvincing” because of our “armed intervention” in
                            Laos, and our failure to make a similar appeal at the time when
                            operations intensified last autumn and led to the capture of a series of
                            areas long under the control of the “patriotic forces.”</p>
                        <p>As for convening the Geneva conference (1962) in “one form or another”,
                            this is rejected by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> as
                            “unreal in present conditions …<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">Ellipsis in
                                the source text.</note> when there is going on a war unleashed by
                            the USA against the Vietnamese people as well as armed intervention in
                            the affairs of Laos and now also Cambodia.”</p>
                        <p>He adopts a much tougher position than heretofore on the Souvanna Phouma
                            Government, claiming that there is “no such government (of national
                            union)” as created by the Geneva accords. It must be created by the
                            “political forces” of Laos, he asserts. And he cites as the basis for
                            internal consultations among the Laotians, the proposals of the Pathet
                            Lao. He adds, however, that even these consultations cannot lead to the
                            restoration of peace: “the war cannot be brought to a close” or
                            consultations “moved off dead center” as long as the U.S. continues
                            bombing and “generally interferes in Laotian internal affairs.”</p>
                        <p>Substantively, this reply represents some hardening of the Soviet
                            position, which is consistent with the tougher line reflected in the
                            recent letter from Souphanavoung to Souvanna Phouma and the increased
                            military action of the Communist side. It comes close to saying the
                            Geneva agreements are a dead letter, and that even those parts
                            pertaining to the coalition government are no longer valid. This is
                            probably intended to increase the pressures on Souvanna, who is always
                            concerned with signs that the Soviet might formally withdraw recognition
                            of his government. The letter stops short of this, however. One possible
                            sign of flexibility is the failure to make cessation of the bombing a
                            precondition to talks among the Laotians.</p>
                        <p>The hard line taken by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in
                            his reply can be considered pro forma, in that the Soviet position on
                            Laos has consistently been to support Hanoi and the Pathet Lao, and to
                            blame the U.S. for all the problems of Vietnam, Laos, and now Cambodia.
                            The tone of the reply may also reflect Soviet frustrations over the way
                            that Soviet influence in Hanoi has declined recently as Chinese
                            influence has grown. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Koysgin</persName>
                            <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0566"/>may in effect be saying that
                            the Soviets simply do not want to be involved in Indo-Chinese affairs
                            under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that the reply merits any further action on your part.
                            We do not wish to become engaged in an unproductive exchange with the
                            Soviets. However, for the purpose of setting the record straight on the
                            causes of the tensions in Indo-China and denying the Soviets the last
                            word on this, I believe it would be useful for me to set the record
                            straight with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> when I
                            next see him and lay it on the line as to the presence of North
                            Vietnamese troops in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as the source of all
                            the trouble.</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">Dear Mr. President:</p>
                            <p>We would like to make several observations concerning your letter
                                regarding Laos.</p>
                            <p>It was pointed out in your letter that the Government of the United
                                States does not spare any efforts to secure peace in Laos by means
                                of the full implementation of the 1962 Geneva agreements. One could
                                only welcome such a statement, if it indicated the intention to end
                                the American intervention in Laos, which would conform to the
                                obligation of the USA under these agreements. Unfortunately, the
                                situation has been and is entirely otherwise; the American Air Force
                                continues the bombardment of the territory of Laos; American
                                “Advisers” are in the ranks of the armed forces of one of the
                                Laotian sides and frequently participate directly in military
                                operations.</p>
                            <p>In these conditions the appeal to other states by the U.S. Government
                                to fulfill the 1962 Geneva agreements and to maintain the
                                independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of Laos sounds
                                unconvincing at the very least. You, Mr. President, directly admit
                                the presence of “American Military—air activities in Laos.” But
                                instead of the cessation of these actions your letter only poses the
                                question of international consultations. More to the point, for some
                                reason the U.S. Government did not raise the question of
                                international consultations when, last autumn, as a result of
                                American armed intervention, military operations in the Plain of
                                Jars and the central part of the country sharply intensified which
                                led to the seizure of a series of areas that for a long time were
                                under the control of the patriotic forces of Laos.</p>
                            <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0567"/>
                            <p>We cannot share also your appraisal of our position on the question
                                of holding consultations among the countries participating in the
                                1962 Geneva conference on Laos. Bilateral consultations and exchange
                                of opinions between governments on the question of the situation in
                                Laos take place almost continually. In particular our attitude
                                toward the February 28, 1970 message of Souvanna Phouma was
                                communicated to the Laotian representatives in Moscow and Vientiane.
                                A reasoned (motivirovanny) answer was given by us to the government
                                of England concerning the inappropriateness of sending message on
                                this question on behalf of the two Cochairmen. The Soviet Government
                                maintains contacts with appropriate socialist countries. As far as
                                we know, the British Cochairman also has exchanged opinions on this
                                question with a number of countries in addition to the Soviet
                                Union.</p>
                            <p>If the U.S. Government has in mind not this type of consultation but
                                the convening in one or another form of a conference of
                                participating states of the 1962 Geneva conference, then it is
                                completely obvious that the convening of such a conference is unreal
                                in present conditions, when there is going on a war unleashed by the
                                U.S.A. against the Vietnamese people as well as armed intervention
                                in the affairs of Laos and now also Cambodia. It is hardly possible
                                to deny this.</p>
                            <p>Let us take only the question of the representation of Laos at such a
                                conference. The Government of National Unity of Laos, established in
                                conformity with the 1962 Geneva agreements, would have to be
                                represented at it. But after all it is well known that at the
                                present time there is no such government. It is necessary to
                                recreate it, and only the political forces of Laos themselves can do
                                this. The patriotic front of Laos, in its March 6 statement,
                                proposed concrete measures aimed at the re-establishment of the
                                Government of National Unity and the restoration of peace in Laos.
                                Precisely in connection with this we expressed the opinion in our
                                March 13 letter that the matter of the normalization of the
                                situation in Laos should begin with consultation among the political
                                forces of Laos, and that a good foundation for these consultations
                                is the proposals advanced in the above-mentioned statement of the
                                patriotic front.</p>
                            <p>I would like to point out that our letter of 13 March in no way
                                contends that consultations among Laotian political forces can by
                                themselves, if left to their own, lead to the restoration of peace
                                there. As was justly pointed out in the March 6th statement of the
                                patriotic front, the war in Laos cannot be brought to a close and
                                the matter of a settlement will not get off dead center while the
                                U.S.A. continues bombing Laotian territory and generally interferes
                                in Laotian internal affairs.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Government has already stated its opinion concerning how
                                much American armed invasion in Cambodia has complicated the
                                situation in Indo-China as a whole. I do not intend now specially to
                                    <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0568"/>dwell on this question.
                                In this instance it is necessary only to note that this invasion
                                makes even more unreal raising the question of some kind of
                                “international consultations” on Laos.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion I would like to express great regret, which is shared
                                by my colleagues in our leadership, that the U.S. Government,
                                instead of taking realistic measures for the cessation of the war
                                against the Peoples of Indo-China and the establishment of peace in
                                Southeast Asia, has taken the the path of spreading this war. This
                                complicates the situation not only in Southeast Asia but in the
                                whole world and naturally cannot but affect also the relations
                                between our countries. I would like to express the hope that the
                                Government of the U.S.A. and you personally will arrive at the only
                                correct conclusion the cessation of interference in the internal
                                affairs of the People of Indo-China and the withdrawal of American
                                forces from this region. We are convinced that such a decision would
                                radically change the situation in this region in favor of peace and
                                would meet the interests of the whole world.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> memo argues: “The fact that
                            Moscow is now willing to advance beyond dead center on two questions
                            which the UAR has in the past been unwilling to confront and which
                            involve a long-resisted Egyptian surrender, in principle, of the
                            strongest Egyptian bargaining ploys against Israel, implies that the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has strong policy reasons for
                            moving to this position.” Since presumably the Soviets were willing to
                            use their new leverage with Cairo to extract these concessions, “the
                            resultant impression is that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            means to convey a signal of its desire to bargain seriously.”</p>
                        <p>Moscow's move is seen as having two immediate tactical advantages: <list>
                                <item>—First and foremost, it appears designed to force the U.S. to
                                    face up to the problem of its relationship with Israel. Moscow
                                    expected its move would complicate the U.S. decision on jets for
                                    Israel. But more important, Moscow may see this as the ultimate
                                    inducement to press Israel to withdraw.</item>
                                <item>—Second, it may have been calculated to remind us that no

                                <item>—It is assumed that the Soviets would not have made their move
                                    if they had not been prepared for a positive U.S. response that
                                    could eventually lead to a settlement on favorable terms.
                                    Moscow's postulated readiness to settle the Arab-Israeli problem
                                    rests on indications that they are still considerably worried
                                    about an Israeli attack against the Arabs and a possible
                                    American military involvement in future hostilities as well as
                                    the effect of heightened tension in the Middle East on important
                                    ongoing Soviet-American relationships in other fields.</item>

                                    no longer believes that its leverage with the UAR and other Arab
                                    states depends on opposing a settlement. Even with a settlement
                                    it is thought that Moscow would have many things going in its
                                    favor in the Middle East.</item>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> memo concludes that, even though
                            Soviet interest in dampening the Arab-Israeli dispute now seems
                            substantial, it is unlikely that it is strong enough for them to
                            willingly undercut the position they have so painstakingly and
                            expensively built up in the area. The new positions communicated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> imply that Moscow
                            means business <hi rend="italic">but</hi> that the deal will have to
                            meet Arab sensibilities on regaining their territories and on the
                            refugee problem. Finally, the Soviets will be anxious to keep the
                            diplomatic action in our bilateral channel in order to emphasize their
                            co-equal role with us in the region and as the best way to overcome both
                            Cairo's possible faintheartedness and Tel Aviv's probable
                            obstructionism.</p>

                        <p>While many of <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>'s points seem valid, it
                            seems to have been written out of the context of the record of the past
                            year's negotiations. A review of that negotiating history clearly
                            reveals that after 15 months of effort there has been little, if any,
                            net progress toward coming up with a joint document. It is true that the
                            Soviets have suddenly reopened the bilateral dialogue, which for all
                            practical purposes was suspended since late last October, but they have
                            done so in a way that attempts to wipe the slate clean of all we have
                            discussed over the last year.</p>
                        <p>The simple fact is that their new formulations are changes in <hi
                                rend="italic">their</hi> June 1969 document, which we felt we passed
                            in our drafts of last July and October. One of their two opening
                            concessions on the peace issue—Arab control of the fedayeen—is important
                            but it simply does not stack up to what they want us to do in return.
                            They want us to give away Israel's entire position on withdrawal before
                            the peace negotiations—which their document ignores—even begin.</p>
                        <p>It is correct, as the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> memo says, that
                            the Soviets have again signalled a desire to bargain. However, the terms
                            are such that I question whether we are yet within range of serious
                            negotiation unless the U.S. is prepared to press now for Israeli
                            acceptance of certain borders before negotiations begin. Moreover, while
                            I can find several strong incentives for the Soviets to keep the talks
                            open, I still see none that are compelling enough for them to back down
                            very far from the maximum Arab positions. I can see why they might want
                            to re-open the negotiating door as a safety exit because the potential
                            for their military involvement. But my guess is that they would like to
                            draw the present <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0571"/>situation out
                            just as long as they can—see the U.S. position eroded just as much as
                            possible—before they turn to political settlement.</p>

                            <item>I spent ninety minutes June 29 discussing our <gloss

                                Although <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> seemed
                                somewhat tired, he listened carefully through my presentation. He
                                put his remarks and questions to me in a direct, serious, and
                                non-polemical manner.</item>

                                    >Gromyko</persName> said he wished answers or clarifications to
                                several questions. First, the US says it would not be good if the
                                Arabs and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> put forward as a
                                preliminary condition for negotiations the demand that Israeli
                                forces must withdraw from all, he said, occupied territories. Is the
                                US against this demand as a general thesis or only as a preliminary
                                condition? It was, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                                added, very essential to have an answer to this question.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I said we would oppose the demand if it were a preliminary
                                condition for negotiations, simply on practical grounds. In any
                                event, it would not be attainable before negotiations could take
                                place since boundaries and the modalities of withdrawal were to be
                                the subject of <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0572"/>negotiations
                                themselves. If the Arabs insisted on their demand as a preliminary
                                condition, there would be little prospect of a political settlement
                                either through <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                mission or through major-power talks. I pointed out that the
                                principle of withdrawal and non-acquisition of territory is set
                                forth in UNSC Res 242, which we support. That res, however, does not
                                specifically stipulate withdrawal to the June 5, 1967, line.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>To seek a formula which goes beyond the wording of the Res, I
                                said, would delay the start of talks under <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> and slow down progress in
                                the major-power talks. Meanwhile, there would exist the danger of
                                military escalation and further reduction of our ability to be
                                helpful as a result of this delay. I added as final comment that the
                                US is already on record in its Oct and Dec documents as envisaging
                                no substantial changes in June 1967 lines, and that we endorsed
                                total Israeli withdrawal from UAR territory.</item>

                                to submit our proposals to the four-power talks in NY. I replied
                                that since all the appropriate parties had been apprised of our
                                proposals, I assumed they would be discussed at NY although I was
                                not certain as to how this would be done.</item>

                                answer to the latest Soviet proposals put forward in our bilaterals

                            <item>I said I was certain the Soviets would receive a reply. I went on
                                to say that what we were now proposing was an emergency procedure to
                                get talks started between the Israelis and Arabs. If they are
                                started, the two- and four-power talks would continue, aimed at
                                working out detailed instructions and bringing pressure and
                                influence to bear for the purpose of narrowing the gap.</item>

                                proposals, and could give no final answer now, particularly since
                                Moscow had not yet received detailed analyses of the US proposals
                                from appropriate Arab govts. He added that in general Moscow knew
                                their viewpoints.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then asserted that
                                the US proposals lack clarity on certain major questions. For
                                example, on the question of withdrawal of Israeli troops from all
                                occupied territories, he repeated his question, does the US oppose
                                this demand as a preliminary condition or as a general thesis? The
                                question of withdrawal of forces and the establishment of peace are
                                major questions to which clear US explanations are required, he
                                said.</item>

                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> mission—as does the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. The question arises of what will
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> be guided by in
                                carrying out his contacts with both sides. He needs detailed
                                guidelines. However, apart from the general provisions of UNSC Res
                                242 and a temporary ceasefire, the US proposals <pb n="540"
                                    xml:id="pg_540" facs="0573"/>contain nothing concrete, no
                                detailed instructions. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> went on to suggest that if the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> did not wish to work out guidelines
                                for <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> in our bilateral
                                channel, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> still felt
                                guidelines were necessary and that they could be worked out in the
                                four-power talks. Moscow would accept any form for working out
                                instructions so long as they lead to positive results.</item>

                            <item>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said,
                                Moscow still has not received reactions from Washington on some
                                other Soviet ideas, which perhaps were under study by the US. He
                                then reiterated that his preceding remarks were aimed at eliciting
                                clarification on a number of unclear points in the US proposals and
                                that his remarks had been of a preliminary nature. He would return
                                to a final assessment of the US proposals.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>I said we would take note of his questions and in the meantime I
                                would reply on the basis of information available to me. I went on
                                to say that the purpose of our proposals was to start the two
                                parties negotiating under <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName>'s auspices. No one could dictate. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> was there to launch the
                                negotiations, to mediate to the best of his abilities. If both sides
                                could, without qualification, accept UNSC Res 242, they could meet
                                indirectly under <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                mission. Meanwhile, if <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> needed assistance and guidance, this could
                                be provided by the two- and four-power channels.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>
                            <item>The essential thing, I stressed, was that the two sides be brought
                                together in a negotiating stance even if it is impossible at the
                                outset to give <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>
                                instructions. It was also our view that the problem will become
                                clearer more quickly once talks begin. The danger is that while we
                                wait for agreement on instructions in the two- and four-power talks,
                                the situation on the ground is likely to get worse and military
                                pressures on both the US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                will increase.</item>

                            <item>He then remarked that the US takes the position that the sooner
                                the talks start the better. However, he went on, experience shows
                                that if there is no agreement on guidance for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, there is no progress. The
                                Soviet Union does not want to put the damper on <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, whom it supports. However,
                                while Moscow wants the start of negotiations, it sees no point in
                                starting just for the sake of starting. Is it our goal, he
                                continued, to have <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> go
                                to the area and return without anything? <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> emphasized that among the govts which share
                                major responsibility there must be understanding and agreement
                                regarding the major tasks and questions. Otherwise there can be no
                                positive results.</item>

                            <item>I replied that if the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could
                                get Israel to accept UNSC Res 242, indirect negotiations, and the
                                principle of withdrawal, this would be a great step forward in
                                contributing to the start of negotiations. As regards the Arabs, I
                                referred to my initial presentation which pointed <pb n="541"
                                    xml:id="pg_541" facs="0574"/>out that under the US proposals we
                                are asking them to do no more than they themselves have earlier they
                                were prepared to do. Our proposals ask more of the Israelis than of
                                the Arabs. What we are proposing, I said, was an important
                                procedural step to break an impasse; an urgent initiative of this
                                type was called for. I added that the the two-and four-power talks
                                could at the same time deal with substantive questions.</item>

                            <item>After asking us again to reflect on the questions he had posed,

                                suggesting that we should give <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"

                                the establishment of peace. I replied that the first thing was to
                                get the parties together in negotiations which would clarify the
                                substance of the issues.</item>

                            <item>At reception last night for visiting Mayor Washington <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KGM1">Korniyenko</persName> made it clear that the
                                two major points the Soviets will hammer away at are (1) absence of
                                instructions for <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, and
                                (2) failure to deal with “the Arab demand for total Israeli
                                withdrawal.” Since the Soviets frequently offer lack of response as
                                an excuse for doing nothing, I suggest we again try to tie these
                                questions down as best we can.</item>

                            that we oppose the Arab demand for an Israeli commitment to total
                            withdrawal as a pre-condition to negotiations or to Four Power agreement
                            on guidelines for <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>. He
                            said we feel that the final borders must be agreed between the parties,
                            not imposed, but should exclude other than insubstantial changes.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> also said that we
                            wanted positive reaction from the parties before submitting our
                            proposals in the Four Power forum and that delaying tactics in hope of
                            getting the initiative changed through the major power talks would
                            simply not work. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                            noted that the new Soviet formulations (presented last March directly to
                            us and more recently in the Four Power talks) are a “step forward” and
                            our reply would be influenced by (1) whether the negotiating process
                            under <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> begins and (2) by
                            the degree of Soviet military aid to the Egyptians.<note n="4"

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> took the line that our
                            proposals were too thin and that in his opinion it would be best to
                            table our initiative in the Four Power talks where they could be
                            strengthened with the suggestions of other powers. Why, he wondered, had
                            the U.S. taken a unilateral initiative instead of discussing it first in
                            the major power forum, particularly when the Soviets had just made a
                            forthcoming move on the issue of peace that we had stressed so much.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed the
                            continuing Soviet interest in the U.S.–<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> talks and Moscow's disappointment over the delay in
                            the U.S. answer to the new Soviet peace formulations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In our official contacts with the Soviets on the new initiative, they
                            have at all levels indicated their suspicion of our strategy. A certain
                            measure of mutual suspicion is probably inevitable in dealing with the
                            Soviets, but in this case, it is probably increased by the timing of our
                            initiative which did come on the heels of what they regard as the first
                            real concession they have made in over a year of talks on the Middle
                            East. That concession (Arab control of the fedayeen) is only one aspect
                                <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0576"/>of the larger problem and
                            came with unacceptable strings attached (acceptance of the rest of the
                            Soviet proposals and especially a prior Israeli commitment to total
                            withdrawal) but it presumably was carefully weighed and probably
                            intended to draw us out from behind our inflexible position. Now, in the
                            Soviet eyes, we have responded, for all practical purposes, by
                            sidetracking the Two Power and Four Power channels in favor of a
                            unilateral and direct approach to the parties with essence of our
                            earlier proposals.</p>
                        <p>More important, however, than this Soviet suspicion, is their
                            concentration on the issue of total Israeli withdrawal. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> did not get directly into this
                            but from all indications, including Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>'s recent talk with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, this is why the Soviets keep
                            harping on fleshing out our initiative in the Four Power forum. Of
                            course, it might be natural to expect positions on both sides to harden
                            on this issue just before a possible negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The most important question for the Soviets, and for that matter for
                                <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>, is whether the U.S.
                            is prepared to press the Israelis to withdraw totally from the occupied
                            territories if the Arabs make the concession of agreeing to
                            negotiations. All of the Soviet talk about the need to give <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> more detailed guidelines really
                            boils down to the Soviets pressuring us to settle the boundary issue
                            before <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> resumes in
                            contrast to our insistence on having negotiations start before boundary
                            issues as Gaza, Sharm al-Shaikh and Jerusalem are worked out. This has
                            been the essence of the Soviet strategy in the Four Power talks for some
                            time and they apparently intend to pursue it in response to our new
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>The most important insight that comes to me out of the first week's
                            maneuvering over our initiative is this: It is, at the moment, little
                            more than an energetic effort to rush the Soviets and Egyptians to agree
                            to begin negotiation in hope that the U.S. will make the key concessions
                            on boundaries in return. We have hinted; but we have not decided. We may
                            not want to make that decision. But <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> sees the effort for what it is, and I will be
                            surprised if the Egyptians and Soviets let us get away with it. We are
                            asking them to play their key card with no more than a hint that we
                            might play ours in return.</p>

                            In this reply, the Soviet Government indicated that they would be
                            prepared to make an agreement at Vienna on <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                                >ABM</gloss>s and on the issue of accidental and provocative
                            attacks, but that they did not think it likely that an agreement could
                            be reached on the limitations of offensive weapons at Vienna. I wanted
                            to get clarification on that point.</p>
                        <p>I deliberately conducted the meeting in a somewhat cool and aloof manner.
                            I asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> how he explained
                            the first section of his Aide Mémoire. Did it mean that agreement on
                            offensive weapons was impossible or that agreement would be very
                            difficult? <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that in
                            view of all the important obligations that they had raised, the
                            offensive limitations would have to be dealt with in two stages—an
                            agreement in principle to be followed by detailed negotiations. He did
                            not believe that this could be accomplished in the three weeks that were
                            remaining in Vienna. He did want me to know, however, that the Soviet
                            leaders had shown their good faith by instructing Semyonov first, to
                            stay in Vienna at least until August 1st, and secondly, to concentrate
                            for a while on the provocative and accidental attack aspect in order to
                            give us a chance to develop our position.</p>
                        <p>I said to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that we were
                            going to have a meeting the next day to consider various aspects of the
                            matter, particularly whether we could agree to a separate <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> ban. I also told him that I noticed
                            that the last two paragraphs of his Aide Mémoire explicitly established
                            the concept of linkage which they had strenuously rejected the year
                            before. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that
                            they had become convinced by the persuasiveness of my argument that this
                            was a correct course. We left this part of <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545"
                                facs="0578"/>the conversation with my saying that I would let
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> know after the
                            meeting of our advisers whether we would agree to a separate <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> ban. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> added that, if that were done, the agreement
                            could be signed later on this summer by the Foreign Ministers, perhaps
                            at the United Nations. I said that this was a matter we could discuss
                            after there had been an agreement in principle.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then raised the subject
                            of the Middle East in a much more conciliatory way than in the previous
                            conversation where he said that the Soviets were practically out of it.
                            He said he couldn't understand why we made the statements we did in San
                                Clemente.<note n="4" xml:id="d177fn4">On July 1, while in San

                            have been best for us to keep quiet, but he wanted me to know that the
                            Soviet Union sought no confrontation and that the Soviet leaders were
                            eager to have a political settlement. I responded that somehow or other
                            I had gained the impression from our last conversation that he thought
                            that now that the US was negotiating with the Middle Eastern parties
                            directly, the Soviet Union was absolved of any direct responsibility.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that if he
                            gave that impression, he regretted it. He wanted me to know that he was
                            fully authorized to talk to me at any moment and to come to an agreement
                            with me. I said that I did not have enough time to discuss the Middle
                            East at this particular moment, but that when I gave him our answer on
                            the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> proposal, I would let him also
                            know about our thinking on the Middle East. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                considerations regarding the course of strategic arms limitation
                                talks in Vienna have been carefully studied in Moscow, and I am
                                instructed to outline the following considerations of the Soviet
                                side in this connection.</p>

                                    <p>Soviet-American strategic arms limitation talks have been
                                        underway for over two months now, and we agree with the
                                        opinion of the American side that the time has come to sum
                                        up certain results of the exchange that has taken place and
                                        to try to determine how these negotiations could be most
                                        productively continued.</p>
                                    <p>The Soviet Union views with importance the problem of
                                        strategic arms limitation and is prepared to conduct
                                        fruitful talks in this field. At the Vienna negotiations we
                                        have advanced a broad program of measures which is a
                                        comprehensive one and embraces all strategic arms systems
                                        capable of delivering nuclear strikes against targets on the
                                        territories of the sides. We have chosen this approach
                                        proceeding from the necessity of ensuring equal security for
                                        both sides which constitutes an indispensable condition for
                                        agreement.</p>
                                    <p>The proposals outlined by the US delegation have been
                                        carefully considered in Moscow. While those proposals have
                                        been presented to us as based on a broad approach to the
                                        problem of strategic arms limitation, we have noted that the
                                        American side proposes to include into the framework of
                                        agreement not all types of strategic arms leaving aside the
                                        question of US aircraft-carriers, aircraft and forward based
                                        missiles carrying nuclear charges, as well as of other
                                        systems the geographic location of which makes it possible
                                        to strike targets on the territory of the other side. Such a
                                        proposal, clearly, cannot be taken as a basis for solving
                                        the problem of strategic arms limitation because it would
                                        give advantages to one of the sides.</p>
                                    <p>A number of other proposals by the US side has also been
                                        aimed at attaining one-sided advantages. These include
                                        proposals to the effect that Soviet heavy missiles be
                                        singled out as one separate category and a special ceiling
                                        be placed on them, that a quantitative level for strategic
                                        bombers be secured to the advantage of the US, as well as
                                        proposals regarding a ban on mobile launch missiles,
                                        limiting wing missiles, Diesel submarines, etc.</p>
                                    <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0580"/>
                                    <p>With the view of surmounting the existing differences we have
                                        come out for, in case the US retains forward-based nuclear
                                        means, the Soviet Union's receiving an adequate
                                        compensation. Such compensation could take the form, for
                                        example, of quantitative reduction of corresponding
                                        armaments from the other side. However, before citing any
                                        specific figures in this connection it is necessary to come
                                        to terms in principle on all these questions.</p>
                                    <p>In analysing the situation at the talks one has to state that
                                        there exist differences between the sides which could be
                                        overcome only in the process of further thorough and
                                        all-round consideration. It is hardly possible to envisage
                                        that this could be accomplished at the present Vienna stage
                                        of the talks.</p>
                                    <p>We would like to hope that the US Government will again give
                                        thought to our considerations and arguments, outlined in
                                        Vienna, in favor of such comprehensive solution of the
                                        problem of strategic arms limitation that would ensure equal
                                        security for both sides.</p>

                                    <p>It has been noted in Moscow that certain points in common
                                        have emerged in the questions of limiting <gloss
                                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> development and of measures
                                        for reducing the danger of missile-nuclear war between the
                                            <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the US
                                        resulting from accidental or unsanctioned use of nuclear
                                        weapons.</p>
                                    <p>Considerations have been advanced from the American side
                                        concerning the possibility of reaching agreement on limiting
                                        the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems to two
                                        points/Moscow and Washington/. We are prepared to consider
                                        this proposal as a basis for obtaining agreement on the
                                        question of limiting deployment of the <gloss
                                            target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> systems.</p>
                                    <p>As regards specific questions which arise in this
                                        connection/number of launch installations, their location
                                        and the like/, these, in our view, could be agreed on
                                        without difficulties.</p>
                                    <p>The same applies also to the problem of reducing the danger
                                        of missile-nuclear war between our countries. The Soviet
                                        delegation in Vienna has necessary instructions for a
                                        concrete discussion on this question.</p>
                                    <p>In conclusion we would like to say that, in our profound
                                        conviction, one of the most important conditions for a
                                        successful development of the strategic arms talks which
                                        have such a paramount significance for the destinies of
                                        world peace, is the state of the international situation as
                                        a whole.</p>
                                    <p>It is believed in Moscow that for speedy achievement of
                                        agreement it is necessary in every way to avoid
                                        complications in the international situation and to apply
                                        all efforts to make healthier the world atmosphere. It
                                        should be emphasized that the Soviet side attaches great
                                        importance to this.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: Want an agreement on <gloss

                            about the Middle East—why did you raise it now? I told you I wanted to
                            talk to you. (Didn't raise it the last time I saw him.) He said come to

                        <p>P: Do you think he really is frightened?</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: Frightened, we are getting their
                            attention. After this thing, he said we will offer you these
                            (proposals?), he was drooling all over the place.</p>
                        <p>P: Nothing about Vietnam. Push him off, we will handle it ourselves. The

                            About the Russian SAMs, want to know how you can let them get away with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>(Three new SS–9s were mentioned)</p>

                        <p>After some desultory talk about my new office, I opened the conversation
                            by telling <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I had
                            followed the reporting from Vienna with great interest. As a specialist
                            in the Congress of Vienna,<note n="2" xml:id="d179fn2">In 1957,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> published <hi
                                    rend="italic">A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh, and the
                                    Problems of Peace, 1812–1822</hi>, which analyzed the Congress
                                of Vienna that established a post-Napoleonic European
                                settlement.</note> I could only congratulate Semyonov on having
                            learned some of the tactics. I referred specifically to the note he
                            handed over to <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> at a concert
                            which seemed almost to suggest a form of alliance between the United
                            States and the Soviet Union against countries that had engaged in
                            provocative acts. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            he did not know how the note was handed over, but of course, he was
                            familiar with the formulation.</p>
                        <p>I said that I looked at the accidental war problem on two levels: (1) the
                            technical means of notification which we were studying and which I did
                            not think would present any undue problem; and (2) the political
                            implications of some of the cooperative arrangements that they were
                            suggesting which represented a significant change in the international
                            environment as it had developed since the war. I wanted to talk to him
                            about that second aspect a little later, but I wanted first to turn to
                            the overall issue of <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> interjected to point out that
                            the formulation handed by Semyonov to <persName corresp="#p_SGC1"
                                >Smith</persName> had been prepared by the Delegation in Vienna. He
                            could tell me frankly that he, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>, had had his doubts about it because he was
                            afraid that too great significance was going to be read into it. If we
                            wanted an agreement without that particular clause, this would not
                            become a sticking point. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            indicated that the major political fact for the Soviet Union was an
                            agreement on provocative attack, not individual clauses, and there would
                            not be any undue haggling. I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that we should defer discussion of this until I
                            gave him our general view.</p>
                        <p>I said that the President had decided after careful study that it was not
                            possible to separate the components of a <gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss> agreement—that it was necessary to have a limitation
                            on offensive weapons together with a limitation on <gloss
                                target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>'s. We were prepared in principle to
                            discuss accidental war limitations. I added that recent missile starts
                            of SS–9 and <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0583"/>SS–11 groups
                            underlined for us the danger of an <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss>
                            limitation which would leave our Minutemen exposed to a Soviet
                            first-strike. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            I knew they didn't intend to make a first strike. I replied that I knew
                            no such thing, looking at their weapons deployment; in any event, it
                            didn't make any difference what I knew but what reasonable people could
                            deduce from the weapons situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he didn't
                            think it would be possible to come to an agreement under these
                            conditions. I replied that perhaps the delegations could be instructed
                            to emphasize the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> part to get that
                            out of the way. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked,
                            “Well, why not then agree on the partial accord after all?” I said this
                            was not possible for the reasons I had given to him. I added, however,
                            that I would be prepared to continue discussions with him during the
                            summer and that I was certain we could narrow the differences to a
                            manageable form. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said
                            that he would be prepared to do this but he thought that <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> was in essentially good shape and
                            that we could come to an agreement, if not this year, then in the early
                            months of next year. He emphasized again that they would be prepared to
                            drop any offending clauses in the accidental war part of the agreement,
                            that these were not matters of principle with them. I said that this was
                            not the issue—the issue to us was not to break out the defensive from
                            the offensive parts of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then raised the question
                            of how long the recess should be, saying that the Soviet Government
                            would prefer November 1st. I said we would prefer something like
                            September 15th. When <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            asked where that would leave us, I replied that it seemed self-evident
                            to me that it takes two to start a negotiation. He said he wanted us to
                            understand that the November 1st deadline was unconnected with any
                            deliberate attempt to slow down the talks, but had rather to do with the
                            internal operating methods of the Soviet government. Many of their key
                            people would be on vacation in August, and they would not be able to do
                            a systematic review until September.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also asked me what would
                            be new in our package. I said it was hard to go into precise detail, but
                            there would be a limit on offensive units and a sub-limit on heavy
                            missiles. He asked me how we would handle the problem of compensation,
                            i.e. the issue of the relationship between <gloss target="#t_IRBM1"
                                >IRBM</gloss>'s on their side and forward deployed tactical aircraft
                            on our side. I said it seemed to me the best way to handle it was
                            through exclusion—that they would not be counted on either side.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> indicated that this
                            would not present an insuperable difficulty. He again called my
                            attention to the part of the Soviet Aide Mémoire<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d179fn3">See the attachment to <ref target="#d177">Document
                                    177</ref>.</note> which said that an <gloss target="#t_ABM1"
                                >ABM</gloss> agreement could, in their view, be agreed on “without
                            difficulty.” He said this was a very significant statement. I <pb
                                n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0584"/>replied that I understood, and
                            that we should, however, now proceed to work as expeditiously as
                            possible on a comprehensive statement.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then turned to general subjects. I said that I wanted
                            him to know that the President had read the article that Semyonov had
                            handed to <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> at a concert with
                            the greatest care. He had come to the conclusion that the most
                            significant aspect of it would be the political one; however, such a
                            politically important matter should not be handled within the context of
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, but should be handled at a
                            higher level. I therefore wanted to return to my conversation of April
                                12th<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">No record of a meeting on that date
                                has been found. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> was
                                apparently referring to his April 14 meeting with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>.</note> in which I had
                            suggested a specific procedure for coming to an understanding of
                            fundamental issues so that major progress could be made. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> evaded the issue and said that
                            he had thought that Cambodia had ended this concern and, in any event,
                            he was prepared to discuss the Middle East with me.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Middle East and Summit Meeting</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He then launched into a long discussion of the Middle East. He said,
                            “Talking to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> is like
                            throwing beans against a wall,” which is allegedly a Russian proverb. On
                            the other hand, he said, <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> was
                            always totally uninstructed and only listened politely to what <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had to say, whereupon he would
                            then insist that he had to go for new instructions. He thought it was
                            essential that we come to a political agreement and he said he was fully
                            authorized to deal with me.</p>
                        <p>I stated that he still owed me an answer to the questions which I had put
                            to him three weeks ago. In contrast to his meeting with me just before
                            San Clemente,<note n="5" xml:id="d179fn5">See <ref target="#d171"
                                    >Document 171</ref>.</note> he now remembered the question very
                            well. He said, “Look at it, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                            >Henry</persName>; you have never stated a proposition to me of a
                            political settlement in the Middle East. All we have from you is one
                            question, namely, whether we will withdraw our troops in case of a
                            settlement. On the other hand, we don't know what you mean by a
                            political settlement.” I asked, “Do I understand then that if I tell you
                            what we understand by a political settlement, you will tell me that you
                            are prepared to withdraw your troops?” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> indicated that this might be a fair conclusion,
                            but he was not totally unambiguous about it. He said he thought that he
                            and I could settle the matter of the Middle East between ourselves. I
                            responded that I doubted that this would be possible because it was a
                            matter of extraordinary delicacy for us and we had to do it in the right
                            framework.</p>
                        <p>I then returned to the formulation at Vienna, but <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> turned the conversation by
                            saying that this was not the most crucial aspect. I finally <pb n="552"
                                xml:id="pg_552" facs="0585"/>got straight to the point and said as
                            follows: “<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoliy</persName>, when I spoke
                            to you on April 12th, you know very well that I was not talking about
                            how to handle the Middle East. We had made a specific proposal to you
                            about a meeting at the highest level. We are proposing this because it
                            is early enough in our Administration to have a fundamental departure in
                            our relationships with the Soviet Union. However, if too much more time
                            is spent, we are going to make whatever agreements we do at a point in
                            the Administration when they can no longer be effectively implemented.
                            Therefore, the decision is up to you, but there's no sense beating
                            around the bush.” <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> became
                            very serious and dropped his jocular manner. He said, “You recognize, of
                            course, that Cambodia and the approaching Party Congress make this a
                            difficult matter for us.” I said, frankly, I was looking at problems
                            from our point of view, and it was up to him to take care of his
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then stated that this
                            was a matter, of course, of the greatest importance which had to be
                            reported directly to Moscow, and he would want to sum up his
                            understanding: (1) the President was proposing a summit meeting; (2) the
                            summit meeting should consider a fundamental reappraisal of
                            American-Soviet relations. I said that was correct. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked when the meeting should
                            take place—were we thinking of 1971 or 1972? I replied, no; we were
                            thinking of this year. In response to his query, “before or after the
                            elections?”, I said that this was to be settled after we knew how it was
                            going to be discussed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked what the
                            agenda of a summit might be. I said, “<gloss target="#t_SALT1"
                                >SALT</gloss>, the Middle East, European security, and any other
                            issue that either party wanted to place on the agenda.” <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that if it is to be on
                            the Middle East, he and I had to make some agreement ahead of time to
                            see whether there was some progress. I said I was prepared to talk to
                            him. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether he
                            understood correctly that I would not be prepared to talk to him unless
                            there were to be a summit. I responded that I had no instructions on
                            that point, but that obviously the President's attitude would be
                            affected by how the Middle East would fit into the general picture.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said, “It is clear,
                            and I will report back to you.”</p>
                        <p>He then launched into a long discussion along familiar lines of Soviet
                            good faith in the Mid-East negotiations. He repeated that they had made
                            two significant concessions, both of which had been ignored. He said
                            they had always wanted to settle it with us. He insisted that the two
                            alleged concessions still stood, and that he had waited for us to give
                            him a response. In contrast to his previous meeting with me before we
                            went to San Clemente, he reiterated the urgent desire to settle the
                            Mid-East problem. He said, “I am authorized by the Soviet Government to
                            tell you that we seek no confrontation.” I replied, “I am authorized by
                            the American Government to tell you that we seek no <pb n="553"
                                xml:id="pg_553" facs="0586"/>confrontation. We were not threatening
                            you; we were stating an objective fact of the trend.” He said he wished
                            we hadn't used the word “expel,” for this had a tendency to make people
                            feel that their national pride was involved and issues of backing down
                            would be raised. I said that it was not a question of backing down but a
                            question of the objective reality in which, despite what the great
                            powers might want, events might force them on a collision course.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked me whether I
                            thought we were on a collision course now. I said that reluctantly I had
                            to conclude that we were.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reiterated that the
                            Soviet Union sought no confrontation and was prepared for a political
                            settlement. He said that while he did not know the details of Soviet
                            deployment in Egypt, he thought it had been blown up out of all
                            proportion, and the Soviet Union was not advancing forward. There were
                            shifts within a well-understood plan. On the other hand, he said, the
                            Soviet Union could not accept the proposition that air supremacy over
                            both sides of the Suez Canal was an Israeli right that could never be
                            challenged. I said, “Well, this is a point of disagreement between us,
                            but it is not one that we can settle now. The main point you have to
                            understand is that the introduction of Soviet combat personnel into
                            Egypt represents serious problems for us, and the more permanent it
                            appears, the more serious the problem grows.” I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also to remember that the
                            President moved circuitously, but that he eventually always did what he
                            said he would do. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said,
                            “It is clear, and we ought to try to work on a political settlement and
                            time is getting very short.” I said I agreed with him.</p>
                        <p>He then asked me whether we would be prepared to discuss a European
                            Security Conference at a summit. I replied that we probably would be.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then said that as
                            far as he could understand it, the agenda would be <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, European security, and the Middle
                            East; he told me that he would be back to me.</p>

                        <p>The meeting took place in an extremely cordial atmosphere. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s affability was much more
                            pronounced than at the meeting before we went to San Clemente, and his
                            eagerness to prove Soviet good faith was sometimes almost
                                overpowering.<note n="6" xml:id="d179fn6">On July 16, <persName

                                the military sense and perhaps this provides a good opportunity to
                                advance toward a settlement. He said the possibility for peaceful

                                Canal cannot be characterized as defensive, since their net effect
                                is to bolster UAR policy of violating the ceasefire. There is a
                                serious question whether new Soviet support of the UAR in the Canal
                                combat zone has not now led to a major qualitative change in the
                                military balance. Given the UAR policy of attacking along the
                                ceasefire line, we view Soviet activity as contributing to a serious
                                escalation of the conflict.</item>

                                believe. The Israelis have a definite purpose in doing so, and if

                                great problem. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has always
                                advocated its renewal if it could lead to successful results. The

                                several remarks to make about his comments. We were addressing our
                                appeal to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> because the
                                indications we had were that Soviet military support and activity in
                                the UAR has increased. The available evidence has impressed the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, which would not have raised
                                the issue if there were not a substantial increase, which creates a
                                more dangerous situation in the area. It is important that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is convinced of the validity
                                of the information and may have to act on it. The <gloss

                                preparing new deliveries to Israel. We have suspended action on the
                                Israeli request for more planes. We have done so in the interest of

                            <item>I said it was well known the UAR had repudiated the cease-fire and
                                was acting in violation of the ceasefire. Its actions are not purely
                                defensive in this sense. Soviet support and increased military aid
                                has changed and is changing the military situation between the Arabs
                                and the Israelis. This increases the possibility of undesirable and
                                unforeseen actions. Furthermore, it is forcing the <gloss

                                respect to Israel where we have, until now, shown restraint by not
                                escalating our military deliveries.</item>

                                us is impressive and very disturbing. I went on to say that I was
                                sure he would believe that the US is taking it seriously and that is
                                why we have spoken on sober terms in Moscow and Washington.</item>

                            <item>I then went on to point out that we were happy to note that the
                                Soviet Union, like the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, believes
                                in the necessity for political settlement of the situation in the

                                certainly no less interested in these points than the <gloss

                                thought they offered something to build on in the proper setting and
                                at the proper time.</item>

                            <item>I went on to stress that our initiative was not intended to set
                                aside the Two- or Four-Power talks or the Soviet proposals. It was
                                suggested as an emergency measure to bring the parties into
                                discussion on the basis of firm acceptance of UNSC Res 242. We were
                                not asking anything of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or
                                the Arabs to which they had not already agreed. On the other hand,
                                we were asking the Israelis to engage in indirect negotiations and
                                to commit themselves to withdrawal. The purpose was to revive the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> mission and to

                                to ask in what respect. I answered they had not brought the two
                                parties together, and our aim was to launch <persName

                                into discussion. We hoped our procedural suggestion would appeal to
                                all concerned as an emergency measure, as a way of escaping from a
                                dangerous situation. I stressed again that we wanted the Soviet govt

                                exacerbation of the situation but for finding a solution to the
                                problems of a political settlement. He then reiterated this
                                assertion that any undesirable developments in the <gloss

                                actions. He said that if there are hotheads in Tel Aviv who want to

                                the principle of withdrawal. However, what the <gloss

                                from all territories. What troops and what territories, these are
                                the main questions. The UAR does not want to discuss the issue if it
                                is only a question of withdrawal of Israeli troops from Sinai. In
                                the Soviet view, it would not be a very great advance if the <gloss

                                established by agreement. I went on to stress that our concern was
                                about the developing military situation. I said that if the Soviet
                                Union could provide clarification about the actual state of affairs
                                and its intentions, it might help to reduce our anxiety.</item>

                            covering my last conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. What is not contained in the telegram is that
                            I gave the Ambassador some personal impressions—strictly personal—of the
                            atmosphere which the continuing increased Soviet military involvement in
                            the UAR is creating which increases the risks of possible confrontation
                            with us. I said that it would be well for <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> to reflect that the President at the outset of
                            his Administration had declared an era of negotiations. For seventeen
                            months we had negotiated in good faith, and we feel that the Soviets
                            have not come half the way; and that our restraint on the military side
                            has not been met by restraint but rather by a fundamental decision on
                            the part of the Soviet Union to involve its personnel in an operational
                            capacity. This is a most serious decision for the Soviets to have taken,
                            and our concern has increased not only because of the creeping process
                            in recent weeks, but also because of Soviet unwillingness to tell us
                            quietly and confidentially what their intentions are and what the outer
                            limits of their involvement may be as they see it.</p>
                        <p>I said I had watched our President for months and felt that he had
                            offered political proposal after political proposal, and political
                            option after political option in the context of the United States
                            exercising great restraint in the face of pressures for providing Israel
                            with substantial numbers of additional aircraft. I hoped that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was not reporting to Moscow
                            that our involvement in Vietnam reflected any lack of resolve in the
                            Middle East. The President was a man of peace, a man who wanted a
                            negotiated settlement, but also a man of firmness and toughness, which
                            it would be well for the Soviet Union to take fully into account as it
                            develops Middle East policy. He would not be pushed around in the Middle
                            East or anywhere else. These were only personal judgments I was
                            expressing; but I would advise <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> to take very, very seriously the words
                            expressed by the President some months ago that the United States would
                            view with deep concern any attempt by the Soviet Union to dominate the
                            Middle East.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> responded critically of
                            the recent “tough talk” which he said would not force the Soviet Union
                            to make decisions of the kind it would not wish to make. He remonstrated
                            several times that the emphasis on the Soviet role was creating a crisis
                            atmosphere, and that it was not making it easier for Moscow to take
                            constructive initiatives during the current discussions with Cairo. At
                            the same time, he was quick to say, these were personal remarks and we
                            would be receiving the replies to our political initiative at an early
                            date.</p>

                        <p>I concluded this portion of the conversation by saying that I just wanted
                            personally to get this off of my chest, and that I had no authority to
                            say any of this. I wanted to say what I said because the Soviets in the
                            past have miscalculated regarding United States intentions and it was
                            important he reflected to Moscow the resolve and the fiber and the
                            determination of the President, as I read the situation.</p>

                            Middle East situation, although there are references to other major
                            world problems. Typical of such pronouncements, the communiqué is a
                            carefully worded document reaffirming mutual support and friendship and
                            shedding very little light on what actually transpired during <persName
                                corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName>'s extended talks with the Soviet

                            />significant aspects is the fact that the communiqué appears to align
                            the UAR with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> on a global basis
                            although not in every detail nor in every way.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There is almost no hint of conclusions reached and the U.S. initiative is
                            not even mentioned.</p>
                        <p>On the terms of a settlement, it is a standard reiteration of the
                            Egyptian position which the Soviets have long supported. The line is the
                            usual insistence that the establishment of a just and durable peace in
                            the Middle East can only be realized by the adoption of measures
                            insuring the cessation of Israeli “aggression” and the withdrawal of
                            Israeli forces from all occupied territory as well as the full
                            implementation of the November 1967 Security Council resolution and the
                            application of UN resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian
                            refugees.</p>
                        <p>On further Soviet aid to the UAR, there are no details. Continuation of
                            assistance is affirmed in general terms, and there is one reference to
                            the need for “urgent measures” to compel the Israelis to withdraw.</p>
                        <p>For the most part, however, the general tone is relatively calm,
                            unemotional and non-belligerent. There are, of course, some of the usual
                            references to “aggressive imperialistic forces” and their plots and
                            Israelis “aggressive and expansionist policy” supported by the U.S., but
                            this is not overdone. More notable is the recurrent stress on peaceful
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>It may be notable that, in addition to omitting any mention of the U.S.
                            initiative, there is no effort to respond to our statements from San
                                Clemente.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">See <ref target="#d177fn4"

                        </p>
                        <p>If anything, this statement seems to support the conclusion that we will
                            get at least a qualified reply to our initiative rather than a flat
                            rejection.</p>

                        <p>One of the more interesting aspects of the communiqué is its breadth in
                            mentioning a wide range of international issues.</p>
                        <p>On these other issues, it is substantively a rather routine document,
                            broadly alining <persName corresp="#p_NGA1">Nasser</persName> with the
                            Soviets but still preserving a good deal of distance between the UAR and
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. In particular, on European
                            questions, while the UAR joins the Soviets in applauding those who have
                            recognized the “sovereignty and independence” of both the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the GDR as well as approving
                            post-war European <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0597"/>borders (not
                            mentioned by name, incidentally), <persName corresp="#p_NGA1"
                                >Nasser</persName> is specifically not cited as endorsing Soviet
                            proposals for a European security conference. Nor is there in the
                            communiqué an overall attack on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            as would be normal between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            a Communist satellite. On the other hand, on subjects of long-standing
                            Soviet-UAR agreement—anti-colonialism, Rhodesia, South Africa—the
                            communiqué records the usual congruence of views. The U.S. is attacked
                            only once—for supporting Israel. <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>
                            is not mentioned, but the disarmament negotiations in Geneva in which
                            the UAR has generally supported the Soviets—and in which our differences
                            with the Soviets are not as great as in the past—are referred to
                            favorably.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The portion of the statement dealing with Indochina appears to be merely
                            pro forma and even somewhat moderate in some of its formulations. While
                            it reiterates the customary attacks on U.S. “interference” and
                            “aggression” it does not support the more extreme Hanoi position. It
                            merely describes Hanoi's ten points as a “a good basis” for a political
                            settlement. This could be attributed to a Soviet desire at this point to
                            distance itself somewhat from Hanoi's diplomatic moves, or might be
                            designed to conform to the general tone and content of the Soviet-UAR
                            communiqué itself.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was requested by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. He was extremely jovial and friendly, and
                            opened the conversation by asking me whether I could recommend any good
                            movies. I said no, I very rarely went. He said he had read reports that
                            “Patton” was very popular in <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0598"
                            />the White House. I replied that I had seen these reports also. He
                            asked how I compared “Patton” with the “Battle of Kursk” which he had
                            shown at the Motion Picture Association. I told him they were not easy
                            to compare. “Patton” was about a romantic hero and stressed the role of
                            the individual while the “Battle of Kursk” stressed the role of
                            matériel, not of the individual.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said the only individual
                            who really counted in World War II in the Soviet Union was Stalin, and
                            his great attribute was that he had absolutely iron nerves. He was the
                            one senior leader who refused to leave Moscow even though the Germans
                            were only 10 miles away and, by this act of defiance, he rallied a lot
                            of doubters. Also, Stalin had unbelievable powers of concentration. He,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, was a young aide in
                            the Foreign Office and he remembers that on the way to the Tehran
                            conference, Stalin gave orders to be left alone in his compartment. He
                            was not shown any documents and he sat there for three days, as far as
                            anyone knew just staring out of the window, thinking and concentrating.
                            Then, from the Soviet point of view, he gave an absolutely masterly
                            performance at Tehran.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also told me that Stalin
                            personally picked the Soviet Chief of Protocol in 1943 at the Tehran
                            Conference because there was a young Soviet diplomat who knew a
                            Churchillian idiosyncrasy which was always to ask for three Scottish
                            tunes from visiting bands that no one had ever heard of in order to
                            embarrass them. The young diplomat found out and when Churchill
                            requested these tunes, the Soviet honor guard was ready to play it.
                            Stalin asked who had thought this up and immediately appointed him Chief
                            of Protocol in the Foreign Office even though he was only 30 years old
                            at the time. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            he turned out to be the best Chief of Protocol the Soviet Foreign Office
                            had ever had. He added that being Chief of Protocol in the Soviet Union
                            was even more difficult than here because we had only one man in charge,
                            while after Stalin, placing the Soviet leaders in their proper order was
                            an act of political significance.</p>

                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s statement to
                            the effect that the US Government recognizes special interests of the
                            Soviet Union in Eastern Europe and has no intention to ignore or
                            undermine them due to the unrealistic nature of such a course. Those
                            are, without doubt, realistic judgments.</p>
                        <p>“Likewise, the Soviet Union is convinced that recognition of the
                            realities that have come into being in Europe, constitute that necessary
                            foundation upon which a stable peace on the continent as well as in the
                            world at large can and must be built.</p>
                        <p>“An important step on the way to strengthening peace in Europe would be
                            speedy preparation and convocation of an all-European conference on
                            problems of security and cooperation in Europe as proposed by the Soviet
                            Union and other European Socialist countries.</p>
                        <p>“It should be emphasized that the Memorandum adopted by the Governments

                            the wishes expressed by the American side both with regard to
                            participation of the US in the all-European conference and regarding
                            questions to be discussed at the conference or in connection with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>“Taking into consideration, in particular, the wishes of the US
                            Government the Soviet Government together with the other Governments
                            which adopted the said Memorandum, have come to the conclusion that
                            consideration of the question of reducing foreign armed forces on the
                            territory of European states would serve the interests of détente and
                            security in Europe.</p>
                        <p>“In our view, this question could be discussed in a body on questions of
                            security and cooperation in Europe which is proposed to be established
                            at the all-European conference. At the same time we are prepared to
                            discuss this question also in another manner acceptable to interested
                            states, outside of the framework of the conference. Such an approach
                            opens wide possibilities in selecting appropriate methods of <pb n="567"
                                xml:id="pg_567" facs="0600"/>discussing this question and takes into
                            account the experience that has already been accumulated in considering
                            outstanding problems of such kind, in particular between the <gloss

                        <p>“The questions of man's environment, which the American side is
                            interested in, could be, in our opinion, discussed within item 2 of the
                            proposed agenda for the all-European conference.</p>
                        <p>“We proceed from the assumption that in view of these clarifications the
                            United States should have no reason for delaying further convocation of
                            the all-European conference by way of presenting various preconditions.
                            We hope that the US Government will adopt a more constructive position
                            and will thereby contribute to making the preparation of the
                            all-European conference a more practical business.”</p>
                        <p>I asked what the phrase meant that in connection with a mutual balanced
                            force reduction, an approach “opens wide possibilities in selecting
                            appropriate methods of discussing this question” on a bilateral basis.
                            He responded that the choice of appropriate forums could be determined
                            after we had agreed in principle. He said he recognized that he owed me
                            some answers to other questions, and they would be forthcoming within
                            the next few weeks. I told him, of course, that I had to check my answer
                            with the President, and I wanted to remind him that I had listed
                            European Security as one of the three topics at our last conversation. I
                            thought the tone of his note was constructive, and we would try to
                            handle our reply in a constructive manner. I would let him know what the
                            response would be.</p>

                            had not yet presented our formal proposals and he wondered when they
                            could expect them. I replied that they would have them certainly the
                            next day, but they would be along the lines foreshadowed in my recent
                            conversation. He said he recognized that we would not split off <gloss

                            about the accidental war question. I told him that <persName

                            split off anything, but that I would be willing to explore with him
                            separating out of the accidental war question those issues which
                            concerned only our two countries, such as unauthorized launches of
                            missiles or mass flights of bombers, from issues that affected third
                            countries, such as the note Semyonov had handed to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> at a concert. I stated that there
                            might be a possibility of a limited technical agreement along these
                            lines, but that <persName corresp="#p_SGC1">Smith</persName> was not
                            authorized to negotiate it. This would have to be done between <persName

                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would come back to me

                            of Laos. He said he had read press reports that we were planning a

                            />What was there to such reports? I replied, “<persName

                            you suspect us of planning a military operation. Nothing I say will
                            convince you. If we are not planning one, it would be stupid for me to
                            say anything, so I will not talk about military operations.”</p>
                        <p>He said he didn't think we would launch one, but that there was a chance
                            that the South Vietnamese would launch one. I asked him why he raised
                            the question. He replied that he wanted me to understand that the Soviet
                            Government attached the greatest importance to the neutrality of Laos.
                            He thought we could work cooperatively for a solution of that problem
                            and he wanted us to know that this was the spirit of the Soviet
                            Government. I stated we were in favor of both Laos and Cambodia being
                            neutral. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said Cambodia
                            was a much tougher problem and perhaps the way to get at it was first to
                            assure the neutrality of Laos. I said I'd always be willing to listen to
                            specific proposals.</p>
                        <p>He then asked about <persName corresp="#p_NVT3">Thieu</persName>'s
                            readiness to have a coalition government. I replied our position on that
                            subject was well known, but that I would hardly have talked to Le Duc
                            Tho if we were not prepared to have serious discussions. It was up to
                            Hanoi to meet us with equal seriousness.</p>

                            means on the basis of the UN Security Council Resolution of November 22,
                            1967. With this aim in mind the Soviet Union repeatedly introduced
                            proposals directed towards practical implementation of this
                            Resolution.</p>
                        <p>“The U.S. Government declares now that it agrees to a resumption of the
                            mission of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>,
                            Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in the Middle East.
                            It is well known that the Soviet Government has always insisted on the
                            necessity of carrying out the mission entrusted with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, that it put forward
                            appropriate proposals to this end and made efforts so that his mission
                            be effective enough.</p>
                        <p>“That is why the Soviet side not only holds no objections to this effect
                            but, on the contrary, it reiterates its position with regard to the
                            necessity of resumption by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName> of his mission. Positively evaluating the
                            possibilities in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s mission, we are ready to go on making
                            contribution in the future as well so that <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570"
                                facs="0603"/>contacts between the sides through <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> which could be resumed in the
                            nearest future could produce positive results.</p>
                        <p>“As we know, the Governments of the UAR and Jordan have expressed their
                            readiness to cease fire for a definite period of time if Israel also
                            takes upon herself the same obligation. The Soviet Government's attitude
                            to this is positive.</p>
                        <p>“Undoubtedly, the success of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s activities requires that both sides
                            unequivocally declare their readiness to implement the above mentioned
                            Resolution of the Security Council in all its parts. The Soviet side
                            hopes that the American side is being guided by the same motivations.
                            The Governments of the UAR and Jordan have repeatedly stated and are
                            confirming now that they are ready to implement the Resolution in all
                            its parts. Therefore it is necessary that Israel should also clearly
                            state her readiness to implement this Resolution. Otherwise the sides
                            would find themselves in an unequal position: one of them does recognize
                            the November Resolution of the Security Council and expresses its
                            readiness to implement it while the other side ignores it.</p>
                        <p>“At the same time in the interests of success of <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s mission it is important that
                            he should have a definite enough understanding as to the basis upon
                            which contacts should take place between the sides in search of ways to
                            implement the Resolution of the Security Council. For the success of
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s mission first of
                            all a direction is required on the main questions of settlement—the
                            withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied during the
                            conflict of 1967, including the question of secure and recognized
                            boundaries along the lines which existed prior to the conflict in June
                            1967, and the simultaneous establishment of a just and stable peace in
                            the Middle East. The U.S. Government, on its part, has also repeatedly
                            emphasized the utmost importance of the above mentioned questions. Both
                            of these questions are organically connected with each other and should
                            be considered jointly. Appropriate proposals to this effect have been
                            put forward by the Soviet Government in the course of Soviet-American
                            exchange of opinion on June 2<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> and also at the
                            four-sided consultants in New York. The American side has not given so
                            far its reply to the above mentioned proposals—neither in the course of
                            bilateral exchange of opinion nor at the four-sided consultations. Yet
                            these proposals are in complete conformity with the Security Council
                            Resolution and the Soviet Government is expecting a reply from the U.S.
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>After making his oral statement, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> commented as follows, presumably on
                            instructions from his Government:</p>
                        <p>“Our statement has been made in the expectation that the American
                            Government will, indeed, make necessary efforts towards achieving a just
                            political settlement of the Middle East problem and will exert due
                            influence upon Israel.</p>
                        <p>“Besides, we are taking into consideration the clarifications by the
                            American side that—with <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s
                            activities resumed—the bilateral consultations will continue and that
                            the American side will show an active and constructive approach to the
                            discussion of matters of settlement in the Middle East both in the
                            course of the four-sided and of the bilateral consultations.”</p>
                        <p>After thanking <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, the
                            Secretary recalled that one of the important considerations in our
                            proposal regarding a ceasefire was that each side would commit itself
                            not to improve its military position. The Secretary said we assume that
                            a military standstill as part of the cease-fire is also acceptable to
                            the Soviet Union. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            responded affirmatively adding, “Yes, of course.” It was his
                            understanding that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_RM8"
                                >Riad</persName>'s statement to the Secretary covered this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Soviet side saw any objections to
                            releasing the Arab response to our initiative. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that it was his
                            understanding that the UAR did not intend to publicize its response. In
                            any event, he suggested that this matter be raised with the Egyptians.
                            The Secretary said it would be helpful from our standpoint to make
                            public the simple UAR statement accepting our proposal. He understood
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s remarks to mean
                            that publicizing the response would be acceptable to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> if this matter could be worked out
                            with the UAR. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            he did not anticipate any objections from the Soviet side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary added that the U.S. would do its part in support of
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> to bring about a
                            settlement, and he indicated our willingness to continue the Two and
                            Four-Power talks. The Secretary said that he viewed the Soviet's
                            response as an indication that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            was interested in a peaceful settlement. Such a settlement would be in
                            the mutual US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> interest and in the
                            interest of the world community.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed that the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has no objections whatsoever to
                            having <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> resume his mission
                            in a few days. He wanted to be sure that the U.S. understood that the
                            comment in the oral statement referring to the absence of a U.S. reply
                            to the Soviet June 2nd proposals was not meant to be a Soviet
                            precondition for resumption of <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s mission.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked whether the U.S.
                            Government had had any reply from Israel. The Secretary indicated that
                            we would inform <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> as soon
                            as we could regarding his query.</p>

                            in his capacity as Acting Dean of the Diplomatic Corps for the reception
                            of President Kekkonen.<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">President Urho

                            had called me earlier to tell me that he had been instructed to deliver

                            Department. But, as a matter of courtesy, he wanted to leave a copy with
                            me two hours before then. I therefore suggested to him that he join me
                            in the Map Room after the ceremony.</p>
                        <p>In the Map Room, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                            extremely cordial and asked me whether I was now optimistic about the
                            Middle East. I said, “I'm always realistic—neither optimistic nor
                            pessimistic.” He asked me what I thought would be a logical place for
                            the conference to occur. I said it might be Cyprus or New York.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that he felt
                            the Soviet Union would prefer New York, but it was not a key issue.</p>
                        <p>He then handed me the Soviet note<note n="3" xml:id="d185fn3">The note is

                        <p>Perhaps the most important element in the Ambassador's exchange with the
                            Secretary was <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s
                            categorical assurance that the cease-fire will also include a military
                            standstill. As we defined “standstill” in describing our initiative last
                            month, that would mean no major troop movements and no new installations
                            in the combat zone. This will be a key element in our approach to the
                            Israelis.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet response is: <list>
                                <item>—mild and non-polemical in tone;</item>
                                <item>—substantively complementary to the UAR response;</item>
                                <item>—tantamount to a Soviet endorsement of the UAR acceptance with
                                    no unexpected hookers.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>While they do not refer explicitly to our formula for beginning of talks
                            under <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, they say that they
                            favor both a cease-fire and resumption of <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                >Jarring</persName>'s mission.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets have emphasized—as did the UAR—that it is essential for the
                            Four Powers to provide <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>
                            with detailed guidelines. The next major issue then—if the details of
                            the cease-fire were confirmed and the Israelis accepted—would be debate
                            over how detailed the U.S.-Soviet agreement should be before <persName
                                corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> begins talks. The <pb n="574"
                                xml:id="pg_574" facs="0607"/>U.S. would have a case for resumption
                            on the basis of its formula alone, but the Soviets could slow the
                            beginning of a substantive exchange pending more detailed U.S.-Soviet
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>To put the Soviet reply in perspective, it must be kept in mind what the
                            Soviets are gaining and what they are conceding.</p>
                        <p>They would be getting <hi rend="italic">indirect</hi> talks started—if
                            the Israelis accepted—and would be getting Israelis acceptance of at
                            least the principle of withdrawal. Whatever that may mean in precise
                            terms, it is more restrictive rather than less. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> also seems to see greater promise
                            than in the past that the U.S. is prepared to press Israel. If it is
                            genuinely concerned about further military escalation, it is also
                            getting an opportunity to stop the shooting while the Soviet involvement
                            appears on a rising trend of effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>They would be conceding a commitment to talk without a precise U.S. or
                            Israeli commitment to total withdrawal. If they honored the military
                            standstill, they would be stopping short of depriving Israel of air
                            supremacy over the Suez combat zone. They would also be accepting the
                            success of a unilateral U.S. initiative to get talks started. While they
                            have their own image of increasing military effectiveness along the Suez
                            Canal to rest on, they could also appear to have been influenced by the
                            firm stand taken in San Clemente. They would also appear to be
                            acknowledging tacitly their own desire to limit their military
                            involvement.</p>
                        <p>Above all, of course, it must be remembered that the Soviets will be in
                            an advantageous position if Israel does not accept. If Israel accepts,
                            the U.S. will have brought the situation over the first major political
                            hurdle but there will still be the cease-fire to be defined in credible
                            terms and hard bargaining ahead on both sides, perhaps even before a
                            serious substantive exchange can begin.</p>

                                        This may partly result from a slip in Egyptian coordination.
                                        The main point is Soviet endorsement of the cease-fire. What
                                        remains imprecise is whether both Egyptians and Soviets
                                        accept the U.S. definition of cease-fire to include military
                                        standstill—no major troop movements and no new

                                        The UAR and Jordan have declared their readiness. It is

                                        of uncertainty. There has been a theological argument for
                                        more than two years over the word “implement.” Because the
                                        UAR claims that the Security Council resolution intends
                                        total Israeli withdrawal, it contends that agreement to
                                        “implement” the resolution is agreement to total withdrawal
                                        and that all that is needed is a timetable for withdrawal.
                                        Because the Israelis claim that the resolution only intends
                                        negotiation of an agreement on final boundaries, it has
                                        refused to use the word “implement.” We have supported the
                                        Israeli argument that negotiation must precede
                                        implementation. The element of uncertainty grows from the
                                        fact that the U.S. formula for beginning talks—which the UAR

                                    attention of your Govt.</p>
                                <p>B. The Soviet Union has always proceeded and proceeds from the
                                    conviction that a way can and must be found toward a political
                                    settlement of the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> conflict and
                                    thereby the elimination of the danger which has been created in
                                    this region. This is our firm position. One would wish that the
                                        <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would also adhere to
                                    such an approach.</p>
                                <p>C. As we have already repeatedly stated to the American side, we
                                    consider that the establishment of a firm peace in the <gloss
                                        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> by means of a political

                                    the countries which are direct participants in the conflict, as
                                    well as the interests of the USA and <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                        >USSR</gloss>. Only in this way can the existence and
                                    independence of all states of this region, including Israel, be
                                    guaranteed. It goes without saying that such a political
                                    settlement implies (Podrazumevayet) the withdrawal of Israeli
                                    troops from all the territories which they are occupying. It
                                    would not be realistic to count on firm peace in the <gloss
                                        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> without this.</p>
                                <p>D. All Soviet proposals during the exchange of views with the
                                    American side, including also our most recent proposals on the
                                    key questions of a settlement, to which the American side until
                                    recently has attached—in its words—great importance, have been
                                    aimed at achieving the goals of a just political settlement in
                                    the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>. And if now the bilateral
                                    Soviet-American exchange of views has been halted, then this is
                                    not at all our fault. It is then turn of the US to answer our
                                    most recent proposals, during the formulation of which the
                                    desires of the American side also were taken into account.</p>

                                    statements recently by American officials, assertions are

                                    without contradicting facts and common sense, it is impossible
                                    to prove that the actions aimed at halting Israel's continuing
                                    aggression against neighboring Arab states—whatever parts of the
                                    territories of these states such action touch upon—do not have a
                                    defensive but some other kind of character. In that connection,

                                    logic, then it turns out that when the Israeli air forces were
                                    able to bomb with impunity the UAR's territory, this was
                                    considered by the US as evidence of some sort of “balance,” but
                                    when they are deprived of such a possibility, this is declared
                                    to be a “dangerous violation of the balance.”</p>
                                <p>F. Such a logic, of course, suits Israel, which is not squeamish
                                    about disseminating various sorts of concoctions for its
                                    provocative purposes. But when statements, which obviously do
                                    not correspond to the real state of affairs, emanate from the
                                    American side, then, naturally, the question arises: what
                                    purposes are being pursued by this. If this is being done in the
                                    hope of somehow “justifying” further steps for rendering
                                    military support to Israel, the consequences of such a course of
                                    action and the responsibility which would lay on it in this
                                    instance should be clear to the <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                        >USG</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>G. Thus, in confirming its firm policy of searching—together with
                                    the USA, given its readiness for this—for ways for a peaceful
                                    political settlement in the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>,
                                    the <gloss target="#t_SOVGOV1">SovGov</gloss> deems it necessary
                                    to state that an undesirable development of events in the <gloss
                                        target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> can take place only in the event
                                    that it will be caused by corresponding actions of Israel and in
                                    the event the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> desires this.
                                    We do not see other reasons for an unforeseen development of
                                    events in the way of exacerbating the situation in this region.
                                    One would hope that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will
                                    act, carefully weighing all circumstances, and will be able to
                                    cool the ardor of those hotheads in Tel Aviv who would like to
                                    undertake new, dangerous provocations.</p>
                                <p>H. As regards the question of activation of the <persName
                                        corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> mission, we do not see
                                    great difficulties in this question. We have always advocated
                                    the maximum use of the possibilities of this mission and we are
                                    for its success, about which the <gloss target="#t_SOVGOV1"
                                        >SovGov</gloss> once again informed the <gloss
                                        target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> on July 23. But the main thing
                                    is the essence of the questions of a settlement, which is the
                                    goal also of <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s
                                    mission, and the essence of the positions of the states on these
                                    questions. <hi rend="italic">End text</hi>.</p>

                                this statement to Washington. I then said that, regarding the
                                suspension of bilateral talks, no blame or accusations had been
                                made. The reason related to the presentation of our initiative, to
                                which we now have UAR and Soviet responses.</item>

                            <item>Regarding the two statements I had made, their aim was to seek
                                clarification of Soviet military programs in the UAR. We had no
                                ulterior motives, or intentions to cover up further US deliveries to
                                Israel. In this respect, in fact, we have shown restraint regarding
                                new deliveries. We were seeking information and clarification from
                                the Soviets in order to be reassured that the military situation in
                                the <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> would not escalate. I said we

                                >Gromyko</persName>'s statement and Washington would have to
                                determine its significance and whether it provided us with more
                                information.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said if <gloss

                                of tension, the first step would be to influence Israel to give a
                                positive reply, to state in clear terms that it accepts and will
                                fulfill UNSC 242. Israel should do what the UAR has done. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he did not know if
                                Jordan had replied yet. Then, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> continued, <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> presumably should go somewhere and meet with

                                thing was the substance of the matter. The Arabs will be asking
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> what is the
                                nature of the Israeli and US positions. If <persName

                                know how long negotiations would continue. Therefore, agreement
                                should be reached—and the sooner the better—on the platform by which
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> should be

                                the first step was to gain acceptance by both sides of UNSC 242. If
                                we could bring this about, <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> would have a useful basis to begin his

                                proposals. (He obviously had in mind their new formulations on
                                peace, State 102698; and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                    >Dobrynin</persName>'s June 2 meeting with the Secy, State

                                He then said that Amb <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"

                                action shifting to <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> pressed the point
                                that the Four-Power talks must continue, in order to provide the
                                basis for the beginning of <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName>'s negotiations. Without such guidance, there
                                was the danger that the contacts would not result in anything.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> expressed the
                                view that mere acceptance by the parties of UNSC 242 would not be
                                enough for success. <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>
                                would have to have in his possession recommendations worked out in
                                the Four-Power talks. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                    >Gromyko</persName> indicated Moscow would not object to

                            <item>I again pointed out the importance as a basis for <persName
                                    corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>'s mission of having both
                                sides accept UNSC 242. By way of example, I drew his attention to
                                the fact that Bunche had undertaken his earlier <gloss
                                    target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> mission without detailed guidance.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> responded by
                                saying the situation was much more complicated now.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Rather than continue this aspect of the discussion to the point
                                where <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> might feel
                                compelled to say that the Four-Power talks would have to provide
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> with instructions
                                before he could begin his negotiations, I said that we would

                            is that we are prepared to do this one but it should be on a mutual
                            basis and take into consideration the political settlement.</p>

                            discussions on European matters, you and I, and it would be useful to
                            clarify some of that. The President has asked me to let you know of our

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: Well, I would think fairly soon after
                            that but it would be helpful to have you where we can talk to you,
                            particularly on the issue which you brought back in your message to me.
                            I think that would be easier to discuss on a restricted basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">D</persName>: Yes. This is out of question.
                            I was thinking on the more diplomatic side.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: What way? Do it in Moscow?</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: Yes. If I may make suggestion, it would
                            be extremely helpful if you would exercise restraint.</p>

                            went home to Moscow on major issues. There will definitely be no answer

                            much that you have the advantage over us. I will be dealing with

                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: Just wanted to tell you I have talked
                            to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">
                                <ref target="#d188">Documents 188</ref> and <ref target="#d189"
                                    >189</ref>.</note> and I just told him we considered his

                                    >footnote 3, Document 185</ref>.</note> I said be absolutely
                            sure it stays in channel. I said we would get answer to big question
                            when he returns. He said he hoped we would not surprise him as the last
                            time. I said unless our friends in Hanoi do something, we anticipated
                            nothing. He was slobbering all over me. He said he and I would have a
                            lot of business when he returns.</p>
                        <p>P: You figure about three weeks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: About the middle of August.</p>
                        <p>P: What we mainly want to do is keep all of this in strictest of
                            confidence. On the Middle East thing, it may break. If we could just
                            keep the situation confused for a while—keep it from breaking down.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: On the one hand, keep it confused but
                            also keep the Israelis from starting something and also from telling so
                            much that the Israelis would bring their troops out. That would be a
                            tremendous coup.</p>
                        <p>P: A reduction of arms too. That would put the Israelis in a pretty good
                            position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: I talked with Bill [Rogers] several
                            times about his conversation with Rabin. I am going to stay out of it.
                            We have given Rabin assurances on the first two points. Bill is working
                            the rest out. We will get answer today or tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>P: It will be interesting. You gave him exactly the right line. We are
                            not going to be quiet if other side does something.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: I think they want meeting as much as we
                            do. They didn't have to give us these two answers.</p>
                        <p>P: I have the feeling that they want a meeting to solidify their
                            framework. More and more they have historical perspective. They cannot
                            look without concern on the enormous colossus of China. Also they feel
                            that the Chinese may not give a damn. They could not only wipe out 20 or
                            30 Russian cities. What do they care.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: They could march into Siberia. That is
                            pretty unpopulated.</p>
                        <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0618"/>
                        <p>P: It is desolate there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_K1">K</gloss>: Things are certainly travelling much
                            more than we thought they would.</p>
                        <p>P: We must be quite firm but not give them anything to bitch about. I
                            know that their position is not changed.</p>

                        <p>You will recall that I mentioned to you earlier this week that the
                            Soviets had given us a forthcoming note concerning their “military
                            presence” in Egypt. I think you will be interested in seeing the exact
                            text of the message, which was delivered in Washington and is attached
                            at Tab A.</p>
                        <p>In a telephone conversation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> he stressed, as the note does, the cosmetic
                            importance to Moscow of making the removal of military presence a mutual
                            obligation. When I pointed out that we do not have such a military
                            presence, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied, “Then
                            it is better for you.” He also reiterated the willingness of the Soviets
                            to discuss regional arms limitations and the great importance his
                            government places on contacts with us on the Middle East, both in our
                            channel and generally.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I had
                            informed you of his message, that we thought it was a constructive
                            reply, and that we will be using my contacts with him more often on the
                            Middle East issues.</p>

                            <p>Referring to our previous conversations the following is authorized
                                by Moscow to be transmitted to the President.</p>
                            <p>Since <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> expressed his wish
                                to know the intentions of the Soviet Government regarding the
                                prospects of the Soviet “military presence” in the UAR we would like
                                the President to recall that it was not the Soviet Union who
                                initiated the arms race in the Middle East. We have always believed
                                and believe now that appropriate steps towards limiting this arms
                                race would not contradict the interests of countries of that area.
                                At the same time, for obvious reasons, we can not discuss the
                                question of unilateral assurances from the Soviet side in terms of
                                our accepting any preliminary conditions.</p>
                            <p>As we already stated to the US Government earlier, the Soviet side
                                would be ready to discuss the question of limiting the shipments of
                                arms to the countries of the Middle East after a political
                                settlement has been achieved. At that time the question of “military
                                presence” in that area of the world by non-Mideastern countries
                                could probably also be considered. Naturally, in this case it would
                                be a matter not only for the Soviet Union but also for other states
                                involved to assume appropriate obligations.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet side regards its contacts with the American side on the
                                Middle East question as very important ones and sincerely wants

                        <p>I saw Vorontsov at his request. He had called in San Clemente to say that
                            he wanted to have an appointment as soon as I got back. When I saw him,
                            he was extremely cordial and read me the attached communication from the
                            Soviet Government. I asked him on what this was based. He replied that
                            there had been many news stories about the American determination to
                            defend Guantanamo and many incorrect allegations about Soviet buildups
                            in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I asked in what way he thought we should confirm the understanding and
                            what he thought the understanding was. He said an oral statement from me
                            would be enough and he took the understanding to be that we would not
                            invade Cuba by military force. I said I would have to discuss the matter
                            with the President and let him know.</p>
                        <p>There was then some desultory conversation about <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. Vorontsov said he knew the
                            Kremlin was taking my recent communications extremely seriously, and
                            that he thought matters were now on a good turn. Vorontsov is, of
                            course, without any authority to negotiate and therefore he sticks
                            strictly to his instructions.</p>

                            <p>The increase lately in the United States of activity hostile towards
                                Cuba could not but attract attention in Moscow. Certain anxiety has
                                been caused, in particular, by attempts to unite various groups and
                                organizations of Cuban counterrevolutionary emigration in the United
                                States and by resuming of sabotage and subversive activity of these
                                organizations against Cuba, directed from American territory among
                                other places. There has been an increase in number of provocative

                                press and of ambiguous statements on the part of certain officials
                                of the United States.</p>
                            <p>We would like to stress that in the Cuban question we proceed as
                                before from the understanding on this question reached in the past,
                                and we expect that the American side will also strictly adhere to
                                this understanding.</p>

                                    5; it claimed that two boats hired by exiles in Miami would try

                            indicate clearly that there was an implicit understanding that we would
                            agree to give assurances against an invasion of Cuba if the Soviet Union
                            would remove its offensive missiles from Cuba under UN observation and
                            would undertake, with suitable safeguards, to halt the re-introduction
                            of such <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0624"/>weapons systems into
                            Cuba. However, the agreement was never explicitly completed because the
                            Soviets did not agree to an acceptable verification system (because of
                            Castro's opposition) and we never made a formal non-invasion pledge. The
                            negotiations between McCloy and Kuznetzov, which were designed to work
                            out a satisfactory means of formalizing the <persName corresp="#p_KRT1"
                                >Kennedy</persName>–Khrushchev “understanding” eventually just
                            fizzled out.</p>
                        <p>The “understanding” we have with the Soviets, therefore, is an implicit
                            one, which was never formally buttoned down. In fact, the Soviets
                            removed their missiles and there is no evidence that they have
                            re-introduced them; and we, of course, have not invaded Cuba.</p>

                            <p>“If assurances were given by the President and the government of the
                                United States that the USA itself would not participate in an attack
                                on Cuba and would restrain others from actions of this sort, if you
                                would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything. I
                                am not speaking for Fidel Castro, but I think that he and the
                                government of Cuba, evidently, would declare demobilization and
                                would appeal to the people to get down to peaceful labor. Then, too,
                                the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no
                                threat, then armaments are a burden for every people. Then, too, the
                                question of the destruction, not only of the armaments which you
                                call offensive, but of all other armaments as well, would look
                                different.”</p>
                            <p>… “I propose: We for our part will declare that our ships, bound for
                                Cuba, will not carry any kind of armaments. You would declare that
                                the United States will not invade Cuba with its forces and will not
                                support any sort of forces which might intend to carry out an
                                invasion of Cuba. Then the necessity for the presence of our
                                military specialists in Cuba would disappear.” (<gloss

                                United States on its part, considering the uneasiness and anxiety of
                                the Soviet state, will remove its analogous means from Turkey.</p>

                                to achieve this. After this, persons enjoying the confidence of the
                                U.S. Security Council might check on-the-spot fulfillment of the
                                pledges assumed. Of course, the authorization of the Governments of

                                promise to respect the inviolability of the frontiers and
                                sovereignty of Turkey, not to interfere in its internal affairs, not
                                to invade Turkey, not to make its territory available as a
                                bridgehead for such an invasion, and will also restrain those who
                                contemplate perpetrating aggression against Turkey both from the
                                territory of the Soviet Union and from the territory of other
                                neighbor states of Turkey.</p>
                            <p>“The U.S. Government will make a similar statement within the
                                framework of the Security Council in respect to Cuba. It will
                                declare that the United States will respect the inviolability of the
                                frontiers of Cuba and its sovereignty, undertakes not to interfere
                                in its internal affairs, not to invade, and not to make its

                                and will also restrain those who might contemplate perpetrating

                                States and from the territory of other neighboring states of

                                limit. Let us agree to some period of time, but not to delay—two or
                                three weeks; not more than a month.</p>

                                of them to the detriment of the United States is excluded… . if
                                there is no invasion of Cuba or attack on the Soviet Union or any
                                other of our allies, then of course these means are not and will not
                                be a threat to anyone, for they are not there for the purpose of
                                attack.”</p>

                                to the Soviet Union. As I had informed you in the letter of October

                            <p>“More resolute steps should be taken now to move towards finalizing
                                the elimination of this tension, i.e. you on your part should
                                clearly confirm at the U.N. as you did at your press conference and
                                in your messages to me the pledge of non-invasion of Cuba by the
                                United States and your allies having removed reservations which are
                                being introduced now into the U.S. draft declaration in the Security
                                Council and our representatives in New York should come to terms
                                with regard to an agreed wording in the declarations of both powers
                                of the commitments undertaken by them.”</p>
                            <p>… “I will tell you frankly that we have removed our means from Cuba
                                relying on your assurance that the United States and its allies will
                                not invade Cuba…. We hope and we would like to believe—I spoke of
                                that publicly too, as you know—that you will adhere to the
                                commitments which you have taken, as strictly as we do with regard
                                to our commitments. We, Mr. President, have already fulfilled our
                                commitments concerning the removal of our missiles and IL–28 planes
                                from Cuba and we did it even ahead of time. It is obvious that
                                fulfillment by you of your commitments cannot be as clearly
                                demonstrated as it was done by us since your commitments are of a
                                long-term nature. But it is important to fulfill them and to do
                                everything so that no doubts are sown from the very start that they
                                will not be fulfilled.”</p>
                            <p>“Therefore, Mr. President, everything—the stability in this area and
                                not only in this area but in the entire world—depends on how you
                                will now fulfill the commitments taken by you. Furthermore, it will
                                be <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0628"/>now a sort of litmus
                                paper, an indicator whether it is possible to trust if similar
                                difficulties arise in other geographical areas.”</p>
                            <p>“We believe that the guarantees for non-invasion of Cuba given by you
                                will be maintained and not only in the period of your stay in the
                                White House.”</p>
                            <p>… “But the confidential nature of our personal relations will depend
                                on whether you fulfill—as we did—the commitments taken by you and
                                give instructions to your representatives in New York to formalize
                                these commitments in appropriate documents… . it is necessary to fix
                                the assumed commitments in the documents of both sides and register
                                them with the United Nations.”</p>

                            <p>“You refer to the importance of my statements on an invasion of Cuba
                                and of our intention to fulfill them, so that no doubts are sown
                                from the very start…The other side of the coin, however, is that we
                                do need to have adequate assurances that all offensive weapons are
                                removed from Cuba and are not reintroduced, and that Cuba itself
                                commits no aggressive acts against any of the nations of the Western
                                Hemisphere. As I understand you, you feel confident that Cuba will
                                not in fact engage in such aggressive acts, and of course I already
                                have your own assurance about the offensive weapons. So I myself
                                should suppose that you could accept our position—but it is probably
                                better to leave final discussion of these matters to our
                                representatives in New York.”</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>I saw Vorontsov at the request of the President to give him the following
                            communication.</p>
                        <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0629"/>
                        <p>We have noticed with satisfaction the assurance of the Soviet Government
                            that the understandings of 1962 are still in full force. We take this to
                            mean that the Soviet Union will not emplace any offensive weapons of any
                            kind or any nuclear weapons on Cuban soil.</p>
                        <p>For our part, the President wishes to point out that although we have
                            heard repeated reports of increased Soviet activity in Cuba, he was
                            exercising the utmost restraint in not increasing reconnaissance
                            activities. He was maintaining the understandings of 1962 which I was
                            hereby authorized to reaffirm. Specifically, the United States would not
                            use military force to bring about a change in the governmental structure
                            of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I then said I wanted to add a personal observation to the formal
                            communication. It had come to our attention that Soviet long-range
                            airplanes of a type that were suitable to nuclear bombing missions were
                            flying with increasing regularity to Cuba. While we believed that these
                            planes were on reconnaissance missions, we thought, nevertheless, that
                            this might provide a basis for approaching the limit of our
                            understandings. It would certainly be noticed if the Soviet Union kept
                            such operations to an absolute minimum. The same went for Soviet fleet
                            activity in the Caribbean. I pointed out that these were not conditional
                            but rather atmospheric.</p>
                        <p>I then added that we were showing our good faith by having assigned two
                            Coast Guard cutters in recent days to shadow a Soviet ship which we
                            believed was in imminent danger of being attacked by some Cuban exile
                                groups.<note n="2" xml:id="d195fn2">See <ref target="#d193">Document

                        </p>
                        <p>Vorontsov said he appreciated the good spirit in which I had made these
                            observations and he was certain that the Kremlin would be very happy to
                            receive them. It was in sharp contrast, he added, to our last
                            conversation on April 30<note n="3" xml:id="d195fn3">The last

                                29; see <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>.</note> when he had
                            been in a position (correctly) to point out to me that a Soviet reaction
                            to our Cambodian venture would be extremely unfortunate. I told
                            Vorontsov that the major problem now was to see what concrete progress
                            could be made in the area of negotiations.</p>

                            wondered whether he knew him. I mentioned Mr.
                                <persName>Hament</persName>'s name and Mr.
                                <persName>Vorontsov</persName> said yes he had met him at some
                            social function at the Soviet Embassy. I then told him the substance of
                            Casey's memorandum and said that it was difficult to know how to
                            respond. If it was a serious communication, we would of course want to
                            make our comments. On the other hand, if it was a general communication
                            which Hament overplayed then we could drop it. The major point was that
                            if it was a serious communication there was some time problem and we
                            could therefore not play it the usual way.</p>
                        <p>I said that I understood that Vorontsov himself had attended the
                            meetings. Vorontsov said this could not be true since on July 28 he was
                            not in the Embassy. He said that he had only come back from the Soviet
                            Union on July 29 and had only seen <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> at the airport for <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598"
                                facs="0631"/>a farewell exchange of views. He said that it sounded
                            to him as if this was not a serious communication but that Hament had
                            played up a general expression of interest into a very specific
                            proposal. However, he would check it and let me know.</p>
                        <p>I then told Vorontsov that regardless of whether this particular thing
                            was a serious communication, I wanted to use this occasion to discuss
                            the general subject of a higher level meeting. Vorontsov said that he
                            was, of course, familiar with the subject having read the record of my
                            previous conversations with <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName>. (Note: <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> had told me that Vorontsov was the only person
                            in the Embassy who was informed of them. This was done in order to
                            prevent a situation from developing while <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> was out of town and no one present at the
                            Soviet Embassy would have any information.)</p>
                        <p>Vorontsov said he knew for a fact that the subject was under very active
                            discussion in Moscow at the moment. Indeed, one of the reasons for
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s return to the
                            Soviet Union was so that he could participate in these high level
                            meetings with the top leadership. They were probably now at the Crimea
                            for a leisurely discussion and we would no doubt receive an official
                            reply.</p>
                        <p>I said the difficulty was that we had to make our plans for the fall and
                            winter and that we had kept a number of them in abeyance in order to be
                            able to respond to the possibilities. For example, we had been told that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would come to the
                            United Nations General Assembly but we had never had any official word.
                            Vorontsov said that he did not have any word on this either, and he
                            doubted that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> knew.</p>
                        <p>I said, of course, that we had discussed various levels for meetings and
                            various possible occasions but that the matter was in abeyance until we
                            got some further word. I told Vorontsov that it would be highly
                            desirable for us to have some preliminary indication fairly soon.
                            Vorontsov said he would get word to us. He said he certainly felt that
                            his leadership believed now that there were many advantages in high
                            level meetings as was proved by the recent high level visitors to
                            Moscow, particularly <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>.</p>
                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries the meeting ended.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Soviet Minister Vorontsov came in today to give us an answer to our query
                            about their interest in a summit meeting, prompted by recent Soviet
                            approaches to Mr. <persName>Harvey Hament</persName>.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d197fn2">See <ref target="#d196fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    196</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Vorontsov handed me a rather vague note, attached at Tab A, which
                            indicates that Moscow has decided to play the subject of a possible
                            summit meeting coolly, at least for the time being. The note states that
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> brought to the
                            attention of the Soviet leadership your idea of a summit meeting, and
                            declares the Soviets' “positive approach” to a summit, “provided that
                            such meetings are duly prepared allowing thus to count on getting
                            results.” It then invites your concrete suggestions about moving toward
                            a summit, saying that Moscow will be ready to study them
                            attentively.</p>
                        <p>In our brief conversation Vorontsov said that Mr.
                                <persName>Hament</persName> had exaggerated the importance of his
                            conversations with Soviet officials and that these encounters were not
                            serious. He denied that a large meeting had taken place as described by
                            Hament.</p>
                        <p>Our response to the Soviets, I believe, should be played coolly like
                            their note itself. I propose that I go back to Vorontsov and merely tell
                            him that we are prepared to move toward a summit meeting within the
                            framework that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> and I have been discussing, recalling that we
                            had set a tentative agenda featuring European security, <gloss
                                target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss>, and the Middle East. I would add
                            that the next step will have to be to set a date and that November or
                            December are impossible.</p>

                            <p>The Soviet Ambassador has brought to the knowledge of the Soviet
                                leadership the idea of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                    >Nixon</persName>, which was forwarded through Dr. <persName

                                Soviet-American meeting on the highest level.</p>
                            <p>The American side is aware of our positive approach to the contacts
                                on the highest level, including the form of personal meetings of the
                                leaders of the two powers—the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                and the US, provided that such meetings are duly prepared allowing
                                thus to count on getting results.</p>
                            <p>With such an understanding of this question Moscow will be ready to
                                study attentively concrete suggestions which President <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Vorontsov</persName> read the communication carefully. He
                            then stated to General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> that
                            he understood it completely. General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1"
                                >Haig</persName> then stated to him that he, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName>, had also been instructed to
                            deliver the following oral message from Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>: The U.S. Government believes that pending
                            progress between Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            and the Soviet Ambassador on the agenda items contained in the U.S.
                            communication that it might be of value to fix a date for a meeting
                            between President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and
                            Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> or General
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, or both, on
                            the occasion of the Anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly
                            during the week of October 18 in New York. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> reiterated that the months of
                            November and December would pose insurmountable problems for the U.S.
                            side for such a meeting since the President would be involved in a heavy
                            work schedule associated with the preparation of the President's Annual
                            Message to the Congress. Finally, General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1"
                                >Haig</persName> stated that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> would be most grateful for an early response
                            from the Soviet side as to the feasibility and timing of the suggested
                            venue. Mr. <persName>Vorontsov</persName> stated that he would be in
                            immediate touch with Moscow and anticipated an early response.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned at 10:07 a.m.</p>

                        <p>As we await Soviet reaction to our latest exchange, I thought you might
                            want to have some reflections on the subject of summits. This memorandum
                            discusses the background of U.S.-Soviet summits; <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s role in the Soviet leadership
                            and his personal traits; and the role a trip of his would play in
                            current Soviet policy generally.</p>
                        <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0636"/>
                        <p>Over the years, summit meetings with American Presidents have held as
                            much, albeit rather different, fascination for Soviet leaders as vice
                            versa. It has always been one of the paradoxes of Bolshevik behavior
                            that their leaders have yearned to be treated as equals by the people
                            they consider doomed. For Khrushchev, consorting with the high and
                            mighty of the capitalist world roused some of the impulses of the
                            parvenue. But the totality factors that have gone into Soviet thinking
                            and feeling (as into American) have been complex and ambivalent and defy
                            precise definition.</p>
                        <p>Certainly, in the last 15 years or so—since the Geneva summit—there has
                            been the element of coresponsibility for the survival of mankind that is
                            so uniquely part of the American-Soviet relationship by virtue of our
                            size and power. In many ways, the psychological adjustment to this
                            special relationship has been harder for the Soviets who were raised in
                            a value system of victors and vanquished, of historically-ordained and
                            objectively determined class hostility which temporary, subjective
                            factors could not really change.</p>
                        <p>In any event, there is now a history of Soviet leadership interest in
                            communication with American Presidents; and the same impulse, whatever
                            its wellsprings, has existed among American Presidents since Roosevelt.
                            This has been true despite the fact that summits, since World War II,
                            have produced few if any specific results, except procedural ones: i.e.,
                            agreements to have more meetings, at lower levels. It might be argued
                            that the 1959 Eisenhower–Khrushchev summit, by producing agreement on a
                            four-power summit six months hence gave Berlin that much of a lease on
                            life. But in the end that four-power summit, in 1960, aborted and Berlin
                            lived on, anyway.</p>
                        <p>Many hold the view that a summit is useful for atmospheric reasons, to
                            make it easier for countries to reach subsequent understandings; from
                            this perspective, agreement all too often becomes an end in itself.
                            However unimportant or irrelevant the settlement may be, it is said to
                            contribute to a climate of confidence which will “improve” the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The usual consequence of such an approach is that more ingenuity and
                            effort are put into finding things to agree on than in coming to grips
                            with the issues that have caused the tensions. As a result the
                            difficulties which are “ironed out” are often soluble only because they
                            are inconsequential. This distortion is forgotten and the mere fact that
                            something is settled, no matter how trivial, is said to be “progress.”
                            Such agreements, therefore, become a means of postponing instead of
                            solving the real issues. They do not lessen the tensions but rather
                            perpetuate them.</p>
                        <p>The topics which were slated for discussion at the Paris summit
                            conference in 1960 are evidence of this point: exchange of persons,
                            nuclear testing, arms control, and Berlin. They are either so
                            unimportant <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0637"/>that they can be
                            solved fairly easily and without the attention of heads of state, or
                            they are so complicated that a summit conference can at best serve as a
                            means for deferring decision.</p>
                        <p>The intangible results of meetings between American and Soviet leaders
                            are harder to define and more controversial; many observers think that
                            these results far outweigh the absence of concrete ones: e.g., the
                            supposedly tacit agreement in 1955 that nuclear war was unthinkable; or
                            the impact on Sino-Soviet relations of the mere fact of the Camp David
                            meeting in 1959; or the ultimate effect on Soviet strategic doctrine and
                            on their view of the <gloss target="#t_ABM1">ABM</gloss> of McNamara's
                            Glassboro lectures to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> in
                            1967. These things are hard to judge; but that American-Soviet summits
                            involve or produce some special chemical mixtures that American-Mexican
                            ones don't is undoubtedly true. The only question is whether the mixture
                            is for good or ill.</p>
                        <p>Nor have domestic political considerations always been absent—on either
                            side. Khrushchev saw his cavortings with the Capitalist great as
                            enhancing his stature at home. In <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName>'s case, foreign trips and summit meetings are
                            not so much part of a personal “election campaign” (although, in fact,
                            the current pre-Party Congress period is something not unlike an
                            American election campaign). Rather, as the representative of the aging
                            Soviet Troika, a <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> trip to
                            New York and meeting with the American President—especially if they
                            could be depicted as successful—would be used on arguments against Young
                            Turk elements in the Party who are critical of the moribund approaches
                            of the now top ruling group which has now been at the top for six years.
                            Arguments like “we know how to handle the American ruling group”
                            undoubtedly figure in internal debates.</p>
                        <p>It may be that in this particular year a <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> foray into the West is connected with a general
                            Soviet effort to delineate certain more orderly relations with the West.
                            This could be because of the uncertainties of the Chinese challenge, the
                            instabilities in Eastern Europe which the Czech invasion submerged but
                            did not remove and the need for greater certainty in economic planning
                            at a time when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> faces tough and
                            expensive economic and technological choices.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps we need not take quite so epochal a view of a possible <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> meeting. After all, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the Soviet summit.
                            (In fact, one of President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName>'s unending frustrations was that he could never
                            quite find his Soviet equivalent: sometimes it was <persName

                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> and sometimes—usually only for
                            purposes of writing messages beginning with “Your Excellency”—it was
                                <persName corresp="#p_PNV1">Podgorny</persName>.) <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> quite evidently is number 2 in
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in many important ways; yet
                            some would argue that someone like Kirilenko, who might some day be
                            General Secretary, is more like the real number 2 than <persName

                                >Kosygin</persName> has never challenged <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> for the top spot, <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605"
                                facs="0638"/>though we know that he has sometimes done things in
                            ways that made <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> feel he
                            was showing insufficient deference to number 1. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> obviously is a manager who
                            likes to manage, sometimes he cuts corners, even around the Party. (Yet,
                            as a Marxist, on many issues we know him to be almost a Puritan.)</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> comes to New York, it
                            will not be because he decided to come but because the Collective,
                            whatever precisely that is, decided he should go. He may or may not have
                            plenipotentiary power on some issue or other. In 1967, we know he
                            frequently checked with the home office for instructions; though in
                            London in 1966, our intelligence caught him slipping a couple of things
                            past the lethargic <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in
                            the interest of speed. (Speed, cutting corners, getting things done,
                            indeed, is where <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s main
                            troubles with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> have been.
                            His strength has been that he has not reached for the top job and, in
                            fact, does not have the constituency in the Party for doing so.)</p>
                        <p>An intriguing question, if <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            comes toward the end of October is whether by that time November 2 will
                            be so close that he would be able to give President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> the Soviet counterproposal on
                                <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> (assuming the Soviet
                            leadership can agree on one). Then again, if Bahr's analysis of Soviet
                            interests has any merit, would <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> come in October to offer some interesting
                            proposition on Berlin? <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> (including
                            the fascinating and ramified third country problem) and Berlin are the
                            two issues on which Soviets could make really interesting offers on
                            their own initiative. On the Middle East, they are not free agents.
                            However, even if <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> made
                            such moves, it is unlikely that he would be here long enough or that his
                            terms would be so close to ours that anything remotely close to
                            conclusive negotiations could be expected.</p>
                        <p>As in the past, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would come
                            not only in the expectation of seeing our President. The Soviets have in
                            recent years acquired a certain interest in the UN and in the potential
                            it provides for a Soviet role as the defender of small, formerly
                            colonial countries. Depending on where the Middle East situation stood,
                            the Soviets could also, under his leadership, seek to start an
                            anti-Israel/US bandwagon as they abortively tried in 1967. They could
                            try a push for admission of divided countries, with Germany in the
                            vanguard. In sum, the strand in Soviet policy that gropes for
                            co-responsibility, condominium, duopoly with the US remains vigorously
                            accompanied by other strands more directly and more obviously
                            prejudicial to our interests. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> would be here to exemplify this multiplicity of
                            tendencies. (The more hopeful strand, incidentally, would continue
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> came or not,
                            though it might perhaps be set back a little if the Soviets felt they
                            had been deliberately snubbed or insulted.)</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has on occasion in the
                            past demonstrated keen negotiating skill. Even if undoubtedly acting on
                            Politburo orders, and closely <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0639"
                            />flanked by the diplomatic and military expertise of Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and Defensive
                            Minister Grechko, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
                            deserves much credit personally for bringing off the Tashkent-compromise
                            between India and Pakistan. (It should be added that the establishment
                            of peace, or at least the prevention of war on the Subcontinent was
                            genuinely in the Soviet national interest—as it was in ours—since war
                            might have faced the Soviets with the dilemma of openly supporting India
                            against a China-supported Pakistan.)</p>
                        <p>The sudden fatal heart attack of Indian Prime Minister Shastri at
                            Tashkent has never been traced, by any one, to the effect of his
                            personal encounters with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.
                            Indeed none has ever attributed to the Soviet Premier the capacity for
                            personal brutality and crudeness that, according to the most reliable
                            reports, were displayed by <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>, for example, just two years ago when the
                            kidnapped, Liberal Czechoslovak leaders were Kremlin “guests.”</p>
                        <p>We know that <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> is tough and
                            unyielding, if need be. We know, too that while foreign policy is not
                            his first love, he briefs himself meticulously and masters the subject
                            matter at hand and the Soviet position on it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has sometimes been
                            identified with the “liberal” wing of the Soviet leadership, mostly
                            because of his interest in economic advancement and efficient
                            management. His son-in-law, Gvishiani has been responsible for
                            expediting certain kinds of technical US-Soviet exchanges. Yet none
                            could, like <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>, survive near
                            the very top of Soviet leadership for over thirty years without at least
                            having acquiesced in the brutalities of the regime. His origins are in
                            the Leningrad Party organization which was almost completely purged by
                            Stalin. Like the rest of the sixty-odd year-olds in the Politburo,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has had to walk over
                            corpses to be where he is.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has also showed
                            considerable shrewdness in dealing with Americans, even if, as one must
                            assume, his general conduct was on orders from the Politburo. There have
                            been several instances when he has impressed Americans, and others, as
                            the equivalent of the manager of a large Western corporation. But in
                            1965—to cite just one example—he displayed unusual psychological
                            adroitness when dealing with Averell Harriman. On the first day of the
                            Governor's visit, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> was
                            tough, dour and almost brutal in depicting the deleterious effects of
                            the American aggression against the DRV. The Americans were depressed
                            and their telegrams showed it. On the second day, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> painted vistas of US-Soviet
                            cooperation once we had only screwed up enough courage to get out of
                            Vietnam. He reminded Harriman how he had successfully negotiated the
                            test ban treaty and subtly suggested that there might well be other
                            treaties (at that time the <gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> was the
                            great US dream) that the Governor might bring to fruition. <pb n="607"

                            judgments, the Governor's firm conviction that somehow, sometime the

                            second day's encounter in 1965.</p>

                                    <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> summarizing the
                                    <gloss target="#t_PFIAB1">PFIAB</gloss> meetings of August
                                6–7.</note> is a followup of the FIAB's concern on the Sino-Soviet
                            issue registered to you at last month's luncheon. While it goes somewhat
                            beyond the pale of their areas of responsibility, I do think that we
                            should handle it seriously, given the responsible attitude of the FIAB.
                            I do not think the draft reply prepared by <persName corresp="#p_HWG1"
                                >Hyland</persName>
                            <note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">Attached but not printed.</note> fits the
                            bill in any sense in that it passes the buck back to Burke to deal with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> on something that the
                            FIAB has quite rightly brought to your attention as a followup of their
                            luncheon meeting with you.</p>
                        <p>I am also not so sure that an <gloss target="#t_NIE1">NIE</gloss> of the

                            <p>In its early August meeting <gloss target="#t_PFIAB1">PFIAB</gloss>
                                considered the problem of current intelligence estimates of possible
                                developments in the Sino-Soviet confrontation (Tab B). They
                                apparently conclude that, as a “matter of high priority,” a national
                                intelligence estimate should be prepared on the timing, nature,
                                scope, duration and probable outcome of military operations that
                                might be initiated by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                                against China. Second, they recommend a similar estimate on
                                implications as to the effect on US interests of such hostilities.
                                Finally, they suggest a study of courses of action available to the
                                US (1) to avoid becoming involved, and (2) to improve US relative
                                positions vis-à-vis the two contestants in areas of US
                                interests.</p>

                                that we will produce a better paper than the one shepherded by Roger

                                community want to perform a service, they might consider a different
                                aspect entirely. No amount of intelligence guessing on a Sino-Soviet
                                war is of any value unless hostilities seem imminent; when they did
                                last year, the most we got was a waffle. Intelligence might perform
                                a service, however, by considering what factors might lead to a
                                Sino-Soviet accommodation. This is usually ignored, but would be as
                                important for our interests as a war. Moreover, we in the West have
                                comfortably come to regard Sino-Soviet hostility as a permanent
                                feature of the landscape, much as we did monolithic communism. Yet
                                many Sinologists believe much of the hostility is due to Mao and
                                Maoism. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the early phase of the
                                cultural revolution was sparked by a dispute over relations with the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—with an important part of
                                the Chinese establishment, including some of the military, disposed
                                to patch up the dispute. The Soviet-German treaty ought to be a
                                reminder that patterns of international politics can shift
                                rapidly.</p>

                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> along with UAR would bear
                                responsibility for possible resumption of fighting. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> could never accept such an
                                accusation. The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was not
                                engaged in hostilities in <gloss target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss>, and
                                therefore could not be held responsible for things with which it is
                                not connected.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Second, he said he could see very clearly our idea was to cover up
                                for recent Israeli actions. The well-known facts were that Israel
                                had disrupted the NY talks. It was unwilling to accept resumption of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> mission, had done
                                so only in “funny way,” and then Tekoah ran off to Israel and is
                                still there. The Arabs are still in NY. Why then blame <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>/UAR for disrupting the
                                talks?</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Third, the US was accusing the UAR of a “kind of violation” of
                                ceasefire agreement. However, one does not know if there were
                                violations. For its part, the UAR accuses Israel of violating the
                                agreement. Since US planes are flying over Eastern side of Suez
                                Canal and can see over both sides, <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> should be able to determine accuracy of UAR
                                charges. Therefore, my statement looked “strange.”</item>

                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>I told <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> that,
                                while we were taking up matter with UAR, we regarded the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as involved since Soviet weapons
                                and personnel were there and that their people on the ground must
                                have knowledge of developments which were contrary to the ceasefire
                                agreement. He asserted that any talk of ceasefire violations should
                                be established by “both sides.” In proposing the ceasefire
                                agreement, the US said that verification of observance should be
                                done by national means. The US may be right in charging that
                                violations have occurred, but neither “you nor we,” he asserted,
                                know whether they have actually taken place. We both know clearly
                                only that Israel has raised a hue and cry about violations.</item>

                            <item>He then said “there were no Soviet weapons in the UAR,” although
                                the UAR had bought Soviet weapons. There were no Soviet troops
                                there; only advisers and technicians. Therefore, the situation was
                                different than represented, and he said the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> was in no way involved in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ME1">ME</gloss> crisis. I told <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> my government would take
                                note of his statement, and added that it was our belief that Soviet
                                personnel were involved with complicated weapons in the UAR.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item>I stressed our concern over the situation, noting that we had
                                approached the GUAR regarding the violations I was speaking to him
                                about. I said both the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and the
                                GOI were convinced that ceasefire violations had taken place, and
                                handed him list of coordinates contained in paras 16–18 of Reftel.
                                These violations were reason, I said, why the Israelis were staying
                                away from NY. Although we were pressing them to return to NY to
                                resume the talks, the GOI was confronted with a serious domestic
                                situation as a result of the violations. This simply was a factor
                                which we should both realize. In response to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName>'s question, I said we
                                had raised with the GOI Egyptian charges of Israeli violations and
                                were pressing Tel Aviv for more precise information.</item>
                            <label>9.</label>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> then returned to
                                his assertion that we were trying to put the blame on the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> rather than where it belonged. I
                                responded that we shared a joint responsibility. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was convinced that the ceasefire
                                has been violated, and that the situation is extremely serious. The
                                ceasefire and talks may be in jeopardy. Therefore, both of us should
                                approach the situation in the spirit of taking steps to maintain the
                                ceasefire.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> then said that our
                                accusations were wrong. He could see, he asserted, that the US
                                wished to prepare the ground for the disruption of the talks and the
                                resumption of hostilities. I immediately interrupted, saying this
                                was not true. There was not the slightest such intention on our
                                part, and I repudiated his suggestion. The situation was serious.
                                The UAR had violated the ceasefire. We should both be concerned
                                about such a development inasmuch as it could lead to a breakdown in
                                the talks.</item>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> then backed off
                                somewhat, especially when I asked him whether the Soviet Government
                                should not be concerned, assuming our charges were true. He replied
                                the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> did not want the talks to
                                break down. He said Moscow had supported the US initiative, whereas
                                Israel had been reluctant to do so. Now Israel was accusing Cairo of
                                violating the ceasefire as a pretext for trying to disrupt the
                                talks. The situation, according to <persName corresp="#p_VVM2"
                                    >Vinogradov</persName>, was serious because of all the
                                “shouting” Israel was doing; if the talks were resumed the situation
                                would not be serious.</item>
                            <label>12.</label>
                            <item>He then asked if I did not think that the ceasefire agreement
                                provided for maintenance and the repair and restoration of
                                facilities, to which I replied that our information clearly
                                indicated that the violations I was talking about went far beyond
                                repair and restoration.</item>
                            <label>13.</label>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> then charged that
                                we were making our accusations and drawing conclusions before
                                waiting for the results of our approach to Cairo. He wondered how we
                                could put ourselves in the role of being the only judge in such a
                                complicated situation and why we wished to take on such a
                                role.</item>
                            <label>14.</label>
                            <item>I reiterated that, because of the seriousness of the situation, we
                                were approaching both the UAR and Moscow. I then said that, as a
                                personal suggestion, it seemed to me that if something could be
                                done, quietly and without publicity, it might improve the situation.
                                If the UAR would withdraw some—maybe not all—of its missiles as a
                                gesture, this would be a small step toward restoring confidence and
                                returning Israel to the conference table.</item>

                            <item>The discussion then turned to Jordan, with <persName

                                information indicated the situation was “no worse—no better.” It was
                                his assessment, <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName>
                                said, that it would not be useful for Iraq to do something
                                “serious.” He did not, however, know how Jordan had behaved. The
                                Soviet concern, he asserted, was to have good conditions for the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> mission. I closed
                                by stating both our governments were faced by a situation of extreme
                                seriousness.</item>

                                September 6, bombings of a number of regions of the UAR in the zone
                                of the Suez Canal beyond the ceasefire line. Thus, the Israeli
                                ruling circles, encouraged by the constant declarations from
                                Washington about an increase in military deliveries to Israel, in
                                addition to the sabotage they are conducting of the talks in New
                                York, are now preparing to set out on a course of direct military
                                provocations against the UAR with the aim of disrupting the efforts
                                toward a peaceful settlement of the middle-east conflict.</item>

                            that the Government of USA will undertake the steps to prevent Israel
                            from taking the steps they are planning. Our man in Moscow believes we
                            should come back urgently with action he recommends.</p>

                            and think it affords us an opportunity to do the following. Vorontsov
                            just asked to see me urgently and he is meeting with me at 2:30 pm
                            today. At the meeting I will just say thank you very much and receive
                            the message. I will take two steps. We ought to tell the Israelis that
                            this note has been received and, of course, we wish to repeat to them
                            what we really said the other day that we assume that there is not going
                            to be any unilateral action on their part and how serious this would be.
                            The second phase would be to go back to the Russians and say we have
                            taken action in this regard but we want to say to you that you have a
                            responsibility and we have then put them in a position of getting these
                            things out of here and then to conclude by saying once these missiles
                            have been removed, you, the Russians will no longer have any worry about
                            this. I would like to proceed this way. This raises the question of the
                            letter you have.</p>

                            not give color to the fact that we have taken appropriate measures. That
                            gives them a shot at the Arabs. All we need to do is tell Rabin that we
                            have had this communication and I would not make any new views. I would
                            not go back <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0650"/>to the Russians
                            today and then today I would go back with essentially what you have done

                            offers nothing concrete that would indicate that the Soviets or UAR
                            intend to restrain their missile build-up, let alone tear it down. <hi
                                rend="italic">Yet</hi>, both the tone of the oral statement and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName>'s comments suggest
                            that the Soviets may have blinked, if only slightly.</p>
                        <p>There is very little truculence in the formal statement and, rather
                            plaintively, <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> asked
                            “rhetorically,” how could rectification be accomplished? This last
                            question is perhaps the operative part of the Soviet presentation, and
                            may be the diplomatic opening that we need, especially if coupled with
                            that part of the formal statement—which <persName corresp="#p_VVM2"
                                >Vinogradov</persName> called attention to—that offered bilateral
                            talks or a multilateral effort to move toward a settlement.</p>
                        <p>This could be pure evasion, particularly in light of the continuing
                            missile build-up and direct Soviet involvement in it. (This last aspect
                            incidentally seems to be getting lost in the shuffle. We will ultimately
                            have to face up to the question of how to deal with the issue of Soviet
                            presence.) On the other hand, having sliced several large chunks off the
                            salami both the Soviets and the UAR may feel that they can resume <pb
                                n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0651"/>political maneuvering to bring
                            the Israelis back to the conference table, or at least to retrieve what
                            they may have lost politically by the violation through isolating Israel
                            (and us) as the opponents of talks.</p>
                        <p>The fact that <persName corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> displayed
                            responsiveness to the concept of “rectification,” even if rhetorically,
                            could be a key opportunity. <persName corresp="#p_RBH1">Read</persName>
                            one way, this could be a cautious invitation for us to respond and could
                            be a signal that the Soviets do not reject the idea privately broached
                            by <persName corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName> to <persName
                                corresp="#p_VVM2">Vinogradov</persName> on September 3,<note n="3"

                            that removal of some missiles would be a necessary sign of good faith.
                            Under this interruption, the Soviets could be inviting us to follow up
                            and give them our ideas of what would constitute rectification, but in
                            the secrecy of bilateral channels.</p>
                        <p>If so, it would be a great mistake to become involved in the morass of
                            detailed numbers games over this or that missile site, or as currently
                            proposed by <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, to put to the
                            Soviets a list of actions they should take.</p>
                        <p>What we need is a concept that matches our general position that neither
                            side should gain a military advantage and that a balance should be
                            maintained. Under this approach what we should concentrate on is the <hi
                                rend="italic">number of operational missile sites</hi> as of August
                            10 and tell the Soviets that what we expect is that they will, in
                            whatever manner they choose, restore this situation. If the Soviets do
                            not accept our estimate of number of operational missile sites and claim
                            there were less, so much the better. If they claim there were more,
                            within limits we could go along and say this becomes the new ceiling.
                            This approach focuses on the critical military item (missile launchers)
                            and avoids the ambiguity of “related” equipment, occupied vs unoccupied,
                            mobile vs stationary, SA–2 vs SA–3.</p>
                        <p>This approach could be linked to the other <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> idea of cancelling out violations in return for
                            dropping further investigation of Israeli violations.</p>
                        <p>In any case, it is worth exploring whether <persName corresp="#p_VVM2"
                                >Vinogradov</persName> has in fact given a signal, or is merely
                            throwing sand in our eyes. It does not appear to warrant, however, the
                            proposed <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> approach of
                            elevating the rhetoric but rather a fast, but quiet <persName
                                corresp="#p_BJD1">Beam</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_VVM2"
                                >Vinogradov</persName> negotiations. That this had already started
                            would, presumably, have some effect on the meetings with Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG7">Meir</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHHH1">Hal Saunders</persName> points out that it
                            is difficult from intelligence to determine the number of operational
                            sites. Using “occupied” sites might bring us close enough to the general
                            concept to establish a reasonable <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619"
                                facs="0652"/>base. The intelligence people would have to go back
                            over the photos and do a best guess list of occupied sites which
                            represent military capability. He feels that this approach might be a
                            better one than the more elaborate <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                >Sisco</persName> proposals now that there may be some opening to
                            explore, but wonders whether the Soviets are really prepared to make
                            that kind of concession given the fact that they and the Egyptians have
                            not even broken stride in their build-up since our approach of September
                            3.</p>
                        <p>I do not know of course whether, in fact, the Soviets will make any
                            concessions. The point is that we probably should exhaust this
                            possibility, particularly in view of what may have been some very mixed
                            signals to the Soviets during August. If it proves fruitless, we will
                            have to haul out the heavy artillery.</p>

                                as a Source of Crises in US-Soviet Relations</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I should like very briefly to convey to you my deep concern that in the
                            present Middle Eastern situation we may have (unwittingly) misled the
                            Soviets to believe that cheating on the cease-fire was a matter of
                            indifference to us and that we may have thereby contributed to a
                            potentially much deeper crisis.</p>
                        <p>Interpretation of Soviet conduct is a tricky and quite inexact exercise
                            and I am very conscious of all the pitfalls and evidential gaps and
                            ambiguities in this sort of analysis. I also do not claim to know or to
                            have followed in detail all that we may have said and done with respect
                            to the present state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>I am disturbed by the present train of events because of a history of
                            US-Soviet crisis situations which lends itself to the respectable <pb
                                n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0653"/>hypothesis that, especially in
                            election years, we may be prone to give the Soviets the impression that
                            they are relatively free to do certain things inimical to our interests;
                            that they then do them; that we then react and find ourselves propelled
                            into potentially dangerous and damaging confrontations. Some work has
                            been done on this hypothesis as it relates to Suez (1956), various
                            phases of the Berlin crisis, and, most especially, the Cuban missile
                            crisis (1962). I have not done the research myself, do not have the
                            required mass of findings or data available and would question some of
                            the conclusions that have been advanced.</p>

                                <item>—that what was said (especially, at that time, by a phalanx of

                                    summer could well have appeared to the Soviets as US
                                    acquiescence in what they were doing, including in the Soviet
                                    depiction of it as solely “defensive”;</item>

                                    remain passive and that, indeed, it was politically more
                                    important to us that nothing leaked out before November than
                                    that the Soviets would acquire some 40-odd additional

                                    were well underway (plus further ongoing negotiations, e.g. on

                        <p>I am drawing no <hi rend="italic">precise</hi> analogies. One can't. I do
                            suggest, however, that the nature, timing and speed of our cease-fire
                            initiative, the relative looseness of its terms, the informality of its
                            consummation, our reluctance to concede violations and our other
                            statements and actions <hi rend="italic">after</hi> violations began
                            could have led the Soviets to conclude that all that really mattered to
                            us was a cease-fire in a pre-election period in which we preferred not
                            to confront the awkward choices of continued open warfare. They could,
                            therefore, have concluded that what they know are violations certainly
                            of the spirit and also of the terms of the <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621"
                                facs="0654"/>agreement were not of vital interest to us. They could
                            thus have been surprised by our subsequent apparently real indignation
                            at what was happening (having meanwhile given the UAR, and themselves,
                            the green light to proceed with violations and thus put their prestige
                            on the line). Or they may even yet believe that we are merely
                            play-acting.</p>
                        <p>I have sent you another memo, on the latest <persName corresp="#p_BJD1"

                            possibly now be sufficiently worried about our further reaction that
                            they are willing to consider some form of “rectification”; or that at
                            least they are trying to maneuver politically to inhibit us from acting.
                            On the other hand, this is far from clear. And there is no telling what
                            may happen to the cease-fire and what the Soviets may do in the face of
                            some unilateral Israeli act of “rectification” (or some new US act of
                            support for Israel) when they may well have thought of themselves (and
                            their clients) as acting on the Suez west bank with our toleration.
                            (Even more than in Cuba, the Soviets this time <hi rend="italic"
                                >knew</hi> for certain that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> knew the
                            standstill was being violated.)</p>
                        <p>I do not claim to know the right way to communicate our intentions and
                            conceptions of interests (assuming we ourselves know and agree what they
                            are) to the Soviets in a way that minimizes the danger of
                            misconstruction and subsequent deep confrontation. Nor, emphatically, do
                            I exonerate the Soviets, who after all are the perpetrators of or
                            accessories to the inimical acts in question.</p>
                        <p>I merely note from past involvement in these matters that our propensity
                            to give the wrong signal has been considerable and that a theory is
                            intellectually quite tenable that holds that some major US-Soviet crises
                            of the past, especially in months before US elections, can be correlated
                            to what we ourselves say and do, including at highest (presumed or
                            actual) levels. Admitting that I have not been very close to Middle
                            Eastern developments and to our explicit and implicit communications to
                            the Soviets about them, I nevertheless wish to register my deep concern
                            that this theory has acquired additional weight by recent events.</p>

                                <item>—Expressed Soviet anxiety over alleged attempts by Cuban
                                    revolutionary groups in the United States to resume sabotage and
                                    subversive activity against Cuba from the U.S. soil.</item>
                                <item>—Complained about provocative articles in the American press
                                    and ambivalent statements on the part of the U.S. officials

                                <item>—Stressed that the Soviets were proceeding on the Cuban
                                    question from the understanding with regard to Cuba that existed
                                    in the past and confirmed that the Soviets expected us to adhere
                                    to this understanding.</item>

                            Vorontsov was apparently referring was arrived at during the Cuban
                            missile crisis. In essence, during the exchanges between the U.S. and
                            the Soviets in 1962 at the time of the Cuban missile crisis we were
                            given assurances that the Soviets would not locate nuclear weapons on
                            Cuban territory in return for assurances from the U.S. government that
                            we would not undertake military action to change the government of
                            Cuba.</p>

                            had been instructed to give him the following reply: <list>

                                    weapons of any kind or any nuclear weapons on Cuban
                                    soil.”</item>
                                <item>—I stated further that you wish to point out that although we
                                    have heard repeated reports of increased Soviet activity in Cuba
                                    that you were exercising the utmost restraint in not increasing
                                    reconnaissance activity.</item>
                                <item>—You were maintaining the understandings of 1962 which I was
                                    hereby authorized to reaffirm.</item>
                                <item>—Specifically the U.S. would not use military force to bring
                                    about a change in the governmental structure of Cuba.</item>
                                <item>—I then added that it had come to our attention that Soviet
                                    long range airplanes of the type suitable for nuclear bombing
                                    missions were flying with increasing regularity to Cuba. While
                                    we believe these planes were on reconnaissance missions we
                                    thought nevertheless that this might constitute a basis for
                                    approaching the limit of our understanding. It would certainly
                                    be noticed if the Soviet Union kept such operations to a
                                    minimum. <hi rend="italic">The same applied to Soviet naval
                                        activity in the Caribbean</hi>.</item>
                                <item>—I called Vorontsov's attention to the fact that we had taken
                                    protective measures in recent days with respect to a Soviet ship
                                    which reportedly was in danger of attack from Cuban exile
                                    groups.</item>
                                <item>—Vorontsov indicated he appreciated the good spirit in which
                                    the observations were made and was certain that the Kremlin
                                    would be very happy to receive them.</item>
                                <item>—I concluded by telling Vorontsov that the major problem now
                                    was to see what concrete progress could be made in the area of
                                    negotiations.</item>

                        <p>Today's photography readout confirms that despite the exchange between
                            Vorontsov and myself the Soviets have moved precipitously to establish
                            an installation in Cien Fuegos Bay which is probably designed to serve
                            as a submarine staging base in the Caribbean. Because <pb n="624"

                                    target="#d207">Document 207</ref>.</note> circulated
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>In response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                            question as to military significance, <persName corresp="#p_MTH1"
                                >Moorer</persName> said that there was no question but that the
                            Soviets were building an advance submarine base. This kind of
                            installation would enable the Soviets either to have submarines come
                            into the port or have the tender rendezvous anywhere in international
                            waters. It greatly increases the on-station time of the subs.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that there
                            was some evidence this is also an R&amp;R area. Thus he assumed they
                            could fly in reserve crews and rotate crews via the tender. All the
                            servicing of the subs could take place in international waters; in
                            short, it was possible for the Soviets to operate in a “legal” way that
                            would make it very difficult for us to meet.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> suggested, however,
                            that this might be a violation of the 1962 <persName corresp="#p_KRT1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> pointed out that
                            strictly speaking there was never an “agreement” in 1962. There was an
                            exchange of letters some of which crossed each other. In essence, the
                            discussion then concentrated on UN inspection. The only thing we
                            focussed on were land-based missiles and IL 28's. There was really
                            nothing else, and no “agreement” in the conventional sense.</p>
                        <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0659"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> agreed with this
                            interpretation based on his review of the record and talks with McCloy
                            and McNamara.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> pointed out that
                            what the Russians did in 1962 was “legal.” What President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> did was to react on the basis
                            of a challenge to our security. There were two questions—Do the Russians
                            violate an international understanding with this activity? Probably not.
                            Secondly, what do we do from the security aspect?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> cited President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>'s press conference of
                            November 20, 1962, in which the President said that peace in the
                            Caribbean would depend upon strategic weapons being removed from Cuba
                            and “kept out in the future” under adequate measures of inspection. This
                            was the only specific thing we had, although everyone agreed that this
                            was only a unilateral declaration of our own position. (A copy of the
                            text of the November statement was given to Dr. <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> asked if there was any
                            evidence as to whether the base accommodated Y-Class subs or attack subs
                            or both.</p>
                        <p>It was generally agreed it could accommodate both.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> pointed out that the base
                            extends the operation of either Y or E class subs. The Soviets can now
                            do with 1 what it now takes 5 to do. The net effect is to permit them to
                            maintain a greater number of subs on station with the same force
                            level.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> pointed out that the
                            Soviets put up this installation in a hurry, something they do not
                            usually do. They apparently want to have it quickly as a fait accompli.
                            He believed the Soviets may want it in existence before the November 1

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> added that this was
                            his theory.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> to do a paper on military
                            implications. He asked if the Russians would store missiles at the base,
                            and inquired as to what we did.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> replied that we
                            keep weapons on the tender, and that is what they will undoubtedly
                            do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> both pointed out that the
                            Russians were doing just what we are doing in advanced areas.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said he was surprised
                            they had not done it sooner.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> also pointed out that
                            apart from the <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> angle, the number
                            of Y class subs becoming operational now made the establishment of this
                            kind of advanced base installation more sensible from the Russians'
                            viewpoint.</p>
                        <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0660"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then asked if it was
                            agreed that any decision we make in this regard must be on the
                            assumption that the base can be used for Y Class, not just attack subs;
                            in short, there was no point in trying to distinguish—the base is to be
                            assumed to be for both. All agreed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> suggested
                            that the strategic situation is different from 1962.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> agreed, saying this
                            does not change the balance very much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> agreed, pointing out
                            that the 1962 situation did constitute a major change of the strategic
                            balance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> said we must
                            nevertheless assess the matter carefully, and that one danger was to the
                            US bomber bases. The subs would have to get in close to our shore and
                            they would need about 4 to 5 Y Class subs to have a credible threat
                            against the bases.</p>
                        <p>All agreed with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                            observation that what the Russians are doing is comparable to our
                            building a sub base on the Black Sea.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that the
                            President wanted an <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> discussion of
                            this subject on Wednesday (Sept. 23) with just the major principals
                                concerned—<persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>.
                            This would be done after the regular <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            meeting. We will operate on the assumption that the base is designed for
                            Y Class subs and the question is whether a base of that kind requires a
                            US response and if so what it should be.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> again asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> to prepare a paper on
                            what the base does for Y Class subs, for attack subs, to the strategic
                            balance. The worldwide <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> naval
                            picture should be included.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked how we can get
                            a sense of Soviet perception of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> expressed the view
                            that it is a long-range naval plan; he did not think it was a nuclear
                            strike move, just a long-range buildup of power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> observed that the
                            Russians are doing the same thing in the Indian Ocean—they have built an
                            airfield on the “God-forsaken island” of Scotoa, which belongs to South
                            Yemen.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> stated it may be
                            just the beginning, and they might want to put up facilities in
                            Chile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said he would like to
                            talk to “Tommy” <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> on the
                            Soviet angle.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said that maybe
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLET1">Thompson</persName> should talk to the
                            whole group. They agreed that Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> would check with the President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would check with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, and they would be in
                            touch with each other.</p>
                        <p>It was further agreed that there would be a pre-<gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> meeting on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
                        <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0661"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> pointed out that the
                            jumpiest people in the world about Cuba are in the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> pointed out that the
                            only reason for some speed is that the story is likely to leak, and may
                            leak by Wednesday. Everyone agreed that they would just stone-wall
                            it.</p>
                        <p>In response to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s
                            question, everyone said they would prefer to think about the matter
                            before proceeding to discuss possible US responses. It was agreed that
                            consideration should proceed through the spectrum from doing nothing on
                            up, but at the moment the meeting had gone as far as it could.</p>

                        <p>As you know, the President is most interested in developments relating to
                            the Sino-Soviet border dispute. It would be helpful to have a
                                memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">On October 22, <persName

                                    corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> a paper entitled “Soviet
                                Force Level on Sino-Soviet Border,” under a covering memorandum that
                                read: “While [the enclosed report] cannot tell us definitively what
                                Soviet intentions are, it does indicate the extent and general
                                significance of the Soviet buildup. The buildup of Soviet forces has
                                been steady and methodical but is inadequate for a major and
                                prolonged offensive against the Chinese. The further buildup
                                required for a major offensive would amost certainly be detected by
                                intelligence.” The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> response is
                                    <ref target="#d227">Document 227</ref>.</note> which assesses
                            the significance of the continuing buildup of military forces on the
                            Soviet side of the border.</p>
                        <p>In particular, the memorandum should address the question of what the
                            present level of Soviet forces along the border tells us of their
                            intentions. It should address in particular the question of whether the
                            current Soviet strength in the border area is sufficient only for
                            defense against a possible Chinese attack or whether it is enough to
                            allow the Soviets to invade China and if so, how far into China. The
                            memorandum should also examine the question of what more, if anything,
                            we <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0662"/>might expect to see on the
                            Soviet side before an invasion, more trucks, armor, logistics buildup,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>If you agree, a due date of 7 October 1970, would be good.</p>

                        <p>In concentrating on the Soviet intention and plans regarding Cienfuegos,
                            we should not ignore the other side of the equation—what does Cuba get
                            out of lending its territory for this purpose? The answer would be
                            illuminating as to what Cienfuegos is all about.</p>
                        <p>Cienfuegos may be the key to a number of puzzling and otherwise
                            unexplainable things that have happened in the past two or three years: <list>
                                <label>(a)</label>
                                <item>Evidence that the Soviets are increasing their control over
                                    the Cuban regime, and some reports that Castro is unhappy at
                                    this and somewhat impotent. The attached memo which I sent to
                                    you on September 8 describes some of these; note Castro's
                                    alleged comment on Soviet “coldbloodedness and
                                    ruthlessness.”</item>
                                <label>(b)</label>
                                <item>In several speeches last Spring, castigating exile activity,
                                    Castro made curious references that they (exiles) would not
                                    stage out of Central America or the Bahamas if Cuba had long
                                    range military aircraft. He would add “but of course we don't.”
                                    However, the references were almost in the sense of “just
                                    wait.”</item>

                                <item>Cubanologists have long puzzled about why Castro made such a
                                    point of a ten million ton sugar harvest when it was such an
                                    improbable thing to achieve. The most interesting theory is one
                                    Rand researchers have developed linking back to Cuba's support
                                    of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in the
                                    Czechoslovakia crisis: <list>
                                        <item>—At that time Castro delayed for about a month before
                                            speaking out, and it seemed fairly clear that he was
                                            struggling with himself. He finally came out for the
                                            Soviets. If, the theory goes, the Soviets put the
                                            economic squeeze on him at that time because they needed
                                            his support in international socialist terms, Castro is
                                            the type to chafe at this dependence and seek to build
                                            his base to contest this kind of control.</item>
                                        <item>—The ten million ton harvest was a typical Castroist
                                            mission—the subjective willing of a goal—which if he
                                            succeeded would have refurbished his leadership and his
                                            charisma—and his control over the society.</item>
                                        <item>—To have failed and to have had to admit it decreases
                                            this control and leadership. He is now weaker; he
                                            gambled and lost. The Soviets can work their will with
                                            less sensitivity for Castro's wishes.</item>

                        <p>With reference to Cienfuegos, there are several possibilities; moreover,
                            they are not mutually exclusive: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Russians forced Cuba's consent with economic
                                    blackmail.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>They bribed Castro with promises of additional economic and
                                    military aid, and perhaps a promise of protection against
                                    overthrow.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>They bribed Castro's cooperation with promises to underwrite
                                    the export of revolution—Soviet naval units in the Caribbean
                                    could provide cover for clandestine guerrilla
                                    expeditions.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The last seems the least likely; to stimulate Castro's revolutionary
                            exploits again goes counter to every other stance they are taking as to
                            the via pacifica. On the other hand, the Russians could possibly have
                            made a conscious decision to press the erosion of US influence in the
                            continent by a variety of means.</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence of increased aid, either military or economic, but
                            that of course could be in the future. An intelligence effort to check
                            on weapons flow would be particularly interesting.</p>
                        <p>I am most intrigued, however, by the possibility that the Russians made a
                            cold decision and then proceeded to ram it down Castro's throat. It is a
                            tactical decision which may well have sprung out of their success in
                            forcing Castro to bow to their wishes on Czechoslovakia—if we accept
                            that theory for the moment. This may have made them realize—after
                            clashes with Castro's maverick ideology—that Cuba could be theirs in
                            absolute terms.</p>

                                    Increased Soviet Control Over Communist Party of Cuba and
                                    Reaction of Fidel Castro” is attached but not printed.</note>
                                indicating increased Soviet control over the Cuban Communist Party.
                                According to this report, the machinery of the Communist Party of
                                Cuba (PCC) is increasingly controlled by young Soviet-trained
                                officials whose primary loyalty is more to international Communism
                                than to Castro or Cuban revolution. Castro only recently became
                                aware of the extent of Soviet control when it was proposed that the
                                position of Prime Minister be occupied by some one other than the
                                Secretary General of the PCC. Since Castro holds both positions, the
                                proposal in effect was that he give up the Secretary
                                Generalship.</p>
                            <p>The report also cites Castro as commenting on Soviet “coldbloodedness
                                and ruthlessness” and that Latin American revolutionaries would have
                                to face opposition from both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Castro
                                is also reported to have said he believes part of Cuba's economic
                                problems are due to the rigidity of the Soviet style of
                                Soviet-trained officials.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Note that <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                    >CIA</gloss> suggests that the Cubans may have deliberately
                                surfaced this line to provoke a pro-Castro reaction among the
                                revolutionists abroad. While that is a possibility, there have been
                                several other reports indicating that there is some dissention
                                between the old 26th of July veterans of the revolution and the
                                younger technocrats who are largely Soviet-trained. There have also
                                been fairly firm reports of Soviet domination of the Cuban
                                intelligence apparatus, the DGI, and of increasing control of the
                                Foreign Ministery by “Sovietphyles.” A key figure in all this is
                                Carlos Raphael Rodriquez, the only old-time Communist party leader
                                to have survived the ten years of Castro's revolution. He is smart,
                                tough, and without any question the Soviets' man in Havana.</p>

                            <item>Our latest intelligence indicates that the Soviet Union may be
                                developing the port of Cienfuegos, Cuba, into a base capable of
                                supporting nuclear submarines. This is but the latest in a series of
                                moves that appear to fit into a pattern which indicates increasing
                                Soviet hostility toward the United States and a willingness to take
                                greater risks in pursuing objectives inimical to the security of the
                                United States. Several Soviet actions which illustrate this pattern

                                        represent a concentration of military power far in excess of

                                        occupation force has served to strengthen Soviet forces in

                            <item>Military implications of the Soviet pattern of increasing military
                                capabilities are clear. In the strategic field, they have attained a
                                position of relative strength that makes the US nuclear deterrent
                                credible only in extremis. They are developing the airlift, sealift,
                                and submarine forces to project and support military power
                                throughout the world. The establishment of Soviet bases in the
                                Western Hemisphere or Indian Ocean would spread our ASW forces
                                thinner, make our sea LOCS even more difficult to protect, and
                                enhance Soviet efforts to penetrate the areas economically and
                                politically. It would appear that the Soviet Union is boldly
                                pursuing more aggressive policies in the Middle East, Indian Ocean,
                                and Western Hemisphere.</item>

                                has been some ostensible cooperation in diplomatic moves. They have

                                continue to build while talking. They have signed a non-aggression

                                the possibility of a Conference on European Security and force
                                reductions in Europe. The Soviets urged the Arabs to accept a Middle
                                East ceasefire, but have assisted in violating the standstill
                                aspects of the ceasefire. (This makes one wonder how reliable Soviet
                                adherence to a <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> agreement would
                                be.) However, while professing peaceful intentions, military

                                threat to the United States due to the additional on-station time
                                and extra stations that could be covered, for example, in the Gulf

                                at Cienfuegos would have the effect of giving the Soviets a net
                                increase in available force levels.</item>

                            <item>If the foregoing assessment is valid, then appropriate
                                countermeasures appear necessary. They fall into two categories:
                                those dealing with the overall trend in Soviet capabilities, and
                                those focusing on the specific activity at Cienfuegos. The
                                countermeasures are, of course, related to our national objectives
                                which remain sound and should not be changed. In connection with the
                                overall expansion of Soviet capabilities, the following broad

                                will involve a cautious increase in aerial and off-shore
                                surveillance to detect levels of sea and shore activity, types and
                                numbers of vessels, types and quantities of equipment and supplies,
                                and personnel. If Cienfuegos does develop into an SSBN base, the

                                    <label>a.</label>

                                        understandings. This could involve a direct confrontation
                                        over such measures as quarantining Cienfuegos, boarding and
                                        search of enroute Soviet ships, surface and sub-surface
                                        surveillance of Soviet vessels, clandestine sabotage
                                        efforts, or placement of negotiation hazards. Additional

                                        confrontation, they would clearly erode our military

                                Hemisphere. The missile crisis in 1962 drew a line against Soviet
                                military expansion in this Hemisphere and we should toe that line
                                now even though our relative strategic posture has deteriorated
                                since October 1962. If we do not, the Soviets might mistake
                                acquiescence for weakness and be encouraged to develop other bases
                                in this Hemisphere. Accordingly, the following actions should be
                                undertaken: <list>

                                <p>The installation is similar to what we have in Holy Loch, and is
                                    of semi-permanent nature. It would appear at this point to have
                                    the capability of servicing submarines, including nuclear subs,
                                    and of providing rest and recreation facilities for naval crews
                                    as well as permanent support personnel. No other naval support
                                    capabilities are evident at this point.</p>

                            submarines, because of increased on-station time, to approximately
                            one-third of the size of the Soviet Ballistic Missile Submarine (SLBM)

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> further believe that this action
                            fits into an overall Soviet pattern which indicates increasing Soviet
                            hostility toward the U.S. and a willingness to take greater risks in
                            pursuing their objectives. In support of this contention they note,

                        <p>I share the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>'s concern with Soviet
                            intentions. I also share their concern over the increasing Soviet
                            military capabilities vis-à-vis the U.S. and this is a matter which we
                            are carefully analyzing. However, I believe the development of the port
                            of Cienfuegos into a base capable of supporting nuclear submarines would
                            add only marginally to the total Soviet capability for attacking the
                            U.S. with nuclear weapons. The fact of the matter is that there are
                            always some Soviet subs off our East Coast with the capability to launch
                            missiles against most targets in the U.S. If they want, the Soviets can
                            increase this number at any time by simply increasing their force
                            levels. Having a base at Cienfuegos makes it easier to achieve such an
                            objective but at considerably higher risks considering past U.S.
                            reactions to Soviet military activities in Cuba. Unlike 1962, the
                            Soviets have a massive land base missile capability which continues to
                            grow.</p>
                        <p>If my view that the increase in military capabilities of the Cienfuegos
                            base would be only marginal is correct, then the Soviet action becomes
                            even more puzzling. <hi rend="italic">Why run such high risks for such
                                low returns in increased military capability?</hi> This strongly
                            suggests that this Soviet move is perhaps more politically-motivated

                                    <item>—It could be argued that for some years, now, as their
                                        strategic power has grown, the Soviet leaders have wanted to
                                        even the score from the humiliation of 1962.</item>

                                <p>A double crisis of this magnitude, however, has always been an
                                    intriguing theory but a dangerous strategy. No one can foresee
                                    the consequences of inter-actions between two areas of
                                    contention. There is not only the danger of uncalculated
                                    escalation but the significant risk of a double defeat.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, Cuba would seem the last place the Soviets would want
                                    to invoke in a Middle East crisis. Cuba is, after all, still an
                                    area where we have immense tactical advantage.</p>

                                        <item>—The Soviets may have concluded that the Middle East

                                    are successful, however, as the news leaks out, the Soviets can
                                    demonstrate to much of the world that the correlation of forces
                                    has shifted significantly since their defeat in Cuba almost
                                    exactly eight years ago. <hi rend="italic">In short, this is a

                                <p>The fact that on two separate occasions the Soviets have
                                    deliberately deceived us may be an important symptom of the mood
                                    of the Soviet leaders, and an index of their assessment of us.
                                    It suggests an ominous contempt and a judgment that we are not
                                    likely to react quickly or vigorously to Soviet challenges. Why
                                    they should hold such a view, if they do, is never easy to
                                    understand. It could relate to what they may perceive as our

                                <p>In any case, the Soviets have been moving aggressively, first in

                                    do so until they receive clear and unmistakable warning

                        <p>Why did Cuba agree to lend its territory for this purpose? What does
                            Castro get out of it?</p>
                        <p>Conceivably Castro may have asked for such a facility to obtain a more
                            demonstrative show of support, or the base decision could have been the
                            result of mutual initiative based on mutually perceived advantages.
                            However, a more plausible thesis is that this was a Soviet initiative.
                            The Soviets clearly have the leverage to obtain Cuban cooperation—either
                            by blackmail in threatening to stop essential economic <pb n="641"
                                xml:id="pg_641" facs="0674"/>support or by bribes in the form of
                            more economic and military aid. This would explain a number of otherwise
                            puzzling reports we have received over the past year or so. For example,
                            there have been increasing reports of Soviet attempts to increase their
                            control and influence within the Cuban regime. There have been reports
                            of Castro's uneasiness at this, and of his alleged comments about Soviet
                            “coldbloodedness and ruthlessness.” Failure of Castro's highly touted
                            effort to harvest ten million tons of sugar is a heavy blow which
                            damaged his charisma and control. The Soviets could well have felt that
                            they could pressure him without being as concerned about his sensitivity
                            as they have been in the past. In any event, they appear to have more
                            influence and authority in Cuba now than at any time in recent
                            years.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the case, the Cubans do receive—in return for use of their
                            territory—Soviet military presence with its implicit promise of Soviet
                            support and protection. They could conceivably use an expanded Soviet
                            naval presence in the area to cover their clandestine subversive
                            movements. They presumably have received expanded economic and military
                            aid.</p>

                                            would be no less easy for us than striking one with the
                                            Soviets. Moreover, if the Soviets induced or pressured
                                            Castro into standing firm, the chances of a fait
                                            accompli would be great and we would face it without yet
                                            having made our position clear to the Soviets. They
                                            could take our delay in approaching them as a sign that

                        <p>In my view the slow diplomatic approach has serious risks. It may seem
                            safer but most likely it would result in a gradually escalating crisis
                            leading ultimately to confrontation. At the same time, moving
                            immediately to military confrontation may be needlessly risky until we
                            have probed to see what the Soviets intentions really are. But whatever
                            our initial course, we must be prepared to move toward confrontation if
                            this is the price of Soviet withdrawal.</p>

                            strategic posture seems, at first glance, not to be worth much in the

                                            interpretation</hi> is that the actions of establishing
                                        a semi-permanent facility seem to go well beyond showing the
                                        flag. No Soviet leader in his right mind could imagine that
                                        such a move could be passed over by an American
                                        administration. If this explanation is implausible, then we
                                        probably must assume that the Soviets are well aware of the
                                        crisis potential of their actions. They could thus be aiming
                                        for (1) a deliberate provocation designed intentionally to
                                        create a second Cuban confrontation; or (2) a move not
                                        designed to become an issue of confrontation as such, but
                                        part of a longer-term pattern of Soviet expansionist policy,
                                        of which this is one important—but not decisive test.</p>

                                        looked ahead and saw the Middle East rapidly escalating to a
                                        dangerous point. They could have reasoned that it was to
                                        their strategic advantage to widen the arena of potential
                                        conflict with the US, in part to put pressures on us from at

                                                crisis, but in their arrogance, will brazen it
                                                through. Such a line of actions cannot be easily

                                                has grown, the Soviet leaders have wanted to even
                                                the score from the humiliation of 1962.</item>

                                        leadership, they seem to behave with a strong element of
                                        pragmatism and prudence rather than adventurism. A double
                                        crisis has always been intriguing theory but dangerous
                                        strategy. No one can foresee the consequences of
                                        inter-actions between two areas of contention. There is not
                                        only the danger of uncalculated escalation but the
                                        significant risk of a double defeat.</p>
                                    <p>But above all, Cuba would seem the last place the Soviets
                                        would want to invoke a Middle-East crisis. Cuba is, after
                                        all, still an area where we have immense tactical
                                            advantages.<note n="2" xml:id="d213fn2">It is not
                                            inconceivable that the Cuban venture is related to
                                            Chile. For example, the Soviets, if challenged, might
                                            try to extend the 1962 non-invasion pledge to include
                                            nonintervention in Chile, if in return the Soviets
                                            abjured any permanent naval facilities in the Caribbean.

                                        expansionism symbolized primarily by a naval presence. Under

                                        us for a reaction, and having estimated that we were

                                        following their earlier naval visits to Cuba and flights of

                                            own, not Cuban objectives); to show that the balance of
                                            power is now such that we can no longer effectively
                                            block Soviet power even in our own sphere of

                                        US reaction to the establishment of facilities that could be
                                        defended as minimal and temporary, of no immediate threat to
                                        the US.</p>
                                    <p>In short, the Soviets may have embarked on a calculated risk
                                        to test whether they can break out of the spirit of the 1962
                                        restrictions on <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647" facs="0680"
                                        />their actions. They tested the waters and decided that we
                                        would not make a major issue of their moves. And in the
                                        process, as the news leaks out, the Soviets could
                                        demonstrate to much of the world that the correlation of
                                        forces has shifted significantly since the black days of
                                        their defeat almost exactly eight years ago.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>If the first and third explanations are close to the mark, it means we
                            are dealing, not with a major strategic-political showdown of worldwide
                            proportions, but with a limited challenge supported by some rational
                            Soviet calculations (however wrong that calculation may be). The
                            important aspect is that such a line of strategy includes, presumably,
                            built-in lines of retreat. Once confronted with an appreciation of the
                            limits of their actions, the Soviets can fall back on a diplomatic
                            scenario, perhaps to renegotiate the terms of the 1962 understanding,
                            and determine just what they can and cannot do. (A new “guarantee” for
                            Cuba might be all they could salvage.)</p>
                        <p>If, however, the second explanation is correct, then we are confronted
                            with a line of conduct based on entirely different and perhaps
                            irrational calculations. If the Soviets want a deliberate crisis, they
                            will disregard diplomacy and reinforce their own actions (more building,
                            submarines, etc.) Such a strategy is so unpredictable that no
                            countermoves can be prescribed to have any given effect. If we are
                            facing this situation, however, it would be of the utmost urgency to
                            determine it now.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that the third explanation, a test of expansionism, is
                            probably the right one, and if faced with the consequences of their
                            actions the Soviets will bristle and bargain but will, if permitted to
                            do so quietly, withdraw from the Carribbean.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The fact that on two separate occasions the Soviets have deliberately
                            deceived us may be an important symptom of the mood of the Soviet
                            leaders, and an index of their assessment of us. It suggests an ominous
                            contempt and a judgment that we are not likely to react quickly or
                            vigorously to Soviet challenges. Why they should hold such a view, if
                            they do, it is never easy to understand. It could relate to excessive
                            eagerness in <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> or perhaps their view
                            of the domestic effects of Vietnam, or their distorted views of our
                            social-economic “crisis” (e.g., the Arbatov article).<note n="4"

                        </p>
                        <p>In any case, it is reasonably clear that the Soviets have been moving
                            aggressively, first in the Middle East, and now in Cuba. They are likely
                            to continue to do so until they receive clear and unmistakable warning
                            signals. Then, and only then, will they hedge their bets.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by stating that there would be two
                            topics on the morning's agenda—the first a review of the situation in
                            Jordan and the second a sensitive discussion of the latest intelligence
                            on the situation in Cienfuegos Bay in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows an intelligence briefing and discussion on Jordan.]</p>
                        <p>He [Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>] suggested
                            that the group now turn from the Jordanian problem to the problem of
                            Cuba. The President cautioned the group that the discussion on Cuba was
                            limited to a strictly need-to-know group, pointing out that we were
                            faced with a major election issue which opponents could seize upon for
                            their own domestic political advantage. He cautioned each of the
                            principals to hold the information strictly to themselves and to take
                            equivalent action on any paperwork associated with the Cuban issue.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                            to present an update briefing on the Cuban situation to the group. Mr.

                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> stated that it was important that
                            we proceed with the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

                            limitation on the [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] adding that the experience in Cuba confirmed the
                                <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0682"/>importance of providing for

                            would have helped us along the Suez Canal. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> replied, “Yes, providing it had
                            been scheduled properly.” He also pointed out that the Real-Time-Readout
                            camera would be of great benefit [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            not these systems would not be an important factor in the policing of
                            any <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> agreement. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> confirmed that, indeed, these
                            would be important technological assets for us. The President then
                            stated that he wanted no more budgetary nibblings on [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] or the
                            Real-Time-Readout capability and stated that these systems were too
                            important and must be funded. He added, somewhat jokingly, that the
                            Department of Defense could pay for these systems out of its funds.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> continued with his
                            prepared briefing and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> asked when the construction in Cienfuegos and
                            Alcatraz Island actually started. Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1"
                                >Helms</persName> stated that we had our first evidence this spring.
                            He stated that in August we noted the athletic facilities and all
                            believed that it was significant that there were no baseball fields—only
                            soccer fields, suggesting Soviet occupation rather than Cuban. The
                            President commented that the dates were very important and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> replied that he would try to get
                            a firm verification on the precise dates when various stages of the
                            construction were initiated. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> said that the construction had moved extremely
                            rapidly and <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> commented that
                            all of the work had been done within 30 days from the period August 15
                            to September 15.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> then commented that
                            if the Soviets increased their SLBN levels to 41 and put a portion of
                            them in Cuba that the Cienfuegos facility would give them what would
                            amount to 10–12 additional submarines. The facility would also enable
                            them to penetrate more deeply into the Gulf of Mexico and therefore
                            enhance their targeting capabilities within the central United States.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> concluded that if the
                            Cienfuegos base is, in fact, a permanent submarine support facility, it
                            will have the effect of increasing Soviet force levels.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> next stated that we
                            are watching the situation very carefully through U–2 flights at a
                            minimum of one every three days. He reported that the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are developing an attack plan and a
                            plan for trailing Soviet submarines as well. He remarked that the
                            Soviets themselves maintain surveillance trawlers adjacent to all U.S.
                            bases.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> then asked Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> to comment on the [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            which were picked up from one of the Soviet vessels. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> stated that they had overflown
                            with detection aircraft one of the Soviet vessels enroute to Cienfuegos
                            and <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0683"/>had received positive
                            evidence of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] from the vessel. However, following departure of
                            the vessel from Cienfuegos a similar flight did not pick up such [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. The President stated that this suggested that they
                            have already stored some nuclear components in Cienfuegos.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName>
                            what additional surveillance besides U–2's we had undertaken. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> responded that the Navy has a
                            destroyer right in international waters close by and stated that the
                            Soviets are aware of its presence. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> asked if we have positive evidence that they have
                            or intend to have nuclear weapons stored on shore in Cuba. The President
                            stated that in his view whether the weapons are on the tenders or on
                            shore, this would constitute a violation of the nebulous 1962
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> replied that they
                            have built a dock and have established permanent buoys, and that storage
                            can be effected afloat or on shore. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> agreed that this would be a
                            violation. The President stated that anyone familiar with the problem
                            would agree that it would constitute a serious violation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> stated that current Soviet
                            tactics we have observed permit the Soviets to transfer missiles from
                            Soviet tenders to the submarines at sea, so that storage on the tenders
                            alone constitutes an important military asset for the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The President then pointed out that the situation was especially serious
                            in view of the exchange between Vorontsov and the White House in
                                August,<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">See <ref target="#d192">Document
                                    192</ref>.</note> since at that time, Vorontsov had given the
                            U.S. assurances that they would abide by the earlier understanding and
                            asked us to do the same. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> stated that his understanding of the so-called
                            agreement was that we agreed not to invade Cuba in return for the
                            removal of offensive missiles from Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that there was no agreement as such but
                            merely a series of parallel statements. He stated that the U.S.
                            conditions were open-ended and provided that we would not invade if
                            adequate inspection were established whereby the removal of offensive
                            weapons could be verified. The Soviets, in turn, never delivered on the
                            inspection issue. Therefore, in effect, there is no binding agreement
                            and we never gave any additional pledges.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what has been said recently on the subject. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated that on
                            August 4 [5], there was a scare report of a Cuban exile attack against a
                            Soviet trawler<note n="4" xml:id="d214fn4">See <ref target="#d193"
                                    >Document 193</ref>.</note> and that he, <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>, had assured Vorontsov that
                            we were taking protective action in behalf of the Soviet vessel
                            traveling to Cuba. Vorontsov, in turn, had told <pb n="651"
                                xml:id="pg_651" facs="0684"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> that the Soviets wished
                            to use the occasion to reaffirm the understandings of 1962.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked whether or not <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> had the capability to re-institute the exile program
                            against Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> stated
                            that this capability had been dismantled. The President commented that
                            obviously there was no real understanding, and Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> confirmed this. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> stated that, in any
                            event, it was a very fuzzy understanding.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> commented that we
                            must now consider whether we want to reaffirm our position with respect
                            to Cuba. The President stated that the important thing today is to think
                            about this issue very carefully. The U.S. could consider sending a note
                            to the Soviets but where would we go from there? The alternatives must
                            be carefully considered. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2"
                                >Laird</persName> stated that the whole issue will surface very
                            shortly. He pointed out that it had come up in conference on the
                            military authorization bill and was discussed openly. The issue added
                            more effect to the conference, adding $25 million more for U.S. ships.
                            He stated that the issue will surface just the same as it did in 1962
                            and the timing is important. The U.S. must consider and be prepared on
                            how it will handle this issue very quickly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then commented that
                            the U.S. also had to consider the international political implications
                            of the Soviet action. Why, for example, had they chosen this point to
                            install a base? Why also would the Soviets try to reaffirm the 1962
                            understandings and then 11 days later move precipitously to install
                            strategic weapons in Cuba? What is the relationship with this action and
                            the situation in Chile and what are its implications should Chile go
                            Marxist? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> stated
                            that the political consequences of the Soviet action present a most
                            serious dilemma and transcend the purely military strategic implications
                            of the Soviet action. The real question, he stated, was why have the
                            Soviets undertaken this move directly against the spirit, if not the
                            letter, of the 1962 understandings?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> reported that they
                            have three Y-class submarines now targeted on the U.S. and that this
                            would increase that capability. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> stated that he hoped that the United States would
                            not pull any alarm bells until after the Congressional election. He
                            suggested that if the Soviet action leaks, then it will be necessary to
                            low-key our response. It would be disastrous to have this break between
                            now and elections. Therefore, it is essential that this group react very
                            carefully to the intelligence presented. The President stated that our
                            problem is not to react to the Soviets in a blustering way. He stated
                            that the U.S. needs to low-key the issue for the present. We should
                            respond with the fact that the government is aware of the situation,
                            that we are watching it very carefully, that we consider the
                            understandings of 1962 <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0685"/>in
                            effect, and that we will hold the Soviets to that. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> interjected that this action
                            should be tied into the Soviets world-wide naval expansion. The
                            President directed the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> to develop
                            a suggested U.S. public response if the intelligence information breaks.
                            He also directed the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1">WSAG</gloss> to prepare a
                            suggested line to take officially with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented that, in his view, the new base would
                            constitute a marginal strategic advantage. Therefore, it might be that
                            the Soviets thought out the implications of this action very carefully
                            for other political reasons. In either event, the President stated, it
                            is desirable to keep the discussion within the group assembled in the
                            room. That group, the President stated, knows what is actually being
                            done by the Soviets and all understand that there can be no Soviet
                            offensive weapons in Cuba. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that he regretted the necessity of
                            playing the role of a villain on this issue. The President interrupted,
                            stating that what he had been referring to was the public U.S. position.
                            It was necessary, the President noted, that in private we must be very
                            tough but that this line was to be taken privately. If we are to take a
                            tough public stance, we will set up a great domestic clamor. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> reiterated that it was
                            necessary to keep all discussions and information within this particular
                            group. The President stated we need, in effect, two lines: (1) a public
                            line designed to preclude a crisis atmosphere, and (2) an official line
                            to take privately with the Soviets. It will be necessary to consider
                            this line most seriously and it was essential that our concerns be
                            brought forcefully to Soviet attention. In public, however, we should
                            merely take the stance that we are aware of the situation and are
                            watching it carefully. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that the important aspect of our public
                            line is not to permit the Soviets to think that what they have done is
                            acceptable. The President agreed, stating that it was true, that we had
                            to be sure that the Soviets know that their acts were unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> then stated again
                            that the whole situation was soon to break and that it was important
                            that the Soviets know our stand before it breaks publicly—not after.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> asked what the
                            United States would do if the Soviets were to ignore our warning. What
                            action could the United States take to show that it is serious? It is
                            important that the U.S. is able to back up its words with deeds.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> stated that we
                            might consider moving strategic bombers into Turkey. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said, “What about Cuba, itself,
                            if we take naval action around Cuba?” Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> replied that we need more ships
                            in the area and more surveillance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> added that he did
                            not visualize our being able to do anything in Guantanamo. The President
                            asked if we could blockade Cuba or mine Cienfuegos Harbor. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> confirmed that this was
                            possible. The President stated that he wanted us to refrain from
                            restraining the Cuban exile community from acting against Cuba. He
                            wanted to consider the possibility of a new blockade with surface <pb
                                n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0686"/>ships and the possibility of
                            mining the entrance to the harbor. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1"
                                >Moorer</persName> added that we should initiate a trailing program
                            with respect to Soviet ships traveling to and from Cuba. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> stated he would
                            implement this immediately.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> said the
                            important thing is how it is all done. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_WSAG1"
                                >WSAG</gloss>, which was in effect the same group as in this room,
                            would work out a careful scenario for Presidential decision. The
                            President stated that two problems existed—the first was the problem of
                            our public posture. This was to be accomplished with calmness, an
                            expression of awareness of the situation, but above all, in such a way
                            that it is low-key. The danger would be that we would take a bellicose
                            public stance which would force the Soviets to react in the same way.
                            The second problem concerned the official line. The President indicated
                            he wanted strong U.S. action. He wanted to make it clear that the U.S.
                            could not permit the establishment of a Soviet strategic base in Cuba.
                            In his view, the President stated, even though the strategic balance has
                            changed drastically since 1962 the Soviets would never trade Russia for
                            Havana.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_LMR2">Laird</persName> then stated again
                            that it would be difficult to hold this any longer. He reiterated that
                            he had been asked three times on the Hill about Cuban intelligence.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> suggested that
                            we prepare a scenario without anyone knowing. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> commented that he could prepare
                            one himself. The President pointed out that this was a special case with
                            particular impact domestically. It may already be clear what the Soviets
                            are up to. They may step up their activities world-wide and this may
                            only be the beginning. The President stated that the group should meet
                            again at noon the following day.</p>

                        <p>The group met briefly for the purpose of discussing contingency press
                            guidance to be used in the event that information concerning a Soviet
                            base in Cuba became known publicly.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> began the meeting by
                            cautioning that it was necessary to be prepared for possible press
                            stories on the Cuban base. He suggested that the Government's public
                            response be along the following lines: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We are aware of the reports. The President has reviewed these
                                    reports with his senior advisors. The Soviets are well aware of
                                    the fact that establishment of a base would be of great concern
                                    to us. We are keeping the situation under constant review.”</p>
                            </quote>
                        </p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> stated
                            that, because of the statements made by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> in 1962, we could emphasize
                            that the Soviets are well aware of the seriousness with which we would
                            view such a development. He suggested that we use President <persName
                                corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName>'s language when he stated that
                            we would expect that they would be kept out of this hemisphere in the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> commented that we
                            wouldn't want to imply that if the Soviets stopped now, we would
                            acquiesce in what they have done.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> then commented that
                            we were dealing with a period of 10 days or so and asked whether we
                            couldn't get by with reassuring reports along the lines that ever since
                            1962 we have been concerned about missiles in Cuba and have been
                            checking the situation and will continue to check.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> remarked that
                            because so many analysts were now aware of recent developments, there
                            were two dangers: (1) it might be built into a Cuban missile crisis, and
                            (2) on the other hand, if we kept it too low-key, then the Congress
                            might build it up.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> indicated that he
                            was worried about saying that the President had been briefed, feeling
                            that this might dignify the situation. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> interjected that we have to say that the
                            President has been briefed on the situation.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> then spoke of the
                            difference between a naval base and a naval base with special equipment.
                            He pointed out that we know there is special equipment at Cienfuegos.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> remarked, “But
                            we haven't seen submarines.”</p>
                        <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0688"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then indicated that
                            we needed to find a happy medium that would keep the public calm and
                            quiet and at the same time stir up the Soviets enough to get them to
                            close down the base.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> commented that
                            he wanted to see more information before drawing a final conclusion
                            about what is actually going on in Cienfuegos. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> asked him if it would be
                            acceptable if the Soviets stopped what they were doing right where they
                            were. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> replied,
                            “No.” He would say he knows of reports but wants more information.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> stated that the
                            Soviets have done everything necessary to provide a base. All the
                            fundamental elements are there now. Even if the ship leaves, the buoys
                            and the communications are there. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> then asked what we wanted the Soviets to take
                            out. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> answered, “It
                            boils down to whether we will let them use it.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> then turned to the
                            issue of whether to mention the President in the statement or not. He
                            suggested doing two statements which would be distributed to the
                            principals. The President could then decide.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MTH1">Moorer</persName> then stated that
                            there should be mention in the statement of previous Soviet
                            deployments.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> cautioned the group
                            that nothing should be said to the Soviets until a scenario had been
                            developed. The President wanted to have such a scenario worked out.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> closed the meeting
                            by summarizing the consensus of the group. He asked Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_PDM1">Packard</persName> to submit what the Defense
                            Department proposed to say limited purely to the facts of the situation.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would prepare a
                            statement along the lines outlined at the meeting and dealing with the
                            political aspects of the question. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> stated that he would blend these submissions
                            into a composite set of instructions for the guidance of all. The
                            guidance would be used as follows: Defense would limit itself to
                            responses dealing with the facts of the situation but only if pressed.
                            Any questions on the political issue or contacts with the Soviets should
                            be handled by State or the White House as appropriate.</p>

                                if it is just routine I can't do it.” (Ibid.)</note> and he is
                            extremely occupied tomorrow and is going to Camp David tomorrow night.
                            What he wonders is if you could give me the messages. If there is
                            anything warranting a personal reply from him he will see you later in

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called the
                            evening of September 24th to tell me that he had a personal message for
                            the President from his leadership and that he wanted to have an
                            appointment with the President the next day. In view of the newly
                            discovered Soviet base in Cuba, the President and I thought it unwise to
                            have such a meeting. Therefore, I told <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> that he would have to deliver the note to me
                            and only after reading it could it be judged whether it would be
                            worthwile for him to see the President. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that his instructions
                            were to deliver it to the President and he would consequently have to
                            check with Moscow whether he could deliver it to me. He <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0692"/>added that this reflected no lack of
                            trust in me and that he would, of course, be glad to chat with me for
                            half an hour before we saw the President. I said that unfortunately it
                            was impossible to see the President and, therefore, his choice was
                            between delivering it to me or waiting until after the President came
                            back from his European trip.<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">

                        <p>I met with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in
                            the Map Room. After an exchange of pleasantries, he made the following
                            point. His government had studied the proposal of a Summit with great
                            interest and as the Soviet Government had already indicated, it was
                            ready to proceed in principle. The Soviet Government agreed in general
                            to the agenda outlined in our previous communication.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d218fn3">See Tab A, <ref target="#d198">Document
                                198</ref>.</note> It also agreed that Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and I should proceed with
                            exploratory conversations. The Soviet Government wondered about the site
                            of the conference and whether the President was perhaps thinking of
                            Moscow. It also asked for the President's views about the best time for
                            such a meeting and specifically whether it should be in the first half
                            or the second half of the year. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> added that actually it could not take place
                            before May because of the Soviet Party Congress. I replied that given
                            the weather conditions, what the Ambassador was really asking was
                            whether it should be in the last half of the first half or the first
                            half of the last half of the year—in other words, whether it should be
                            in June or in July or September, August probably being a vacation month
                            for both sides. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> stated that this was essentially correct.
                            During this portion of the discussion, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also informed me that Premier
                                <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would not be
                            attending the United Nations 25th Anniversary Celebration in New York
                            this fall. I told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> I would let him know later about our views on a
                            possible Summit. At this point in the conversation, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> tried to initiate a
                            conversation on the Middle East and other problems, but I cut him off by
                            saying that these subjects were too complex and that too many things had
                            happened to enable us to discuss them in a semi-social way. I added that
                            if he wished to discuss these subjects, we should schedule a meeting and
                            I would then be prepared to do so.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that
                            Moscow was struck by the fact that the U.S. had never replied to its
                                note<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">On September 21, Vorontsov
                                presented to <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> the Soviet
                                reply to the U.S. request that the Soviets urge Syria to pull back
                                from Jordan. The Soviet reply is in telegram 155169 to Moscow,
                                September 22. According to the telegram, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                    >Sisco</persName> and Vorontsov then had the following exchange:
                                    “<persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked Vorontsov
                                whether we should understand this statement to mean the Soviet
                                Government is taking steps to bring about withdrawal of Syrian
                                forces from Jordan. Vorontsov said he did not have information
                                regarding the exact nature of the contacts taking place but that the
                                Soviet Union was using all its influence in contacts with Syria.”

                            invasion. Were we not interested in consulting with Moscow on Mideast
                            developments? I said that certainly we were willing to discuss them with
                            Moscow but it seemed to us that over a period of weeks every Soviet
                            démarche had been followed by the contrary action and we simply wanted
                            to wait to see what would happen. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said we might not believe it but the Soviet
                            Union had not known of the invasion of Jordan by Syria and that in any
                            event Soviet advisors had dropped off Syrian tanks prior to crossing the
                            frontier. I let this somewhat contradictory statement go and told
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that I would ask the
                            President's views about consultation on Mideast issues. I added that the
                            United States Government was always prepared to discuss the situation
                            with the Soviet Union in times of international crises. Our ability to
                            do so, however, was quite dependent on the degree of confidence which
                            existed between us and our overall relationships in general. In light of
                            Soviet violations of the ceasefire and Soviet responsibility for the
                            violations—or what we considered Soviet responsibility for unloosening
                            some of the forces that produced the crisis—the Jordanian situation did
                            not provide the atmosphere for a frank exchange of views between our
                            governments. In principle, however, we were prepared to discuss such
                            matters with the Soviet Government. I added that the United States had
                            no intention of launching military operations in Jordan if other outside
                            forces stayed out of Jordan. The meeting adjourned.</p>

                        <p>What the Soviets have done in Cienfuegos is so ambiguous that avoiding a
                            severe political setback in dealing with it will be exceedingly
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>First of all, what is in place now cannot persuasively be described as an
                            immediate or direct military risk for the United States. This
                            installation could remain there for a year or more without much change.
                            Indeed, the fact that something of this nature has been known to be in
                            the works for almost a month is, in itself, a de facto evidence that we
                            have not regarded the installation per se as a cause for serious
                            challenge to the Soviets. Moreover, if Soviet ships or submarines do not
                            use the installation in the next month or so, how can we, with much
                            credibility, claim that it has suddenly become a serious matter. The
                            only conceivable grounds for doing so is to claim that what appeared to
                            be temporary now has become permanent, and is definitely under Soviet
                            control.</p>
                        <p>The question arises: permanent for what?</p>
                        <p>As long as no Soviet warships or submarines visit Cienfuegos it can be
                            credibly claimed by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Cuba
                            that all that has happened is that the port of Cienfuegos has been
                            slightly improved. Our claim that this is in fact a Soviet base area
                            will not be very convincing; it rests on pictures of new barracks, and a
                            soccer field, and the prior presence of Soviet naval ships which have
                            now left. In other words, the time when it might have been legitimately
                            described as a Soviet base may have passed. (The fact that the ships
                            remaining are Soviet is still an important point.)</p>

                                <item>—Can we deny the Cubans the right to improve port facilities;

                                <item>—Thus, the installation in itself cannot be easily
                                    challenged.</item>
                                <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0695"/>
                                <item>—Only certain aspects of the installation could be challenged;
                                    namely the submarine tender and the submarine nets, which are
                                    the only physical presence that can be tied directly to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and which could
                                    conceivably be associated with strategic offensive
                                    weapons.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, we face the possibility that the only legitimate and persuasive
                            grounds for challenge may be the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the
                            facility by certain types of vessels, rather than the facility
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>In effect, this means we may have to swallow a de facto Soviet base, and
                            concentrate on denying its use in any way that would contravene the 1962
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>But, if this is the outcome, we must also recognize that the Soviets will
                            have taken an important forward step, and that much of the world will
                            regard this as a political setback for the United States.</p>
                        <p>The alternative is to decide what specific part of the installation must
                            be removed in order to clearly demonstrate that we are not tolerating a
                            Soviet base.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this virtually means making a crisis over three barges and
                            one submarine tender. Thus, to be convincing we are going to have to
                            complete a history of Soviet activities that demonstrate an expanding
                            Soviet military presence in Cuba, of which Cienfuegos is the last
                            straw.</p>
                        <p>Cienfuegos will have to be challenged along with flight of strategic
                            aircraft, the guided missile ships, the Castro speeches, and the Y-Class
                            submarines patrolling in the Atlantic. If we go this route we should
                            recognize that we are shifting the conflict from a strict interpretation
                            of the 1962 understanding to a larger issue of the Soviet presence, and
                            not focussing on Cienfuegos alone. This, of course, is not necessarily a
                            definition of the conflict that is easy to sustain, but it may be the
                            only persuasive political ground from which to attack the rather
                            rudimentary facilities that currently exist in Cuba.</p>
                        <p>In short, we can choose between making the issue Cienfuegos only, and
                            restricting its usage, or on the Soviet naval presence implied by
                            Cienfuegos.</p>

                            I called Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to
                            tell him that I wished to see him briefly to provide our answer on the
                            Summit. Just after I completed this phone call, the Defense Department,
                            due to a misunderstanding, released full details about Soviet naval
                            activity in Cienfuegos. Interdepartmental contingency guidance had
                            provided that minimum information would be released publicly on this
                            subject and specific guidance had been circulated to all Departments.
                            This unauthorized release had in turn led to my making the statement
                            that had been agreed to as governmental guidance in event that the
                            Soviet installations in Cienfuegos became known. Attached is that
                            portion of my press backgrounder given earlier that afternoon dealing
                            with Cuba.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">Attached but not printed.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>When I saw <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> in the Map
                            Room his face was ashen. I began the conversation by saying that I had
                            the President's answer on the Summit and that the answer was as follows.
                            In principle, the President was willing to consider a Summit. Further,
                            the President would consider either June or September 1971 as
                            appropriate dates and the U.S. Government was willing to consider Moscow
                            as the site for such a meeting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said this was very good news. But, he clearly
                            had his mind on the Cuban problem.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Cuba</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I then told the Ambassador that I wanted to talk to him about the press
                            statements that had been made in both the Pentagon and at the White
                            House earlier that afternoon. I called his attention to the fact that
                            the announcement made in the White House had inferred that the U.S. <pb
                                n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0697"/>Government did not yet know
                            whether there was actually a submarine base in Cuba. The U.S. Government
                            had done this deliberately in order to give the Soviet Union an
                            opportunity to withdraw without a public confrontation. I wanted him to
                            know that we had no illusions, that we knew already there was a
                            submarine base in Cuba, and that we would view it with the utmost
                            gravity if construction continued and the base remained. I added that we
                            did not want a public confrontation and were, therefore, giving them an
                            opportunity to pull out. But we would not shrink from other measures
                            including public ones if forced into it. I said that the President
                            considered the Vorontsov démarche of August 4<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d220fn4">See Tab A, <ref target="#d192">Document
                                192</ref>.</note> followed by the construction of the base as an act
                            of bad faith. If the ships—especially the tender—left Cienfuegos we
                            would consider the whole matter a training exercise. No more would be
                            said and there would be no publicity. This is why the President had
                            asked me to talk to him “unofficially.” Otherwise, we would put matters
                            into official channels. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> asked whether I was telling him that this
                            alleged base violated the understandings. I said this was a legalistic
                            question. I did believe it violated the understandings but I wanted to
                            remind him that in 1962 we took the most drastic action even though
                            there was no prior understanding. To us Cuba was a place of extreme
                            sensitivity. We considered the installation to have been completed with
                            maximum deception and we could not agree to its continuation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would have to report
                            to his government. And he would hope to have an answer for me soon.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador tried to discuss other matters such as the Middle East but
                            I cut him off and said that this was the only subject I was authorized
                            to discuss with him. He said why do you have to give me good news and
                            bad news simultaneously; it would be very confusing in Moscow. I said I
                            was giving him the news that now existed. I added that the U.S. and the
                            Soviets had reached a turning point in their relationships. It is now up
                            to the Soviets whether to go the hard route—whether it wanted to go the
                            route of conciliation or the route of confrontation. The United States
                            is prepared for either. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that probably the U.S. Government will
                            start a big press campaign on this Cuban business. I said we were not
                            going to do that but we were also determined that there would be no
                            Soviet submarine base in Cuba since whatever the phraseology of the
                            understanding its intent was clearly not to replace land-based by
                            sea-based missiles in Cuba. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that he would consult with Moscow and let
                            me know.</p>

                        <p>After an extended discussion of the situation in the Mediterranean,
                            Senator Percy asked what the State Department position was on the
                            construction of a Soviet Submarine Base in Cuba. He said that he had
                            been asked about this subject by a newspaper reporter the previous day
                            and was convinced that he was going to get more questions on this topic.
                            Without official guidance, he said, Senators and Members of Congress
                            would begin to formulate their own positions on the subject because of
                            the pressure of public concern. He mentioned Congressman Mendel Rivers'
                            statement as a case in point.</p>
                        <p>The other Senators strongly endorsed Senator Percy's statement and began
                            asking questions about the nature of the Soviet installation and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s intended response to it. The
                            State Department participants initially attempted to avoid a direct
                            answer on the grounds that complete information on the nature of the
                            installation was unavailable, and therefore a decision on our policy in
                            this matter was premature.<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">On September 26,

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Abshire</persName> then informed the Senators that the
                            Administration had not yet decided its position on this issue and that
                            we had been enjoined by the President from making any further statements
                            on the subject until his return from Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Senators then insisted that we communicate with the President and
                            inform him of their feeling that public concern was reaching a critical
                            stage and that without firm guidance from the Administration the
                            President would find himself plagued with a rash of public statements,
                            many of them unhelpful, by Senators and Congressmen. They emphasized
                            that they were anxious to support the Administration on this issue, but
                            could not do so without guidance and could not remain publicly silent on
                            this subject much longer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Abshire</persName> assured them that we would communicate
                            their concern to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"

                        <p>In a luncheon conversation arranged to discuss procedural aspects of the
                            forthcoming <gloss target="#t_SALT1">SALT</gloss> talks in Helsinki,
                            Vorontsov took the initiative in raising the subject of American
                            agitation over a possible Soviet <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0700"
                            />naval base in Cienfuegos in Cuba. He said that we could expect the
                            subject to be mentioned at Helsinki, that <persName corresp="#p_SVS1"
                                >Semenov</persName> would no doubt refer in more than one statement
                            to the inconsistency of an American position opposing Soviet proposals
                            for abolition of overseas bases and limitation on missile submarine
                            deployment, while maintaining such bases, and then objecting to the fact
                            that the Soviet Union might get such a base itself. Vorontsov said there
                            was no reason for the US to be concerned. I replied that I hoped he was
                            saying that the Soviet Union would not be establishing a submarine base
                            at Cienfuegos. Vorontsov objected that he had not said that, nor had he
                            said that they would do so, but that in any case there were no grounds
                            for American objection or concern. I replied that the United States
                            would make its own determination of what constituted a cause for
                            concern, but that although Vorontsov chose to be vague, I still hoped
                            that he meant that the Soviet Union would not seek to establish such a
                            base. Vorontsov then said that the Soviet Government would “explain
                            fully” its position regarding developments at Cienfuegos “soon.” He,
                            Vorontsov, did not want to say more in advance of the Soviet
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>I call your attention to other items which are related: <list>
                                <item>—Since May Castro has repeatedly declared the right of Cuba to
                                    carry the fight to the territory of any country which lends
                                    itself to the exiles’ organization of invasions.</item>
                                <item>—If exiles are organizing in Central America they may be
                                    making a mistake in including Costa Rica President Figueres in
                                    their discussions, for reasons which you know about. If we
                                    should be supporting these exile plans, all the more so.</item>
                                <item>—We have wondered what the Cubans got out of agreeing to
                                    Soviet construction at Cienfuegos. Increased military assistance
                                    is probably part of the price. If Castro is worried about
                                    exiles, or if he wants some kind of capacity to project his own
                                    military strength, the Soviets may have decided to up their
                                    military aid accordingly. Exile activity in Central America
                                    might now be a convenient excuse for (a) Soviet aid, and (b)
                                    Cuban adventurism and retaliation.</item>
                                <item>—Alpha–66, a Miami-based group, has undertaken about three or
                                    four infiltration raids since May. All have been rolled up. The
                                    Agency denies they have anything to do with Alpha–66. The
                                    equipment reported captured by the Cubans when exiles were
                                    arrested include AR–18 rifles, cipher pads, and other items
                                    indicating some sophisticated support. <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                        >DOD</gloss> also has the capacity for clandestine support
                                    of such activity.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our approach to the Cuban sub-base problem seems to me to require a very
                            controlled precise approach. While in the abstract exile raids might
                            seem useful to give Castro trouble, they are also “unguided missiles.”
                            How would such raids fit into the total picture? Are we sure of the
                            reaction and its relation to other things? What do raids do by way of
                            projecting signals to the Soviets and the Cubans?</p>
                        <p>In sum, do we have any well-thought-out purpose for encouraging exiles?
                            Have we thought out the chess moves down the road? Shouldn't these be
                            very controlled? Should they be done now?</p>

                                    >footnote 2, Document 218</ref>.</note> during which he stated
                            that he would like to see me if at all possible that day. We agreed to
                            meet at 2:15 p.m. in the Map Room. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> greeted me by saying that he
                            had had two communications from the Soviet Government which had come
                            back with very great speed after our earlier conversation. He stated
                            that Moscow's hope had obviously been to reach me before our departure
                            for Europe but that it had been too late to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then handed me the two communications. The first dealt
                            with Jordan, the second with Cuba. With respect to Jordan, <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> added that the note was
                            somewhat dated but it should give us a good idea of the attitude of the
                            Soviet Government. The two communications read as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Jordan</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>“The Soviet Government has received with satisfaction President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s communication to the effect
                            that the United States do not contemplate any military actions in
                            connection with the events in Jordan and that the US Government is
                            exerting restraining influence in order to prevent interference in the
                            events in Jordan by other foreign states.</p>
                        <p>“From the very start of the events in Jordan the Soviet side, as the US
                            side has already been informed, has been taking steps aimed at bringing
                            about a speedy end to the fratricidal collisions in Jordan and at
                            preventing interference in the events therein by other states, both
                            belonging to that area and those outside of it. This, as the US
                            Government is aware, has produced certain results.</p>
                        <p>“The situation in Jordan still remains, however, rather complex.
                            Therefore, we proceed from the assumption that also in the time ahead
                            all states should exercise necessary prudence in their actions in order
                            not to aggravate the situation but, on the contrary, to help end the
                            conflict in Jordan.</p>
                        <p>“In Moscow it is believed that the most effective means of preventing
                            events like those which occurred in Jordan, is a speedy attainment of a
                            peaceful settlement in the Middle East as a whole.</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet position on questions pertaining to such settlement and, in
                            particular, on the question of contacts between the sides through
                                <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName> is well known to the
                            US Government.”</p>

                        <p>“The Soviet Government has received with attention President <persName

                            uncertainty which has appeared in <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670"
                                facs="0703"/>the President's mind in light of the understanding
                            reached in 1962 between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and US
                            Governments on the Cuban question.</p>
                        <p>“We noted with satisfaction the reaffirmation made by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in reply to our inquiry, that the
                            appropriate understanding reached at that time on the Cuban question
                            remains fully in force, that is, the United States as before will not
                            seek by the force of arms, through military means to change the existing
                            situation in Cuba. We also noted the reaffirmation made as regards the
                            United States's preventing such actions on the part of the Cuban
                            counter-revolutionary exiles.</p>
                        <p>“On our part, we have already stated to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and are ready to affirm it again
                            that in the Cuban question the Soviet Government continues to proceed
                            from the understanding reached on this question in 1962.</p>
                        <p>“The Soviet side has not done and is not doing in Cuba now—that includes
                            the area of the Cienfuegos port—anything of the kind that would
                            contradict that mentioned understanding.</p>
                        <p>“The American side is well aware of the negative attitude generally on
                            the part of the Soviet Union toward creating military bases by foreign
                            states on the territory of other states. Moreover, the Soviet Government
                            has introduced—both in the Committee on Disarmament and in the course of
                            the Soviet-American strategic arms limitation talks—a proposal to limit
                            the area of navigation for rocket-carrying submarines.</p>
                        <p>“In any case, we would like to reaffirm once more that the Soviet side
                            strictly adheres to its part of the understanding on the Cuban question
                            and will continue to adhere to it in the future on the assumption that
                            the American side as President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> has reaffirmed, will also strictly observe its
                            part of the understanding.</p>
                        <p>“I would like to draw your attention in connection with your remarks in
                            our last conversation to the sometimes asserted ‘right' for American
                            atomic submarines to enter the Black Sea. Such assertions are groundless
                            since the 1936 Convention on the status of the Black Sea Straits clearly
                            forbids submarines of non-coastal states to enter the Black Sea.”</p>
                        <p>After I had read the Cuban note, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> added that the Soviet Government would not be
                            able to make an agreement that Soviet submarines would never call at
                            Cuban ports but he was prepared to state that Soviet submarines would
                            not call there in an operational capacity. He could not say whether
                            there might not be one submarine in six months and another one in twelve
                            months. I told him that I considered this a forthright statement. I
                            stated that I was concerned, however, that there might be some ambiguity
                            about the meaning of the word “base” and, therefore, I thought it would
                            be very unfortunate if our two governments got into a major disagreement
                            over the issue of what actually constituted a base. Consequently, our
                            side <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0704"/>would have some clarifying
                            questions to ask the Soviet Government. At the very least we would have
                            to state our view of what constituted a base. The presence of the Soviet
                            ships, especially the tender and barges, at Cienfuegos, was clearly
                            inconsistent with the understanding. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would send on these
                            questions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then tried to
                            engage me in a discussion of the Middle East, specifically whether I
                            thought the Deputies in New York could make some progress in
                            negotiations. I told him that the Mideast negotiations probably had to
                            mark some time for the moment. He then asked whether I could provide
                            some advance information about the President's Vietnam speech.<note

                            that it was not finished yet. He asked whether I was worried that he

                            that this would not happen. I said I would not want to test your loyalty
                            to your allies in this manner, but that I would see whether I could get
                            him an advance copy of the President's remarks, perhaps by the next

                            obviously intended to be conciliatory. It clearly backs away from any
                            suggestion that the Soviets have a “right” to establish a base in Cuba,
                            which would have been the toughest response. Rather, it specifically
                            claims that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> traditionally
                            opposes foreign bases—thus establishing a presumption <pb n="672"
                                xml:id="pg_672" facs="0705"/>that they would not do so in Cuba (it
                            is worth recalling, however, that Khrushchev in September 1962 publicly
                            claimed that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> had no need to
                            “transfer” its strategic missiles to any foreign bases). The note also
                            goes to some length to pin down the understanding of 1962 and claims in
                            particular that their activities at Cienfuegos are consistent with that
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>This general line, plus other possible signs strongly suggests that the
                            Soviets are anxious to avoid a public (or private) confrontation: <list>
                                <item>—On the day following your press release, two of the Soviet
                                    vessels—the salvage and landing ship—that had been in Cienfuegos
                                    since September 9–10, departed for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                        >USSR</gloss>.</item>
                                <item>—Since then there has been virtually no change in Cienfuegos:
                                    no new construction, no significant increase in defense, no
                                    change in the use of the tender (it has apparently been at the
                                    pier since September 25–26, rather than moored at the deep
                                    basin, thought to be the submarine support area, guarded by the
                                    submarine nets).</item>
                                <item>—The Soviets have made only a minimal public acknowledgement
                                    (on September 30) and have tried to dismiss the affair as mere
                                    propaganda.</item>
                                <item>—The Soviet counselor (Vorontsov) told the UAR Ambassador in
                                    Washington that the Soviet activities were only Cuban port

                        </p>
                        <p>The general Soviet response thus suggests that they are looking for an
                            easy and quick end to the incident. This is consistent with the
                            interpretation that the main purpose of the exercise has been a probe of
                            our permissiveness, following on their earlier visits, especially the
                            one to Cienfuegos in May, which included a cruise missile submarine.
                            Having found that move has drawn a strong response, they probably want
                            to resolve it by taking refuge in the 1962 agreement. In this light, the
                            earlier conversation with Vorontsov was a form of reinsurance against
                            the current contingency, as well as sounding us out for any reaction to
                            what had already transpired in May and July.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the Soviet response is deliberately ambiguous, a retreat
                            but only a partial one. The note implies that, while an offensive or
                            strategic base is not involved at Cienfuegos, the facilities could still
                            be used from time to time in unspecified ways. Thus they are proposing a
                            narrow definition of the 1962 agreement. The consequence could be that
                            we might accept a de facto Soviet support base, limited only by the
                            exclusion of ballistic submarines.</p>

                                the acceptance of the current facilities at Cienfuegos, and perhaps

                        </list>
                        <p>This is a comprehensive examination of the significance of the Soviet
                            military force now deployed opposite China. Its major conclusions are as
                            follows: <list>
                                <item>—The 37 to 41 division force structure which the Soviets have
                                    developed opposite China now exceeds what would be required to
                                    repulse any foreseeable Chinese incursion.</item>
                                <item>—The present Soviet force could probably carry out large scale
                                    raids in the border regions of China but in view of their
                                    underdeveloped <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0710"/>service
                                    support structure they could probably not occupy and defend a
                                    significant amount of Chinese territory.</item>
                                <item>—With the divisions filled out to combat strength, a process
                                    which would take about three weeks, and provided with normal
                                    army and front level support, the Soviets would be capable of
                                    large scale offensive operations in the peripheral regions of
                                    China. Under these circumstances, the full strength Soviet force
                                    probably could seize and occupy sizable portions of territory,
                                    including Manchuria, the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, and the
                                    Dzungarian Basin in Sinkiang, using only conventional
                                    weapons.</item>
                                <item>—To date, there is no persuasive evidence of a Soviet intent
                                    to commit deliberate aggression against China. The forces now in
                                    being are not ready to undertake protracted large scale
                                    offensive operations. Were the Soviets planning to initiate a
                                    deliberate aggression, there would be a concerted effort to fill
                                    out existing understrength divisions and support units. In
                                    addition, some tactical missile units probably would be
                                    redeployed from other areas.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memorandum states that the
                            Soviets probably had several objectives in undertaking the buildup. One
                            objective, already realized, may have been to set the stage for
                            discussions on the border. The Soviets also probably calculated that a
                            credible land war threat near the China border will enhance their
                            ability to influence events in China after the death of Mao. In
                            addition, of course, the buildup has—from the Soviet viewpoint—put the
                            damper on any inclination the Chinese may have to launch military forays
                            against Soviet territory. From the standpoint of providing security for
                            Soviet territory, the forces near the China border are not excessive
                            when compared with Soviet forces located opposite other potential
                            enemies.</p>

                            <p>Since 1965 the Soviets have tripled their ground forces opposite
                                China. There are now some 37 to 41 Soviet ground force divisions <pb
                                    n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0711"/>deployed in the border
                                area, about 6 of which are fully combat ready. All of the others
                                have one or more subordinate regiments with sufficient strength to
                                undertake combat missions. About 210,000 troops are deployed with
                                these divisions, and nondivisional support elements bring the total
                                to about 335,000 men. The buildup is continuing.</p>
                            <p>In 1965, when the buildup was initiated, there were only 11 or 12
                                divisions in the border area, and only one of these was at combat
                                strength. All of the others were understrength and some were only
                                cadre divisions.</p>
                            <p>Over the same period tactical air forces have increased from a single
                                air army of 190 combat aircraft and about 40 helicopters deployed in
                                the Vladivostok area to at least 725 combat aircraft and 300
                                helicopters deployed along the entire border.</p>
                            <p>Soviet strategic air defenses in the border area also have been
                                improved in recent years, but most of this probably would have taken
                                place even if there had been no rift with China. Most of the new
                                missile and aircraft deployment probably results from a continuing
                                program to strengthen air defenses throughout the <gloss

                            <p>Three operational units of the 500 nautical mile Scaleboard
                                surface-to-surface missile system—the only confirmed units in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>—have been deployed near
                                the border since 1967.</p>
                            <p>Strategic ballistic missile and bomber forces have not undergone any
                                major changes that can be attributed to the confrontation with
                                China, other than some command and control adjustments.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet ground and tactical air forces in the border area are
                                deployed in two essentially separate operational theaters. Most of
                                these forces—29 to 33 divisions and nearly 700 aircraft—are located
                                opposite northeast China in the Trans-Baikal and the Far East
                                Military Districts and in Mongolia. The other 8 divisions and about
                                35 aircraft are deployed in the newly formed Central Asian Military
                                District opposite Sinkiang.</p>
                            <p>There are, in addition, 4 divisions in the Siberian Military District
                                and 6 in the Turkestan Military District which probably are
                                available as reinforcements for the border area. These are located
                                in remote areas, and except for an airborne division in Turkestan,
                                all are at low strength. Only one, a cadre division moved into the
                                Siberian Military District in 1969, has undergone any change since
                                the buildup began in 1965. These divisions are not believed to be
                                currently available for early commitment.</p>
                            <p>Other reinforcements could be obtained by redeploying divisions from
                                the western military districts. Depending on the readiness level of
                                the divisions to be moved and the distance to be traveled, divisions
                                could begin arriving in the border area 10 to 17 days after the
                                Soviets decided to reinforce.</p>
                            <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0712"/>
                            <p>The 37 to 41 division force structure which the Soviets have
                                developed opposite China now exceeds what would be required to
                                repulse any foreseeable Chinese incursion. The present force could
                                probably also carry out large scale raids in the border regions of
                                China, but in view of their underdeveloped service support structure
                                they could probably not occupy and defend a significant amount of
                                Chinese territory.</p>
                            <p>With the divisions filled out to combat strength, however, and
                                provided with normal army and front level support, the Soviets would
                                be capable of large scale offensive operations for objectives in the
                                peripheral regions of China. Such a force would have about 570,000
                                troops, 8,200 tanks, at least 5,400 conventional artillery pieces,
                                and some 250 missile and rocket launchers for direct nuclear
                                support.</p>
                            <p>With their present air forces the Soviets probably could quickly
                                establish air superiority in the peripheral regions of China. This
                                would enable them to provide massive support to the ground forces
                                with tactical air and medium bomber forces.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, the full strength Soviet force probably
                                could seize and occupy sizable portions of territory, including
                                Manchuria, the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, and the Dzungarian
                                Basin in Sinkiang, using only conventional weapons. The Soviets
                                would probably refrain from the use of tactical nuclear weapons
                                unless it appeared necessary for the achievement of their military
                                objectives.</p>
                            <p>To date, however, there is no persuasive evidence of a Soviet intent
                                to commit deliberate aggression against China. The forces now in
                                being are not ready to undertake protracted large scale offensive
                                operations. Were the Soviets planning to initiate a deliberate
                                aggression there would be a concerted effort to fill out existing
                                understrength divisions and nondivisional support units such as
                                artillery, engineer, ponton bridge, and assault crossing units. In
                                addition, some tactical missile units probably would be redeployed
                                from other areas. There would also be a heavy influx of trucks to
                                provide both divisional and rear service motor transport.</p>
                            <p>To bring the forces in the border area to full combat readiness,
                                reservists and civilian trucks would have to be transported from
                                centers in the central and western <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> to supplement those obtained from local
                                mobilization. The Soviets have the resources and transportation
                                facilities to accomplish this in about three weeks.</p>
                            <p>The availability of stocks of ammunition, POL, and general supplies
                                in the border area is not known. Because the forces opposite China
                                are located at the end of long and, in some areas, vulnerable supply
                                lines, the Soviets probably have made some effort to develop their
                                logistical base in the area. If the current rate of military traffic
                                on the Trans-Siberian Railroad has been maintained throughout the
                                force <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0713"/>buildup, the Soviets
                                could have provided the troops now in place with stocks of
                                ammunition and POL sufficient for 90 days of combat. Unless it is
                                interdicted, the Trans-Siberian Railroad has ample excess capacity
                                to supply the daily tonnage of supplies needed to support the
                                present force in combat without seriously reducing civilian
                                traffic.</p>
                            <p>The fact that the force is still not fully combat ready after five
                                years of buildup suggests that the immediate objective of the Soviet
                                buildup was not to initiate hostilities against the Chinese. The
                                pace of the buildup may have been limited by a Soviet desire to
                                avoid drawing down forces opposite <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> or straining the civilian economy.</p>
                            <p>The personnel and equipment strengths of the developing divisions in
                                the border area continue to increase gradually. Some divisions
                                probably will reach combat readiness during the next year or so.
                                Others may stabilize at less than combat strength. This would be
                                consistent with the manner in which the Soviets have structured
                                their forces in the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> intended
                                for use against <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, where only
                                about one-third of the divisions are kept at combat readiness during
                                peacetime.</p>
                            <p>If the Soviets should follow this practice with the forces in the
                                border area, it would suggest that they believe that the time it
                                would take the relatively immobile Chinese forces to mount a serious
                                threat would permit the Soviet forces in the border area to be
                                filled out with reservists and mobilized civilian trucks.</p>
                            <p>Conversely, if the Soviets continue working to bring all the forces
                                to full combat readiness, it would indicate that they believe a
                                large scale conflict could break out suddenly with little warning.
                                This would reflect a more serious view of the Chinese threat than is
                                now apparent, or it could mean that they were contemplating the
                                initiation of offensive action themselves.</p>
                            <p>The Soviets probably had several objectives in undertaking the
                                military buildup opposite China. One objective—already realized—may
                                have been to set the stage for the Sino-Soviet discussions on border
                                issues. The Soviets probably calculate that the possession of a
                                credible land war threat near the China border will enhance their
                                ability to influence events in China after the death of Mao. In
                                addition, of course, the buildup has—from the Soviet viewpoint—put
                                the damper on any inclination the Chinese may have to launch
                                military forays against Soviet territory. From the standpoint of
                                providing security for Soviet territory, the forces near the China
                                border are not excessive when compared with Soviet forces located
                                opposite other potential enemies.</p>
                            <p>The pattern of the buildup to date suggests that the Soviets are
                                developing a force structure of at least 3 and possibly 4 army
                                groups (potential fronts)—two or three opposite Manchuria and one
                                opposite Sinkiang. This would imply a force of 42 to 48 divisions
                                and 900 to 1,000 aircraft. At full strength, this force would have
                                about 780,000 <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0714"/>troops. Such
                                a force would probably still not enable the Soviets to carry a
                                conventional land war against China beyond the peripheral regions.
                                It would, however, provide the Soviets with a capability to respond
                                to the initiation of hostilities on a level of their own choosing,
                                up to and including an attack to seize and hold indefinitely the
                                most important peripheral regions of China such as Manchuria, Inner
                                Mongolia, or large parts of Sinkiang.</p>

                        <p>The meeting was initialed at my request and began with my handing
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> a copy of an oral
                                note<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">Printed at Tab A.</note> dealing
                            with the installations in Cuba. The purpose of the note was to tie down
                            our understanding of the Soviet base. Rather than putting the issues in
                            the form of questions they were phrased in the form of an understanding
                            of what we considered a base.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then read over
                            the note (Tab A) and said that the only point that seemed bothersome was
                            the point about “communica-facilities,” but he would have to await
                            further instructions from Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> added that
                            Tass would soon publish a statement repeating in effect the content of
                            the oral note of October 6<note n="3" xml:id="d228fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d224">Document 224</ref>.</note> denying any Soviet
                            intent to establish a base in Cuba. I said that we would judge it by the
                            criteria of our oral note. Later in the evening <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called to inquire whether the
                            point about repair facilities <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0715"
                            />applied to all Soviet ships or only those capable of offensive action.
                            I replied that it applied to the ships described in the note.</p>
                        <p>We then discussed the possibility of a meeting between Soviet Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and the
                            President. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            asked whether it should take place before or after the Foreign Ministers
                            meetings with Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName>. I replied that my instincts suggested that the
                            meeting should take place afterwards. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then asked what date was
                            convenient and I suggested the afternoon of October 23rd following the
                            President's speech at the UN. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said that this was in general acceptable. I
                            then told the Ambassador to make sure that during these conversations no
                            mention would be made of the US–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            Summit meeting or, in any event, to be sure that I received advance word
                            in order to provide me with an opportunity to put the issue into formal
                            channels. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            agreed and further agreed to come to Washington before the meeting of
                            the President and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1"
                                >Gromyko</persName> so that we could coordinate on and agree to the
                            agenda.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then turned to
                            a general discussion of US-Soviet relations. He said it was hard to
                            exaggerate the concern of his leadership in Moscow. Their feeling was
                            that the United States had already decided to adopt a hard line and it
                            was whipping up a propaganda campaign in order to get larger defense
                            budgets and perhaps affect the election. He said that the campaign on
                            the Mideast was out of all proportion to the provocation. He called my
                            attention to the fact that the Soviet Union had never been part of the
                            cease-fire. He said that when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> first told him about the cease-fire standstill in
                            conjunction with the US proposal for Middle East Peace negotiations,
                            that he had asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> whether these items were linked together.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> had replied that
                            it was desirable “but not” indispensable that the cease-fire and the
                            negotiations be linked together. The Ambassador stated that, therefore,
                            the Soviet Government did not understand why the U.S. suddenly decided
                            to effect a linkage. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> then said that Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, in the presence of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>, had told him there
                            was no linkage between these elements and that, in any event, the Soviet
                            Union had only been informed of our understanding of the cease-fire for
                            informational purposes. The Ambassador added that the Soviet Government
                            was seriously debating whether to start a press campaign against us
                            along similar lines.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he
                            hoped that the U.S. Government did not draw the conclusion from the
                            Middle East crisis that the Soviet Union could be intimidated by a show
                            of United States force. He asked whether we really thought that one
                            additional U.S. carrier in the Eastern Mediterranean would make the
                            Soviet Union back down. <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0716"
                            />Further, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            stated he could understand that the United States might claim for
                            propaganda purposes that the Soviet Union controlled the Syrians but
                            that if we really believed that to be the case then we were in bad
                            shape. He continued that if the Soviet Union acted when its national
                            interest was involved then it would act with great force and it would be
                            hard to dissuade them. I replied that we were not children, that we
                            looked at the situation with great care. Having observed Soviet military
                            actions in the last decade and a half we knew that when the Soviet Union
                            used its forces it did so massively. But that was not the point. The
                            point was that we were asking the same questions about the Soviet
                            leaders that he allegedly was asking about our leaders. I reminded him
                            that we had offered a Summit meeting on two occasions during the summer
                            without ever receiving a formal reply. In response there was the massive
                            move forward of Egyptian and Soviet missiles along the canal and the
                            massive deception in Cuba. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> began to explain that the Cuban situation was
                            “not clear.” I interrupted saying if there is to be any sense in our
                            meetings we must not kid one another. I added, “you know what is there
                            and I know what is there even though we may not say it, so let us not
                            discuss it any further.”</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Egyptian missiles, Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> called my attention to the
                            phrase that there were no Soviet personnel with the missiles in Egypt. I
                            said that perhaps he meant “military” personnel and that they had put
                            them into civilian clothes. He replied that the phrase was intended to
                            mean that there were no Soviet personnel.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then appeared
                            to bluster stating that the Soviet Union had a lot of experience in
                            dealing with Americans and they thought their system was more permanent
                            than ours and therefore if things came to that point they would wait for
                            6 years until President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> was
                            out of office. I replied that perhaps the inference that the press
                            campaign came from us was started by people who did not know anything
                            about American affairs. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1"
                                >Dobrynin</persName> said “no” it was the consensus of all their
                            senior officials that relations with the United States had never been
                            worse since the Cuban missile crisis. I said that I could only repeat
                            what I had said to him previously. We were at a turning point. We
                            recognized very well that neither side could gain anything in an arms
                            race but if present trends continued they would force us into an
                            enlarged military budget. He might well tell me that his leaders could
                            wait six years and this might be true; however, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> did not become President by not
                            being persistent. Nevertheless, it did not seem sensible to exchange
                            protestations on the issue of greater endurance. The problem was how to
                            turn this present impasse into a more fruitful direction and, therefore,
                            to turn our attention to that.</p>
                        <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0717"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that it
                            was important to discuss the Middle East and related issues. I replied
                            again that this was not the time to do it. But that if they were ever
                            willing to take up our offer for serious bilateral talks between
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and me we
                            would make every effort to proceed. The Ambassador told me that the
                            memorandum he had handed to me, which is attached at Tab B, was written
                            only for the President and would receive no publicity and be referred to
                            nowhere else.</p>

                            <p>The President appreciated the forthright reply of the Soviet
                                Government conveying the affirmation of your government that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is not and will not
                                construct any facility in Cuba that will violate the understanding
                                of 1962 between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and US
                                Governments on the Cuban questions. The clarification of this
                                situation can be a significant contribution to improving US-Soviet
                                relations.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the Soviet Government
                                with what we understand by the phrase: “The Soviet side has not done
                                and is not doing in Cuba now—that includes the area of the
                                Cienfuegos port—anything of the kind that would contradict the
                                mentioned understanding.”</p>
                            <p>The US Government understands that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> will not establish, utilize, or permit the
                                establishment of any facility in Cuba that can be employed to
                                support or repair Soviet naval ships capable of carrying offensive
                                weapons; i.e., submarines or surface ships armed with
                                nuclear-capable, surface-to-surface missiles. The US Government
                                further understands that the following specific actions will not be
                                undertaken: <list>
                                    <item>—Construction of facilities for the handling and storing

                                        therefrom.</item>
                                    <item>—Construction of submarine or surface ship repair
                                        facilities ashore in Cuba.</item>
                                    <item>—Basing or extended deployment of tenders or other repair
                                        ships in Cuban ports that are capable of supporting or

                            <p>Finally, the President wishes to emphasize that the U.S. Government
                                will observe strictly its part of the 1962 understanding as long as
                                the Soviet Union does the same.</p>

                            <p>The attention of the Soviet leadership has been attracted to the
                                campaign, hostile to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>,
                                being waged in the US around so-called “violations of the terms of
                                the cease-fire” in the Suez canal zone and the Soviet Union's
                                alleged involvement in those “violations”.</p>
                            <p>This anti-Soviet campaign is clearly being encouraged, and, to say
                                more frankly, in fact inspired by American officials. How else can
                                one judge, for example, the statement made by the Assistant
                                Secretary of State Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
                                at the press briefing in Chicago on September 16 when he, while
                                accusing the UAR without proof of having violated the cease-fire
                                terms, alleged in addition that all “these violations could not have
                                taken place without the knowledge and the complicity of the Soviet
                                Union”. Speaking at the same briefing Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> also permitted himself to
                                make remarks about violations of the cease-fire “by the Egyptians
                                and the Russians”. Moreover, and again with the blessing of
                                officials, the theme was launched professing some general
                                “credibility gap” with regard to the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>Clearly, in this connection the Soviet leadership cannot but raise
                                the question as to what all this is being done for? What is the aim
                                of the US Government in all of this? Because who else is better
                                aware than the American Government of the complete lack of ground
                                for the assertions that the Soviet Government had something to do
                                with reaching the agreement on the terms of the cease-fire in the
                                Suez Canal zone, still less—with some kind of “violations” of such
                                agreement.</p>
                            <p>It is worthwhile to recall some facts pertaining to this question. On
                                August 8, i.e. on the day when the cease-fire in the Suez Canal zone
                                entered into force, the US Ambassador in Moscow, while handing to
                                    <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0719"/>the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Foreign Ministry the text of the
                                terms of that cease-fire, already agreed upon with the Governments
                                of the UAR and Israel, clearly and unequivocally stated that this
                                was being done only “for the information of the Soviet Government”.
                                On August 11 transmitting to the Ministry some additional details of
                                the terms of cease-fire, the US Ambassador said again that those
                                clarifications had already been discussed by the US Government with
                                the Governments of the UAR and Israel and that they were being
                                handed to the Soviet side “just for its information”.</p>
                            <p>That is how the record stands regarding involvement or, rather,
                                non-involvement of the Soviet Union in the agreement itself on the
                                terms of cease-fire in the Suez Canal zone.</p>
                            <p>On what basis, then, did the American side start later to present the
                                matter in such a way as if there were some terms of cease-fire in
                                the Suez Canal zone agreed upon between the US and <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Governments? We have already
                                drawn the attention of the US Government, through the American
                                Ambassador in Moscow, in particular in the conversation with him
                                held at the Foreign Ministry on September 15, to the fact that this
                                kind of presentation was groundless. Nevertheless, US officials
                                continued to distort the actual state of the matter.</p>
                            <p>Now about so-called “violations” of this agreement. It is necessary
                                first of all to emphasize the complete lack of foundation for the
                                attempts being made in the United States to prove that the Soviet
                                side had something to do with such “violations”. This refers, in
                                particular, to statements alleging deployment in the Suez Canal zone
                                of new rocket-launchers manned by Soviet personnel after August 8.
                                That is deliberately false. Contrary to the assertions by American
                                officials, there have not been and there are not now
                                rocket-launchers manned by Soviet personnel in the Suez Canal
                                zone.</p>
                            <p>What leaps into one's eye is that the American side while so
                                unsparingly accusing the UAR of “violating” the terms of cease-fire,
                                keeps almost complete silence with regard to actual violations made
                                by Israel from the very first day of the cease-fire. Moreover,
                                spokesmen of the US Government deem it appropriate to speak directly
                                about “utmost importance for Israel to retain air superiority in the
                                Suez Canal zone”, as well as about “manoeuvrability and freedom of
                                action in that area”. Such a position hardly serves as a proof of US
                                “impartiality”. It can only mean one thing—a desire to mislead
                                public opinion by presenting a distorted picture of the state of
                                things and whitewashing the aggressor. All this is actually nothing
                                but encouragement by the United States of a stubbornly
                                obstructionist tactics of Israel, which from the very beginning and
                                until this day has been rejecting contacts and negotiations through
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, raising
                                all sorts of far-fetched pretexts. Among them are accusations
                                against the UAR of “violating” the terms of cease-fire. These
                                assertions have already been refuted in <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687"
                                    facs="0720"/>an official statement made to the US representative
                                in Cairo by the UAR Minister of Foreign Affairs <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RM8">M. Riad</persName> and also in <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RM8">M. Riad</persName>'s Cairo TV address on
                                October 6, 1970.</p>
                            <p>It should also be noted that Israel is now trying in every way to
                                complicate and confuse the very question of cease-fire. One should
                                recall that in American proposals of June 19 themselves negotiations
                                between the sides through <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> were not organicly linked to the cease-fire.
                                That was publicly acknowledged by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1"
                                    >Sisco</persName>, who said in Chicago on September 16 that
                                “originally the American proposals did not envisage any direct link
                                between cease-fire and start of the talks”.</p>
                            <p>However after the UAR Government accepted the American proposal on
                                cease-fire, having thus displayed its full readiness to negotiate
                                through <persName corresp="#p_JGV1">Jarring</persName>, Israel
                                started inventing new pretexts to dodge from such negotiations.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Union has always been a sincere supporter of cease-fire,
                                viewing it also as an important factor in creating a more favourable
                                climate for talks between the sides. However the Soviet Union cannot
                                ignore the attempts to deliberately complicate the question of
                                cease-fire in order to torpedo the negotiations as is being done by
                                Israel with the US support.</p>
                            <p>It could not but be noted in Moscow that supporting the
                                obstructionist position of Israel the US Government itself also
                                undertakes steps which lead to aggravation of the situation in the
                                Middle East area. In this connection one should mention for instance
                                the uproar created around the visit by the US President to the
                                American 6th fleet in the Mediterranean. Among acts of this nature
                                are the new deliveries of “Phantom” fighter-bombers and of other
                                weapons to Israel and the reconnaissance flights by American
                                aircraft over the territory of the UAR, a sovereign state, in gross
                                violation of the norms of international law.</p>
                            <p>All this cannot but raise a legitimate question: where in effect is
                                the United States leading to in the Middle East?</p>
                            <p>On our part we should like to reaffirm that the Soviet Government has
                                been and remains a firm supporter of speedy achievement of a
                                political settlement in the Middle East, of establishment of a
                                durable and just peace there, on the basis of the well known
                                resolution of the Security Council, in all its parts.</p>
                            <p>We believe that every effort should be made in order not to lose the
                                opportunity for progress in political settlement in the Middle East
                                which is being created by the agreement of the Arab states to
                                negotiate through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JGV1"
                                    >Jarring</persName> and the actually existing state of
                                cease-fire. We are ready to contribute to that both within the
                                framework of our bilateral meetings and at the four-power
                                consultations.</p>
                            <p>As for the talk about so-called “crisis of confidence” in general,
                                the unseriousness of US officials' approach to this matter has
                                attracted <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0721"/>attention in
                                Moscow. All those groundless statements indeed give reason to ask:
                                is the US Government ready to support by its deeds what it says in
                                the course of exchange of opinion with the Soviet Government or are
                                those words said because of some considerations of the moment. The
                                US position on the Middle East question and the distortion by the
                                American side of facts pertaining to the cease-fire in the Suez
                                Canal zone, indeed, cannot contribute to the strengthening of mutual
                                understanding and trust in relations between our countries so needed
                                for a fruitful development of these very relations.</p>
