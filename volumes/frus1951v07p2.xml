                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    Government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                    Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>

                        <item>To avoid publication of matters which would tend to impede current
                            diplomatic negotiations or other business.</item>

                        <item>To condense the record and avoid repetition of needless
                            details.</item>

                        <item>To preserve the confidence reposed in the Department by individuals

                            upon by the Department. To this consideration there is one
                            qualification—in connection with major decisions it is desirable, where
                            possible, to show the alternative presented to the Department before the
                            decision was made.</item>

                <p>Documents selected for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes are referred to the Department of State
                    Classification/Declassification Center for declassification clearance. The
                    Center reviews the documents, makes declassification decisions, and obtains the
                    clearance of geographic and functional bureaus of the Department of State, as
                    well as of other appropriate agencies of the government. The Center, in
                    coordination <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"/>with the geographic bureaus
                    of the Department of State, conducts communications with foreign governments
                    regarding documents or information of those governments proposed for inclusion
                    in <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes.</p>
                <p>Until his retirement in 1979, Deputy Historian Fredrick Aandahl directed the
                    entire <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> project, including the
                    preparation of this volume. John P. Glennon supervised the process of review,
                    declassification, and final editing.</p>
                <p>The section on Korea was compiled by Mr. Glennon, the section on policy with
                    regard to China by Harriet D. Schwar, and that on trade restrictions and
                    economic sanctions against China and North Korea by Paul Claussen. Technical
                    editing was performed by Margie R. Wilber and by Joann G. Alba, under Mrs.
                    Wilber’s supervision, in the Publishing Services Division (Paul M. Washington,
                    Chief). Anne K. Pond prepared the index.</p>

                                island may be used by the United States or the Chinese Nationalists

                                required. Moreover, it must be recognized that Formosa is
                                geographically a portion of the off-shore island chain and would be
                                essential in the conduct of air and naval operations in the

                                        have no present intention of basing any United States forces
                                        on Formosa except as may become necessary to comply with the
                                        President’s directive of 27 June 1950. However, if a full
                                        scale war should develop against Communist China, or against
                                        the USSR with Communist China as a Soviet ally, it would be
                                        desirable to have port facilities and airfields on Formosa
                                        available to the United States.</item>
                                    <item>We do not envisage an invasion of China by United States
                                        Troops even in the event of a full scale war. However, the
                                        Nationalist forces on Formosa constitute the only visible
                                        source of manpower for extensive guerrilla operations in
                                        China and a possible invasion of the mainland. Hence, until
                                        a solution is found for our major differences with Communist
                                        China, we should continue to safeguard Formosa.</item>

                                        forces to insure that they are met?</item>

                                        <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The United States should be

                                        employment of naval and air forces to safeguard Formosa.
                                        This would insure that the United States retains freedom of
                                        action for the utilization of Formosa as a base of
                                        operations for the Chinese Nationalist forces, as well as

                                        commitment might hamper sound military decisions in the

                            China; second, to get such information as to the internal situation on
                            the Chinese mainland as Third Party was able to give and as might be
                            useful to the United States; third, to get Third Party’s advice as to
                            the conduct of United States policy to forward a schism between China
                            and the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed also that First Party’s identity should not be disclosed to
                            Third Party but that he should be described as someone close to the
                            center and knowledgeable about United States foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>First Party emphasized the need to make clear to Third Party that he was
                            not speaking as someone able to commit the United States Government in
                            any way. First Party emphasized that no one could commit this government
                            to a particular response to a hypothetical development. He added that
                            from the general nature of United States policy and from the particular
                            implications of the United States position, however, it was possible to
                            draw certain conclusions that would probably stand up under the test of
                            future events.</p>
                        <p>First Party then proceeded with a presentation of United States policy
                            along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>The present crisis in world relations stems from a long historic
                            development. In the past four or five centuries two general developments
                            have been taking place.</p>
                        <p>The first began with the expansion westward out of Western Europe. That
                            expansion included within its scope Africa, the two Americas, the
                            southern and in part the eastern fringes of Asia, and in part the Middle
                            East. Its course has been uneven but generally in the following
                            sequence: discovery, exploration, conquest, colonization, development,
                            independence, and cooperation. Its imperialist phases are as well known
                            to the American consciousness as to that of Oriental peoples. The
                            tradition of freedom and cooperation among nations represented by the
                            side of the issue for which the United States stands has been admittedly
                            uneven. Yet the fact is that the United States and its Western Allies
                            today are not exponents of imperialism and exploitation. The record of
                            the past decade certainly verifies this. In seeking liberation from
                            western imperialism the Oriental peoples are contending against
                            something that isn’t there any more.</p>
                        <p>The other great development began roughly 350 years ago. It is the
                            expansion from eastern Europe. It has produced the great span of Russian
                            power in the present world. The cardinal fact of the eastern expansion
                            has been that the Russians have not developed any mode for the conduct
                            of affairs except that of domination. The westward movement did evolve
                            through a difficult course toward freedom and equality. The eastward
                            expansion has never done so.</p>
                        <p>In the present phase the characteristics of the eastward expansion <pb
                                n="1478" xml:id="pg_1478" facs="0020"/>are vastly aggravated by the
                            circumstance that Russia is now in the vise of a small group of
                            limitless ambition, ruthlessness, and an ideology that brooks no rival
                            system of thought. The Soviet system represents imperialism. It is out
                            for conquest and subordination of other peoples. It is armed with an
                            imperialist ideology. Its ideas devour all other ideas just as its power
                            system absorbs and subordinates other peoples. The subtle danger of the
                            combination of Russian power and the communist idea is that it enables
                            the Russians to perpetrate conquest by dissimulation. Imperialism is
                            carried on in the name of liberation. Tyranny is carried on for the
                            ostensible sake of its actual victims.</p>
                        <p>As a result of historical developments, climaxed in two great wars, the
                            Soviet Union<note n="3" xml:id="d2fn3">For documentation on U.S. policy
                                with regard to the Soviet Union, see volume <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >iv</hi>.</note> and the United States have emerged as the
                            leaders of two groups of nations. Power has become polarized between
                            them. The ideas represented by the two systems make reconciliation
                            impossible.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet system aims at the subjugation of every other idea, every
                            other people, every other culture. Obviously its primary enemy is the
                            United States. This does not mean that the United States is necessarily
                            next in the order of attack. It is certainly highest in the order of
                            importance because it is the greatest power unit ranged against the
                            Soviet Union. We identify the Soviet Union as our mortal enemy. To us
                            that is the most important consideration in the world picture. The
                            hostile intention of the Soviet Union toward us and toward all other
                            peoples gives us something in common with all other peoples and nations
                            and governments which are the targets of Soviet conquest. All such
                            peoples should be on our side in the struggle. If the inherent identity
                            of interest were made clear, all peoples would be. The trouble is that
                            the true issues are obscured by shibboleths and false issues.</p>
                        <p>This leads to the tragic aspect of the China situation. The Chinese under
                            Peiping are being inveigled into supporting the side which is against
                            their own interests. It is manifest that a world victory for the
                            Kremlin, whether through world war or through conquest without world
                            war, would produce a situation in which Chinese freedom would vanish.
                            China would be tied to the Kremlin chariot. Yet the Chinese seem to be
                            missing this point in their preoccupation with secondary and obsolete
                            issues.</p>
                        <p>The common interests vis-à-vis the Kremlin of all peoples seeking to
                            maintain their independence should be paramount over every other
                            consideration. The United States would like to make it so. To our view,
                                <pb n="1479" xml:id="pg_1479" facs="0021"/>a basis of accommodation
                            can be found with any other nation which is acting only in its own
                            interest. On the other hand, there is no basis of accommodation between
                            the United States and a government which serves not its own interests
                            but the interest of our mortal enemy. The crux of the question is
                            whether Peiping looks at things through Moscow’s eyes. This is not a
                            question of the attitude of those in the Peiping régime who are not
                            themselves minions of Moscow. It is a question of the motives of those
                            who are in the determining positions of Peiping.</p>
                        <p>The touchstone is Korea. The United States sent forces into Korea in
                            keeping with the ideas of the United Nations Charter. These ideas stand
                            in complete contrast to the Kremlin’s purpose of subjugating other
                            peoples. They were put to test by a clear case of the movement of forces
                            across a boundary. Had the United States, which had forces near at hand,
                            not sought to thwart the aggression, the idea of nations standing
                            together against the power which seeks to subjugate them would have been
                            made a mockery. The United States’ action—the UN action, that is—was in
                            the interest of all peoples who wish to be independent. Our action was
                            not aimed at the independence of Korea. We coveted no territory there.
                            We had withdrawn from it. We were perfectly sincere in saying it was
                            beyond our strategic concern. Not direct strategic interest but our
                            interest in upholding the idea which our enemy would destroy—the
                            independence of nations—drew us back into Korea. Our intention was to
                            repel the aggression, establish a sound basis for Korean independence,
                            and then get out. In this we would have succeeded, except for outside
                            intervention. That means Peiping intervention.</p>
                        <p>That intervention has brought great dismay to the American people. In our
                            view, the right of peoples in the Far East to live independently of the
                            threat of outside aggression is in the interest of China—not just of the
                            Republic of Korea alone. Yet Chinese forces have moved in against our
                            forces. The Peiping régime has set itself up to defeat the idea of
                            collective security. It has taken hostile action against United States
                            forces and other U.N. forces. It has set itself athwart the purposes of
                            the UN. It has precipitated a situation all too likely to lead to a
                            tragic war between the Chinese and ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The Peiping action certainly was not dictated by any interest of the
                            Chinese people. It was in the interest of only one power—not China, but
                            Russia. It is obviously only in the interest of Russia that the United
                            States and China should go into war. For the immediate contenders such
                            war could only be tragic.</p>
                        <p>The United States has desisted from countering against the Chinese
                            mainland in the realization that Moscow alone would be served by such a
                            war. This restraint has not been pleasant for Americans. If we <pb
                                n="1480" xml:id="pg_1480" facs="0022"/>followed the dictates of our
                            emotions we would take naval and air action against the Chinese on the
                            mainland. We would lay waste their cities and destroy their industries.
                            We would let the Chinese people know the terrible potential consequences
                            of the irresponsible actions taken by the men in power in their
                            government. Reason alone dictates this restraint. We deny ourselves the
                            retribution because our reason tells us that the Chinese are the
                            unwitting and deceived victims of Moscow, that carrying the war into
                            China would only deflect us from the real villain, our primary enemy,
                            Moscow. We are actuated also by the hope that something may occur to
                            bring China to its senses so that it will cease to serve the interests
                            of conspiracy that is aimed against Chinese independence just as much as
                            ours—and in the present situation more imminently so.</p>
                        <p>If war comes, and China is still acting in Moscow’s interest, China could
                            certainly count on no immunity from our wrath. Our survival would be at
                            stake. We would have to use our power against all those who use theirs
                            against us. The consequences for China would be terrible, of course. We
                            would undertake the course with great regret that blindness in Peiping
                            had led to a tragedy for a people with whom we have had a traditional
                            friendship. But such regrets would not inhibit our action. We would view
                            the situation from the standpoint of cold necessity.</p>
                        <p>Second Party raised a point which Third Party had told him entered into
                            the thinking of those dominant in Peiping. It was this: the United
                            States now has its hands full in its preoccupation with the danger from
                            the Soviet Union itself. In war the United States would be fully
                            occupied with Russia. This circumstance would provide Peiping with
                            impunity.</p>
                        <p>First Party said the United States Government believed it would win the
                            war, if one should eventuate. The ordeal would be great. Both sides
                            would suffer terrible wounds. But the United States would emerge victor.
                            It could not be counted on to forget old scores under the moderating
                            effect of victory. It would, to the contrary, settle all unbalanced
                            accounts. If the Chinese themselves had not settled the account with
                            respect to Korea, the United States certainly would then. It is better
                            that the Chinese settle the score themselves. Certainly there is an
                            account to be settled between a people and its leaders who forced them
                            into enormous dangers in the interest of another power. This was done
                            recklessly and deceptively and in total disregard of the interests of
                            the Chinese. It is better that the Chinese settle that account while
                            there is still time for the settlement to be effective in deterring a
                            war.</p>
                        <p>First Party commented that the immediate future of the issue regarding
                            Korea was unclear. We had operated in Korea under the UN aegis. Now it
                            was becoming apparent that the UN had great trepidation <pb n="1481"
                                xml:id="pg_1481" facs="0023"/>about drawing the issue with the
                            Chinese. What would the United States do? It might clear its accounts
                            for the time being under the premise that the whole action was a UN
                            action and that the United States would conform to the limits allowable
                            under UN endorsement. It might cut loose from the UN aegis. After all,
                            the bulk of the attrition suffered had been on the part of Americans on
                            the UN side (Koreans excepted). Our Army was the one that got jumped.
                            Other nations had committed only small fractions. For the time being the
                            first course might be followed out of expediency. But the Chinese should
                            not assume that the debt would be wiped off that way.</p>
                        <p>The discussion then went on to the Formosa problem.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the Cairo declaration<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4"
                                >Reference is to the communiqué issued by President Franklin D.
                                Roosevelt, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and Prime Minister Winston
                                Churchill following their conference at Cairo, November 22–26, 1943.
                                The relevant portion declared that “all the territories Japan has

                            valid. In our view the island should go to China eventually. Certainly
                            we did not claim it for ourselves and would not do so. Our interposition
                            of the 7th fleet in the channel there was motivated by one consideration
                            only. We did not wish the position to be used against us. Our action in
                            Korea made this necessary. As one of the victor powers we have residual
                            rights there until a Japanese peace treaty has been made. The Cairo
                            declaration manifested our intention. It did not itself constitute a
                            cession of territory. We had been compelled to act because of our fear
                            of a stab in the back from Peiping. We would be willing to see the
                            island go to any Chinese régime not likely to use it against us. That
                            brings up the question again: Is the Chinese régime the servant of its
                            people’s interests or the servant of Moscow’s interests? If the régime
                            is acting only in China’s interest, Formosa is a solvable problem. If it
                            is acting in the interest of Moscow—as it certainly appears to be—it
                            would be quixotic in the extreme for the United States to permit the
                            island to go forthwith to Peiping.</p>
                        <p>It is futile and academic to consider any issues between the United
                            States and the Chinese apart from the main problem of Peiping’s
                            intentions. This applied to the question of recognition.</p>
                        <p>The United States conducts its recognition policy in its own interest as
                            it sees it. Our continued recognition of Chiang Kai-shek’s<note n="5"

                            or any determination to impose it in authority over the mainland. Those
                            in the United States who speak up vehemently for him are in a distinct
                            minority.</p>
                        <p>To suspend relations with a relict régime naturally brings into immediate
                                <pb n="1482" xml:id="pg_1482" facs="0024"/>focus the question of
                            dealing with the successor régime. A way of avoiding technically the
                            question of dealing with a new régime is to continue to maintain
                            relations with the relict. We had done this in China. The situation is
                            not particularly to our liking. We would prefer to deal with a
                            responsible government in an effective position. The key word is <hi
                                rend="italic">responsible</hi>. Is Peiping responsible to the
                            Chinese people or is it actually responsive to Moscow?</p>
                        <p>Recognition is a way of doing business. It has no usefulness per se. The
                            rub is that you cannot do business with a régime that has lost its power
                            to transact business on its own and serves as a blind for someone else.
                            We had recognized other satellites. The results had not been happy. The
                            idea of being a satellite was antithetic to any concept of autonomy
                            implied in recognition.</p>
                        <p>In event the Peiping régime were to show a change in attitude or if the
                            power of those in charge of it should be challenged from within, the
                            United States would certainly not be rigid on the matter of recognition
                            or continue to hold its channels to the Chiang Government. A defection
                            of Peiping from Moscow, however accomplished, would certainly be in our
                            interest. Few turns more advantageous to the United States at this
                            juncture could be conceived of. We certainly would not stand in our own
                            light by failing to take advantage of such a situation or by impeding it
                            by blind adherence to some antecedent viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>The same applies with respect to representation in the UN. Here again the
                            touchstone is Korea. The great obstacle is that the Peiping régime
                            stands before the world as the enemy of the UN. It has challenged the UN
                            in combat. If its position in Korea were cleared up, the question of UN
                            representation would be greatly simplified and altered.</p>
                        <p>It is well for the Chinese to understand that the difficulty between
                            Peiping and Washington does not derive from the issues. Rather the
                            issues derive from the difficulty. That difficulty is that the men in
                            determining positions in Peiping have put themselves in thrall to the
                            enemies of the United States. To the degree that Peiping has come to
                            serve others it cannot serve its own interests. Its own interests
                            dictate peace and accommodation with the United States. The present
                            situation serves only Moscow’s interests. It cannot be eased until the
                            Chinese make the fundamental decision to cut the cords to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Second Party took complete notes on the above discourse. At the
                            completion of it he held forth on the information given him by Third
                            Party. He had taken notes thereon and referred to his notes repeatedly.
                            The essence of the information is as set forth below.</p>
                        <p>The Peiping régime had been established on the basis of a broad <pb
                                n="1483" xml:id="pg_1483" facs="0025"/>appeal to the Chinese. This
                            included nationalism and the greater glory of the national viewpoint. It
                            included the interests of all classes except bureaucratic capitalists
                            and war criminals. These ideas were the bases of a coalition in which
                            the Communists were only one element. The Communists have stayed
                            outwardly within the limits of that coalition. They explain everything
                            in terms of national interest as exemplified in the coalition. They
                            stick to the letter if not the spirit.</p>
                        <p>Three elements make up the coalition. These are: The Moscow-oriented
                            Communists (Stalinists); China-oriented (native) Communists; and
                            non-Communists. Some individuals were clearly identified either as
                            Stalinists, native Communists, or non-Communists, Others were not
                            clearly identified, tending to shift positions from one juncture to the
                            next. It was becoming increasingly clear within China that a small inner
                            group of the régime was completely tied to Moscow. The tie was becoming
                            more apparent, stronger, and more general.</p>

                            it was an accomplished fact. Chou had only been told that some action

                            respected their obligations toward the Government, His assent was <hi

                            action. The result had been, of course, to drive a wedge between Peiping
                            and Washington.</p>
                        <p>Likewise the decision to intervene in Korea had been taken not in
                            consultation with the coalition members but as a move arranged by the
                            inner clique. The deployments which made it possible were carried out
                            without consultation.</p>
                        <p>In appraising these groups it is well to avoid calling them pro-Russian
                            or pro-American. On the face of it all groups are exclusively
                            pro-Chinese. Outside the Stalinist group all are pro-Chinese. Even those
                            who oppose a pro-Russian policy would not stand for being called
                            pro-American.</p>

                            it. His interlocking control is complete and smooth working.</p>
                        <p>The basis of military power is in four big regional armies. Mao
                            manipulates them. He so deploys them as to keep them divided and to keep
                            the reins in his own hands and away from the army commanders.</p>
                        <p>The first of these armies is that of Chen I.<note n="9" xml:id="d2fn9"

                        <p>Significance is to be attached to Mao’s selection of the army of Lin Piao
                            for the Korean venture. He brought it from Canton for the purpose. He
                            was evidently willing to see this army consumed in Korea. The effect is
                            to build up relatively the position of the other forces. Mao was
                            apparently of a mind to hack down the armies both of Chen and Lin Piao.
                            He also seems anxious to keep intact the force on which he chiefly
                            relies—his army in the northwest.</p>
                        <p>Mao is much in the Russian camp. All the way? Third Party thinks he may
                            still be appealed to on the basis of his own interest and in terms of
                            national interest. He might still be told it is not in his interest and
                            the Chinese interest to fight the United States and that a war with the
                            United States would be an unnecessary disservice. He might be shown that
                            it would be in the interest of himself and China to get into a position
                            to play off Russia and the United States against each other and in that
                            way be persuaded to cut his Moscow ties. He might be persuaded that
                            eventually he can’t lick the Americans and that he and the Chinese will
                            have to pay for their intransigence.</p>
                        <p>The so-called middle group, the non-Communist element in Peiping, split
                            their party into splinter groups in August, 1949. This was done to
                            deceive the Stalinists that their opposition was disunited. It was done
                            also in the hope of getting a larger share of men in government <pb
                                n="1485" xml:id="pg_1485" facs="0027"/>positions. The middle group
                            has a dual organization and dual leadership. Its splinter elements have
                            an exposed leadership. Behind them is a secret unified organization
                            under the real leadership.</p>

                        <p>The third group has two objectives—or rather one objective with two
                            stages. The first is to work within the limits of the Peiping régime to
                            persuade Mao that he can avoid war with the United States and that such
                            a war would be inimical to Chinese interests and disadvantageous to
                            himself. The second would be—in event of failure of the first—to attempt
                            a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi>. It would probably eventuate into a
                            long period of chaos. It would be a case of choosing to precipitate
                            incalculable civil violence rather than face the prospect of war with
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The means of persuasion envisaged under the first course is public
                            opinion. It still exists in China despite the monopoly of public
                            channels of information. The middle group hangs together through a set
                            of secret societies. They get information around on a word-of-mouth
                            basis. It is effective. It is more important than the controlled press
                            and controlled radio.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> would involve an alliance with the
                            native communists to oust the Stalinists.</p>
                        <p>The anti-Stalinists are sure that they could get public opinion behind
                            such a move.</p>
                        <p>They believe Chen can be counted on to cast his lot with them. They have
                            provided him with a nifty concubine and a fine new car to get on the
                            good side of him.</p>
                        <p>Third Party would like to be able to give assurances back in China to the
                            effect that the United States would not impede a development away from
                            Moscow by continuing to support Chiang and trying to force him into the
                            leadership of any anti-Moscow move. He would also like to be able to
                            give assurances that the Formosa issue could be settled. Finally, he
                            would like to be able to give assurances that the door is not closed to
                            seating the Peiping régime in the UN.</p>
                        <p>Third Party had in mind some settlement of the Korean business by a
                            simultaneous Chinese and UN withdrawal and the establishment of a UN
                            commission to supervise the establishment of an independent government.
                            The Chinese should be participants in this commission.</p>
                        <p>Third Party’s view was that the Russians had tried to keep the Peiping
                            Chinese out of the UN. This was indicated in the order of the agenda as

                        <p>The anti-Stalinist group would want as to Formosa the withdrawal of the
                            United States fleet and restoration of the <hi rend="italic">status

                        <p>Third Party’s view is that an attack on the 7th fleet might be made at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>Third Party recognized that the issues were not easy. In a way they would
                            be easier if it should prove impossible to bring Mao around and the
                            dissidents were forced into the attempt at a <hi rend="italic">coup

                            would be saved because it would be dealing not with the perpetrators of
                            such acts but with those who ousted the perpetrators.</p>
                        <p>The issues would be hard to handle if the course were to be a detachment
                            of Mao from the Moscow line. Mao could be appealed to only on the basis
                            of Chinese interests and aggrandizement.</p>
                        <p>Third Party wished to be able to carry to China assurances that the
                            United States would not kick them around for being communists even after
                            they may have broken the Moscow tie and begun an independent course. He
                            also wanted to be able to carry back assurances that the United States
                            will see that the Chinese have to see their problems as Chinese
                            problems—that we will not be chivvying them to make declarations and
                            take positions on our side of all the issues.</p>
                        <p>In commenting on points raised by the information relayed from Third
                            Party, First Party spoke along the following line:</p>
                        <p>The Chinese could be assured that the United States would take a
                            realistic attitude regarding internal Chinese concerns such as the
                            internal economic policies and type of régime the Chinese may choose to
                            have. Our flexible attitude with respect to the Tito<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d2fn14">Josip Broz-Tito, Prime Minister of

                                Yugoslavia is included in volume <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >iv</hi>.</note> sufficiently illustrated this. Tito’s internal
                            policies were not to our liking. There had been many grave issues
                            between this Government and the Yugoslav Government. Nevertheless when
                            Tito defected from Moscow the United States regarded the fact of
                            Yugoslav’s new independence from Moscow as of greater importance than of
                            any issue extant between the two Governments. It could certainly be
                            counted on to regard its relations with China with the same realism. One
                            important point should be made however. Tito demonstrated his
                            independence from Moscow under his own steam. He did so for purely
                            Yugoslav reasons. He did not have to be wheedled into it by concessions
                            made in advance of the action. Nations should not require bargaining and
                            wheedling in order to get them to take positions of independence and
                            self-respect.</p>
                        <pb n="1487" xml:id="pg_1487" facs="0029"/>
                        <p>As for the prospect that the United States would show understanding for
                            the Chinese régime if it should continue to be pro-Chinese and in some
                            degree anti-American after cutting its ties with Moscow, it is to be
                            anticipated that the problems between the two countries would be
                            difficult but not impossible of solution. American public opinion has
                            been aroused against China. There has been great resentment against the
                            Chinese action within the Executive establishment and within the
                            Congress. These things will not die down overnight. They can be expected
                            to be ameliorated with the passage of time and with the display of the
                            spirit of accommodation by the two Governments concerned. It must be
                            emphasized, however, that it is up to the Chinese to do their share of
                            the accommodating. That share must be great. It was the Chinese who
                            attacked American troops—not Americans who attacked the Chinese. It is
                            China rather than the United States which has taken a position of
                            flouting international obligations.</p>
                        <p>As for the idea that the United States will seek to draw Mao into a
                            position where he will play the United States against the Russians, that
                            is a difficult prospect for the United States. The better attitude for
                            countries to take is one of accommodation and compromise independent of
                            the idea of playing each other against somebody else. The United States
                            has no intentions of playing China against some third country and
                            vice-versa. It should be able to expect an equivalent attitude from
                            China.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the essential question was one of timing. If the
                            United States were to take a conciliatory attitude before the Peiping
                            régime had cleared its record the United States would be putting itself
                            in the position of appeasement. The United States would be putting
                            itself in a position to be bilked if the Peiping Government should turn
                            out to be not acting in good faith.</p>
                        <p>The United States faces grave dangers. For the time being it may be under
                            a disparity of power as compared with its adversary. Nevertheless, the
                            United States is not under compulsion to go, hat in hand, to beg
                            concessions from those who have helped its enemies. Certainly the
                            situation requires that Peiping make the first move as an earnest of its
                            intentions. This did not involve a loss of face. No nation ever loses
                            face by doing the right thing. To the contrary, a solid and recognizable
                            gesture from the Peiping régime would probably be met more than half way
                            by the United States and American public opinion.</p>
                        <p>Raising a question which did not represent his own point of view, Second
                            Party asked whether it was possible to develop two moves
                            simultaneously—the first the seating of the Peiping delegates in the UN
                            and the second conversations between the United States and Peiping with
                            respect to Formosa.</p>
                        <pb n="1488" xml:id="pg_1488" facs="0030"/>
                        <p>First Party said again that timing was of the essence. The United States
                            Government also had a public opinion and its own self esteem to
                            consider. The United States had eaten a lot of crow. The American people
                            were already fed up with that article of diet. They would not swallow
                            another huge serving of the same just on the speculative chance that the
                            Peiping régime might follow up with an act of a character such as the
                            Peiping régime should take of its own volition anyway.</p>
                        <p>First Party insisted that Korea was still the touchstone of the issue. If
                            the Peiping régime is a minion of Moscow it will be impossible to
                            establish a basis of accommodation between Peiping and Washington. If it
                            is not a minion of Moscow then the Peiping régime can demonstrate this
                            by showing a tractable and reasonable attitude on the Korean issue.
                            Time, however, is short. What is hard to understand is why other nations
                            should make overtures to persuade the Peiping régime to demonstrate that
                            it is capable of acting in its own interest.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the initial requirement is a recognizable gesture
                            from Peiping that it does not want war with the United States, that it
                            has come to a sense of realities and its responsibilities, and is not
                            acting as a minion of the enemies of the United States. The United
                            States has already made manifest its own intentions. It has not carried
                            the war against the Chinese on the mainland. It has stayed scrupulously
                            within the framework of the UN in its actions in Korea. It has been
                            amenable to any reasonable formula for ending the hostilities. Peiping
                            could very easily manifest an equivalent point of view. The real
                            question is whether it can. Is China still master of its own household?
                            To put it another way, is it not too much to hope that Mao can be
                            brought to a course of reason and of independence from the Moscow
                            line?</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that, according to Third Party’s presentation, the
                            tendency of Peiping would be to discount the United States desire to
                            avoid war with China as a factor in the situation. The more truculent
                            elements in Peiping have been insisting that the United States had been
                            deterred only by fear of an attack on Japan and by fear of possible
                            Russian intervention in event the conflict should be carried to the
                            Chinese mainland.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the surmise as given is beside the point. The plain
                            fact is that the United States does not want a war with China and that
                            such a war would be contrary to its interests as well as to Chinese
                            interests and would serve only Moscow. This must be established in the
                            minds of both parties as a condition precedent to any accommodation
                            between the United States and the Peiping régime. First Party said
                            Washington had every reason to discount the likelihood <pb n="1489"
                                xml:id="pg_1489" facs="0031"/>of a Russian interposition in the
                            event of hostilities on the Chinese mainland. Russia would obviously
                            prefer to fight its battles vicariously. The notion of a scrupulous
                            adherence on the part of the Kremlin as to its plighted word to its
                            allies is naive. The satellite countries are not the allies of
                            Russia—they are minions of Russia. Any pledge to them on the part of
                            Russia will be interpreted in the light of Russian expediency. The
                            expedient thing for Russia to do in such a case would be to remain aloof
                            while two of the countries listed as victims of Russia fought a war that
                            was tragic for them and advantageous for Moscow.</p>

                            outlived his usefulness. First Party suggested an inquiry of Third Party
                            as to whether there were any men among the Nationalists on Formosa with
                            whom dissidents on the mainland could work.</p>

                            asked that the following questions be asked of Third Party: How do we
                            get in touch with him if we have a message for him? Does he want us to
                            make other contact points besides [name deleted] and, if so, where?</p>
                        <p>First Party suggested that above all Second Party should seek Third

                        <p>Third Party expressed general agreement with the United States position
                            as told the day before by First Party and as relayed to him.</p>
                        <p>He believed that Mao’s neck was probably irretrievably in the Moscow
                            noose. He said that it was the 11th hour and 59th minute. China appeared
                            to be cast in the role of aggressor against the UN. There was no easy
                            way out of the problems brought on by that circumstance.</p>
                        <p>No one on this side of the Pacific could measure the depth of ignorance
                            of the Stalinist Reds in the Peiping régime. By the logic of their
                            political doctrine no word is believable but that of Moscow. They
                            believe everything from that quarter. They are foreclosed from believing
                            anything else. Moscow had told them war was imminent and that the
                            Chinese were destined to be on the Russian side. The enmity of the
                            United States was such, in the Moscow presentation, as to leave no
                            choice. Third Party had got from [name deleted] … the word that he was
                            quite hopeless, that the attitude of the United States seemed to confirm
                            all that the Russians had told them. [Name deleted] had believed that
                            the United States had shut the door completely on Peiping representation
                            in the UN. By this time he would be back in Peiping, spreading gloom
                            among the non-Stalinist elements.</p>

                        <p>Third Party had said he recognized that the only course was to

                            tied to the Moscow chariot. The opening gambit would be an attempt to
                            precipitate a showdown and woo the régime away from Moscow, but that
                            would be undertaken with the idea that it would eventuate into civil
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>Time is short, in Third Party’s view. The Russians have told them war is
                            just ahead, coming sometime this spring. The Russians—the Peiping
                            Stalinists—have emphasized the importance of being on the winning
                            side—of having an honorable position with the victor. This <pb n="1492"
                                xml:id="pg_1492" facs="0034"/>same source emphasizes that the war
                            will be costly, that China will lose much. But they point out that the
                            defeat of the United States will give them a chance to rebuild at United
                            States expense. The United States has plenty to divide up. It will still
                            have it even when the war is over. In the sequel to victory Moscow and
                            its allies will be able to make good their losses and then some.</p>
                        <p>The other courses open to China are neutrality and turning against
                            Russia. Neutrality is dangerous. It involves the danger of unmerciful
                            punishment in event the Russians should win. If the Russians don’t win,
                            it involves taking chances with a victorious United States.</p>
                        <p>First Party here suggested that Second Party should suggest to Third
                            Party that the Chinese should be under no illusions about the idea of
                            playing along on the Russian side during a war and then switching at the
                            last minute. The hare-and-hounds trick has been overworked. The next war
                            is going to be a tough one if and when it comes. The United States will
                            emerge from it victorious but without illusions. It cannot be counted on

                        <p>Second Party continued with the presentation of Third Party’s ideas.</p>
                        <p>Third Party said that if the United States really wanted to play
                            political warfare, the best thing to do was to let the Peiping
                            government be seated in the UN.</p>
                        <p>In Third Party’s view, the Russians are out to kill the UN. They are
                            developing the World Peace Council as a UN for satellites. The existing
                            UN is repugnant to Russia. It reflects ideas and usages of the
                            non-communist tradition.</p>
                        <p>The United States could put a spoke in the Russians’ wheel by letting the
                            Peiping régime send delegates. This would be a way of countering the
                            generous treatment the Russians were giving Mao.</p>
                        <p>First Party cut in here that the idea of vying with the Russians in being
                            generous toward the people who are helping Russia and fighting us is a
                            tough one to put over with the American public. How would we know that
                            the Peiping régime would not use its place in the UN to help in the
                            sabotage process being pursued by the Russians? Second Party said Third
                            Party had said we would be able to tell the Chinese intentions by the
                            character of the delegation sent. If it contained a large percentage of
                            non-Stalinists this would indicate the intention to use the UN as a
                            point of contact with the West and not as a means of aiding Russia in
                            the sabotage of the UN. First Party commented that this missed the point
                            in that it involved waiting until after the <pb n="1493"
                                xml:id="pg_1493" facs="0035"/>fact to make the determination. The
                            rest of the world would still be in the position of making the first
                            concession, whereas it is the Chinese who are remiss.</p>
                        <p>Third Party recognized the difficulty of this. The idea was still, in his
                            mind, the most effective gambit we could make in the political warfare
                            with the Russians as related to China. It would not be necessary for the
                            United States to vote for admission of the Peiping Chinese. It could
                            continue to vote and rant against such an idea and at the same time
                            remove the obstacles which it has set up with other countries.</p>
                        <p>In Third Party’s view, the essential thing is to give the non-Stalinist
                            forces an opportunity to get in touch with the rest of the world and
                            find out what it is thinking. The trouble now is that the contacts are
                            almost all with Moscow. Admission to the UN would be of great help to
                            the Chinese who have a potentially friendly attitude toward the United
                            States and Britain, etc. It would strengthen their case in arguing that
                            the rest of the world—i.e., the non-Moscow world—has not closed the door
                            on friendship with the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>First Party then raised anew the question of the difficulty, from the
                            standpoint of the future of the UN and American public opinion in regard
                            thereto, in seating the Peiping delegation while Peiping is in notorious
                            violation of the standards imposed by the Charter. Could it be
                            anticipated that the Peiping régime would conform even after being
                            seated? First Party said that an important question which Third Party
                            and his associates should ask themselves is this: Is there any
                            practicable chance that the Chinese intervention in Korea can be called
                            off even if a group in Peiping decided they wanted to call it off and
                            make a peaceful settlement? First Party said he attached great
                            importance to the point that Mao had selected that general known to be
                            closest to Moscow to lead the attack in Korea and had, according to
                            Third Party’s account, made a considerable redeployment of forces in
                            order to do so. In First Party’s view, this meant that Mao was taking
                            care to forestall any possibility of an effective change of heart in
                            Peiping. He was selecting a general who would be responsive to Moscow
                            rather than to his own government in case of any conflict of intention
                            between the two. If this reasoning were correct, then the idea that
                            Peiping can effectively change its stance in the world situation is out
                            of the question. Mao has already burned the bridges. Peiping is no
                            longer the effective capital of China; rather Moscow is. That is what is
                            implied.</p>
                        <p>Third Party was then quoted as saying that, irrespective of the
                            developments as to seating in the UN, the United States should do
                            nothing for the time being about Formosa. Keep the interdiction <pb
                                n="1494" xml:id="pg_1494" facs="0036"/>there. Strengthen the Chinese
                            forces. Use it for bargaining with Peiping in the remote event that the
                            idea of developing a defection of the régime from Moscow should work. In
                            the more likely event that it does not work, the Chinese forces on
                            Formosa will be of great assistance in the warfare that is sure to
                            follow on the mainland. In giving this advice, Third Party felt that at
                            the right time something could be done to get Chiang to step aside and
                            to solve the problems flowing out of our recognition of the Nationalist
                            régime. An accommodation between anti-Moscow forces on the mainland and
                            the Chinese elements on Formosa would have to be worked out, but
                            Chiang’s position in the saddle would certainly prejudice the whole
                            movement. That problem would have to be solved. Meanwhile, however,
                            Third Party suggested that the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> as to
                            recognition and as to Chiang’s position should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>Besides the forces on Formosa and besides the potentially defecting army
                            on Shantung, there are three Chinese armies on the mainland which still
                            retain their identity though they do not count in the present deployment
                            pattern of Peiping. These are the armies of Chen Chien, Fu Tsu-yi, and
                            Chang Chih-chang.<note n="27" xml:id="d2fn27">Chang Chih-chung, a former
                                Nationalist military commander, was Vice Chairman of the Northwest

                        <p>Third Party’s advice: Don’t bomb the Chinese mainland in reprisal for the
                            Korean business. The Chinese people are psychologically prepared for it.
                            The Stalinist elements have warned everybody that we would do it. Now we
                            haven’t. This has caused some propaganda trouble for the Stalinists. The
                            point is not that they were fooling the people. The Stalinists really
                            believed we would bomb.</p>
                        <p>They were sold by Moscow on our hostile intentions. They believed we had
                            aggressive intentions. They told other Chinese this. Others were
                            reluctant to believe it. The Stalinists were prevented for the time
                            being from intervening. Meanwhile they redeployed troops in event it
                            became possible to intervene. The crossing of the 38th parallel gave
                            them their cue. This was presented as proof of our intention not merely
                            to restore the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> but to carry the battle
                            onward. That we have not bombed the mainland tends to undermine their
                            case. Their propaganda has begun to decline in impact because of
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Third Party’s advice: This above all, don’t give us the kiss of death. If
                            Peiping should show signs of independence from Moscow or if, which is
                            more likely, there should be an attempt to overthrow the régime, the
                            United States must not give the results its blessing. It must not
                            trumpet a victory to the world. That would pour cold <pb n="1495"
                                xml:id="pg_1495" facs="0037"/>water on the whole effort. Third Party
                            recalls the painful experiences resulting from references in the White

                            intellectual groups as allies of the United States. He and others in his
                            group had to pound the table and thump their chests in proclaiming their
                            hatred of the United States on that occasion. The same had happened when
                            General Marshall had referred to the non-Nationalists and non-Communists
                            as friends of the United States. All of them had to shout: Not
                            guilty!</p>
                        <p>The United States must not tip its hand. It must give no inkling of this
                            possible development of a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> It would
                            mean the end of all those who might support it.</p>
                        <p>Also, give up any hopes of linking such a movement with Chiang.</p>
                        <p>The United States should be advised to take an urbane view of the
                            developments. A defection toward neutrality is all that can be expected
                            now. If it works, do not expect the Chinese to start sounding off like
                            the Voice of America. They won’t. They will have to state the case in
                            terms to which the Chinese have now become accustomed. They will not
                            dare to talk friendship with the United States. The problem of those who
                            would arrange a defection is how to persuade enough of the others to go
                            along. This cannot be done in the idiom of American propaganda. It will
                            have to be in a Chinese idiom. It will have to be in terms of hostility
                            to foreign influences.</p>
                        <p>The conversations closed on the topic of estimating Third Party’s
                            motives, degree of reliability, etc. Second Party, who impressed First
                            Party well, … He had confidence in him. He believed he would come
                            through in the event. He believed Third Party was honest in his
                            expressed determination to do something to cut the lines that tie China
                            to the Moscow chariot. … What they saw seemed to confirm what Moscow had
                            told them: That the rest of the world had turned its back on Peiping. …
                            He said Third Party displayed a growing comprehension that the issue
                            cannot be compromised—that a nation cannot attach itself to Moscow in a
                            half measure—that it must cut its ties altogether or altogether lose its
                            freedom. This the non-Stalinist elements in Peiping had been slow to
                            perceive. Third Party, Second Party was sure, now saw it.</p>
                        <p>In the third conversation, Second Party passed on further information
                            given by Third Party. He quoted Third Party as saying that the
                            composition of the inner core of the non-communist dissidents in China
                            was a tightly held secret. Third Party was uninformed as to the
                            controlling personalities. … They were described as having <pb n="1496"
                                xml:id="pg_1496" facs="0038"/>secret contacts with one another and

                        <p>One element of dissident strength was said to be the secret societies,
                            which communists have not captured nor even deeply penetrated. The

                        <p>A second element was said to be certain Kuomintang generals who went over

                            distinguished from the underground leadership.</p>
                        <p>Overseas Chinese were said to form a sixth source of strength. Many of
                            these were said to have cast their lot with the new régime, but as
                            patriotic Chinese, not as stooges of the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>A seventh element of dissident strength was said to be the Peoples’
                            Organizations, the Jen Min Tuan Ti, set up by the communists but
                            infiltrated by what Third Party called “our men”.</p>
                        <p>Patriotic Communists form an additional source of strength. The principal
                            personality in this group was said to be Chou En-lai. His arch rival was

                            freest interchange of ideas and argument. The Patriotic Communists
                            engaged in United Front activities were said to be points of contact
                            with the Third Group.</p>
                        <p>Certain points of biographical information were passed on by Second

                        <p>Liu Shao-Ch’i was said to have financial interest in the Sino-Soviet
                            airline. He was said to be doing very well financially but it had not
                            been possible to determine what he was doing with his financial
                            gains.</p>

                        <p>The following were reported to have been branded by the Communist press

                        <p>The question whether Communist China might get into the UN was then
                            discussed, with the factors being reviewed along the lines indicated
                            during the first meeting.</p>
                        <p>Second Party brought up the question of the rearmament of Japan, asking
                            whether it was too late to hold off that development. He said the
                            rearmament of Japan would run counter to the hoped-for events <pb
                                n="1498" xml:id="pg_1498" facs="0040"/>in China. He quoted Third
                            Party as saying the native China <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> on
                            the mainland were interested in reparations.</p>
                        <p>The contingency of a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> was then
                            discussed. Third Party was quoted as saying that a <hi rend="italic"
                                >coup d’etat</hi> could occur on the mainland if a full-blown war
                            should develop or if the Third Group should become convinced that the
                            Communists were planning a purge of dissidents. In event of war, the
                            Communists might be compelled so to deploy their forces as to make it
                            impossible for them to continue their encirclement of the Third Group
                            units.</p>
                        <p>First Party pointed to the dangers of deferring a <hi rend="italic">coup
                                d’etat</hi> until the Stalinists were ready to strike, for then it
                            might be too late. He suggested that the Third Group might be
                            overestimating their own discipline and the firmness of their own
                            information relatively to those factors among the Stalinists. Second
                            Party said he had raised the same question with Third Party and had been
                            reassured of the tightness and discipline within the Third Group
                            although Third Party was aware of the acute danger that the Stalinists
                            might get the first jump.</p>
                        <p>Third Party was quoted again as saying that it would be exceedingly
                            difficult to convince Chou En-lai that peace with the United States was
                            possible and that it would be to the greatest benefit of the Communists
                            in China. Even the Patriotic Communists were said to be deeply convinced
                            that the United States was implacably determined to destroy them and
                            that any idea of accommodation was hopeless. They were said to be
                            convinced that the United States was determined to put Chiang back on
                            the mainland and that, therefore, they had no alternative but to go
                            along solidly with the Stalinists.</p>
                        <p>Second Party stated that Third Party had emphasized to him that the
                            dissidents in China must follow an independent Chinese course and must
                            not serve purely American purposes—“we are your friends, but not your
                            agents”.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that Third Party had indicated that Liu Shao-ch’i
                            appeared to be determined to embroil China in war with the United
                            States. This he recognized was Soviet policy. To this end suicide
                            aviators and submarine crews were being trained for an attack on the 7th
                            Fleet in the strait of Formosa. He interpreted this as designed to
                            provoke the United States into war with China. He expected that this
                            would occur some time this spring.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth conversation, First Party stressed the importance of the
                            need to take the contemplated action while time remains. He explained
                            that the pressures within the public, the Congress, and within the
                            Executive branch of the United States were building up in the direction
                            of seizing the issue with Communist China.</p>
                        <pb n="1499" xml:id="pg_1499" facs="0041"/>
                        <p>First Party said that it was necessary to avoid letting the fat be thrown
                            in the fire rather than to figure what to do once the fat is in the
                            fire. Should events carry so far as complete hostilities between the
                            United States and the Peiping régime, it would be impossible for the
                            United States Government to distinguish between different classes of its
                            enemies. Then all shades of red would be classed as red. There could be
                            no turning back, no pulling of punches, to permit elements within the
                            Peiping régime to take readjustments and redefine their purposes.</p>
                        <p>First Party stressed that the United States would regard a mainland
                            régime reoriented away from Moscow or established by a <hi rend="italic"
                                >coup d’etat</hi> against the Moscow elements as the real political
                            force in China. First Party said, however, that the United States had
                            political alternatives to the one indicated in earlier conversations as
                            coming from Third Party. First Party stressed that it would be well for
                            the new developments to occur before the United States had been forced
                            to freeze its position in some contrary direction.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the United States was much impressed by the basket
                            outlined by Third Party. It was willing to put all its eggs in that
                            basket as soon as it comes into existence. It could not put its eggs in
                            a mere picture of a basket. It had to have an event rather than a
                            prospect as the basis of its action.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that Third Party in effect was saying if the United
                            States would produce just one egg, his group would produce the basket.
                            Second Party said that a relaxed attitude that would permit admittance
                            to the United Nations was all that the Peiping dissidents were
                            suggesting.</p>
                        <p>First Party stressed that the United States Government would appreciate
                            the importance of not hailing such a new régime as friend and ally.
                            Funds authorized by Congress to be spent in the general area of China
                            without the requirement of vouchers were still available in large
                            quantities. These would enable the United States to act subtly in the
                            new situation in China, should it develop, by giving utmost support
                            while outwardly maintaining an aloof attitude.</p>
                        <p>First Party suggested that Second Party should pass on to Third Party
                            that this Government has obtained from sources other than Second Party
                            information in very large measure parallel to that given by Second
                            Party. This other information indicated that a purge of non-Stalinist
                            elements in Peiping was not remote. The opportunity to strike
                            effectively against the Stalinist elements might soon be foreclosed by
                            events of precisely the opposite character.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that any effort to stimulate a sense of urgency in
                            Third Party on this score was unnecessary. Third Party was scared <pb
                                n="1500" xml:id="pg_1500" facs="0042"/>stiff of the prospect of the
                            development indicated and realized to the utmost the need to move as
                            swiftly as possible.</p>
                        <p>First Party repeated that the political situation in the United States
                            made impossible at this time the suggestion of seating a Peiping
                            delegation to the UN. This bore on the relationship between the United
                            States and its European allies. The United States could not possibly
                            vote for the seating of the Peiping delegates while Peiping was
                            conducting warfare against our forces and against the UN, as to do so
                            would disrupt the political unity of the country. For the United States
                            to continue outwardly to oppose this while its allies accomplished it
                            would split our alliance. The public and the Congress could not
                            understand such an action. The justification could not be stated without
                            tipping the hand of the dissidents at Peiping. The necessity of keeping
                            these prospective developments secret ruled out the possibility of
                            opening the UN doors at this time. First Party stressed, however, that a
                            change in attitude toward seating Peiping in the UN was not foreclosed,
                            provided Peiping manifestly changed its attitude. A solution of the
                            problem at the UN could certainly be anticipated as a consequence of,
                            though not as a condition precedent to, a change in course at
                            Peiping.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the points given above might be passed on to Third
                            Party with redoubled emphasis. In general they echoed what First Party
                            had stated in the first and second conversations; he was now speaking
                            after wide consultation and careful deliberation at high levels on the
                            basis of his reports from the earlier conversations, and the views now
                            had greater weight.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said Third Party had put forth the prospects of favorable
                            developments at Peiping as contingent upon seating a Peiping delegation
                            to the UN. Second Party was not certain of the degree of
                            interdependence. However, in Third Party’s view, dramatic proof that the
                            United States had not turned its back on peace with Peiping was
                            essential to the plans of the non-Communist group at Peiping. Otherwise
                            they could not counteract the pressure from Moscow and the pessimistic
                            reports taken back by [name deleted].</p>
                        <p>Second Party asked as to the possibility of a change of attitude on the
                            rearming of Japan contingent upon favorable developments at Peiping.</p>
                        <p>First Party explained that the United States could not reconsider this
                            without positive favorable developments at Peiping. He suggested that
                            Third Party be reassured that the United States planned only to help the
                            Japanese prepare for their own defense, that there was not the slightest
                            intention of reconstituting Japan as a great military power, that the
                            idea of reestablishing Japanese maritime fighting <pb n="1501"
                                xml:id="pg_1501" facs="0043"/>power so that it might again threaten
                            the security of the Asiatic continent on a wide radius was completely
                            beyond the United States intentions. First Party said the Japanese might
                            possibly become capable of operating on a short radius toward the Soviet
                            maritime provinces but the idea of a Japan remilitarized to threaten
                            anew China or the insular or continental areas to the south was out of
                            the question. Our allies such as the Philippines and Australia would not
                            countenance such a rebuilding of Japan, even if the United States wanted
                            it—which it did not.</p>
                        <p>First Party added that the United States policy regarding Japan was only
                            a part of an Asiatic policy. The content of our Japanese policy was
                            derived from the general situation in Asia. A lifting of the immediate
                            Soviet threat or a great alteration in the power situation induced by a
                            defection of Peiping from the Moscow orbit would certainly make it
                            possible to modify our intentions regarding Japan. Japan’s security bore
                            directly on the security of the United States. The security of Japan
                            would be very different if the consolidation of hostile strength on the
                            continent were broken down.</p>
                        <p>First Party stressed also that the United States did not regard Japan’s
                            future primarily in the framework of relations between the United States
                            and Japan. Our hopes lay ultimately in an accommodation between Japan
                            and Japan’s neighbors compatible with the well being and security of all
                            of them. Such an accommodation could not be realized so long as China
                            was working in the interest of a power which was opposed to such
                            accommodation and bent upon penetration and conquest. Obviously Chinese
                            persistence in such a course might force the United States into a
                            different set of aims. Japan’s position vis-à-vis the continent would
                            almost certainly be aggrandized as a result of a war in which Japan
                            alone in that neighborhood would be identified with the winning
                            side.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said in his interchange with Third Party he had gathered the
                            strongest impressions of the prospect of a Soviet attack on Japan as the
                            opening move in a war rather than an attack in Europe. He gave as coming
                            from Third Party a report that the U.S.S.R was building up paratroop
                            forces in Sakhalin.</p>
                        <p>First Party inquired as to the degree of penetration of the Peiping
                            military establishment by Russians. Second Party said Third Party had
                            indicated an awareness at Peiping of the danger of such Russian
                            penetration, though he had no precise information directly bearing on
                            the question. He reported that Russian military missions were
                            circumscribed in movement. They generally kept within their compounds.
                            Mao Tse-tung had shown cleverness in dealing with Russian penetration.
                            Moscow had sent 50 Russian professors to China for the <pb n="1502"
                                xml:id="pg_1502" facs="0044"/>ostensible purpose of strengthening
                            cultural cooperation through visits to Chinese universities. Mao had
                            welcomed them and, suspecting they were <gloss target="#t_NKVD1"
                                >NKVD</gloss> agents, had assigned all 50 to the same university and
                            had them put to work on a translation project of purely cultural
                            importance. They were kept under watch.</p>
                        <p>First Party inquired into the possible effects of a change in the power
                            situation in Formosa, with Chiang stepping out of the picture. Second
                            Party said, citing Third Party, that this could be of the greatest
                            importance in demonstrating that United States policy was not wedded to
                            Chiang as charged by the Stalinists. This should make it possible to
                            bring about a close degree of collaboration between elements on the
                            continent opposed to Moscow and elements on Formosa. It should certainly
                            make for the solidification of Chen I in the anti-Stalinist camp.
                            Collaboration between him and Formosa elements should enable the
                            anti-Stalinist forces to change the situation so as to bring to an end
                            the criticial encirclement of the forces on the continent which had gone
                            over from the Nationalists to the Reds and now were not relied on by
                            Peiping but were kept in a neutralized position. A transfer away from
                            Chiang of power on Formosa would certainly redound to the forwarding of
                            either the reorientation of Peiping or a <hi rend="italic">coup

                            be from this standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said Third Party had identified Chuh Te,<note n="39"

                            Peiping military forces, as non-Stalinist whose attitude might be
                            greatly altered if Chiang were to step out of the picture.</p>
                        <p>The conversation shifted to other possible ways of stimulating the
                            hoped-for developments on the mainland. First Party brought up the idea
                            of a demonstration bombing attack on a selected target of economic
                            importance with a minimum impact on civilian population. Such an attack
                            might be preceded by warnings to the civilian populations over a wide
                            area to take to the country in anticipation of an attack that would show
                            the power of the United States to deal heavy blows at China. The
                            propaganda would emphasize that the United States was staying its hand
                            only out of friendship for the Chinese and in recognition that a war
                            resulting from the mad course being followed by Peiping elements at
                            Moscow’s bidding could result only in tragedy to China and the United
                            States and would serve only Moscow. The propaganda could be presented so
                            as to maximize the lesson that the Chinese should cut loose from the
                            Moscow chariot.</p>
                        <p>First Party suggested the idea of leaflet drops on Chinese cities <pb
                                n="1503" xml:id="pg_1503" facs="0045"/>delivered at night from
                            bombers at high altitude. The leaflets might stress the theme that they
                            might have been bombs but were not bombs thanks only to the patience of
                            the United States in the face of the course of the elements of the
                            Peiping government slavish to Moscow and hostile to the United States
                            and the real interests of the Chinese people.</p>
                        <p>Second Party gave the offhand view that such ventures would be negligible
                            from a propaganda standpoint but might be of help to the dissident
                            forces in Peiping in creating chaos and fear at the right moment. Much
                            would depend on their timing. They might run counter to their purpose if
                            not done right. They might serve only to harden the coalition now
                            formally obtaining at Peiping. It would be important to point the
                            propaganda attacks at the Stalinist elements of the Peiping régime,
                            while avoiding any indication of collaboration with the non-Stalinist
                            elements. It would probably be well to level the propaganda attacks on
                            the pro-Moscow acts of Peiping and those responsible but without
                            indicating any differentiation between specific elements in the régime.
                            The propaganda should certainly stress the possibility of peace between
                            China and the United States and the awful consequences for war.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Second Party might communicate further views on these
                            gambits through personal correspondence with First Party. This might be
                            done after careful and guarded inquiry with Third Party. The interests
                            of security would require great circumspection. …</p>

                        <p>2. For the foreseeable future the Chinese Communist regime will retain
                            exclusive governmental control of mainland China. No basis for a
                            successful counter-revolution is apparent. The disaffected elements
                            within the country are weak, divided, leaderless and devoid of any
                            constructive political program. The great majority of politically
                            conscious Chinese accept the existing Communist regime and see no
                            agreeable alternative to it. No fatal split in the Communist regime
                            itself is now indicated. In particular, the regime is assured of
                            effective control of the Chinese Communist Army, Consequently, although
                            the pacification of certain rural areas, especially in South China, may
                            be indefinitely delayed, the Communist regime can contain and control
                            active internal resistance and maintain indefinitely its authority in
                            mainland China.</p>

                        <p>3. Active resistance to the Communist regime within mainland China

                                    establishing law and order. Banditry has presumably increased as
                                    a result of the social and economic dislocations accompanying
                                    revolution.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>4. No reliable information is available regarding the actual strength of
                            resistance forces in mainland China. It is estimated that some 700,000
                            men may be engaged in active resistance of one sort or another. Of these
                            perhaps 300,000 may be loosely connected with the Nationalist regime in
                            Formosa. The strength and effectiveness of resistance forces on the
                            mainland could no doubt be increased by the provision of a definite
                            organization, command, and plan of action, effective communications, and
                            logistical support. Such a development, however, would bring on more
                            vigorous Communist counteraction. Moreover, the identification of
                            internal resistance with the discredited Kuomintang and with US
                            “imperialistic aggression” would probably reduce <pb n="1505"
                                xml:id="pg_1505" facs="0047"/>popular sympathy with the resistance
                            forces and handicap their operations.</p>
                        <p>5. Some active resistance to the Communist regime can probably be
                            maintained indefinitely in mainland China, especially in southern China.
                            It cannot be expected, however, that such resistance forces could by
                            themselves seriously endanger or overthrow the Communist regime, in the
                            absence of an effective counter-revolutionary movement. The most that
                            could be expected of them would be the diversion and containment of
                            Communist military strength.</p>
                        <p>6. Invasion of the mainland by Nationalist forces from Formosa would not
                            materially improve the prospects for overthrowing the Chinese Communist
                            regime. Apart from the difficulties inherent in mounting such an
                            invasion, there is no reason to suppose that the Communists could not

                        </p>
                        <p>7. It is the declared intention of the Chinese Communists to gain
                            possession of Formosa, by force of arms if need be. The presence and
                            mission of the US Seventh Fleet has, however, deterred them from any
                            attempt to invade the island hitherto. As long as the Seventh Fleet is
                            available to protect Formosa it is at least doubtful whether a Communist
                            assault could succeed without effective Soviet air and submarine
                            support. It is therefore considered unlikely that an assault would be
                            undertaken in present circumstances.</p>

                        <p>10. It is evident that the rulers of Communist China and of the USSR are
                            cooperating closely with each other. There is between them a bond of
                            mutual interest in the elimination of Western power and influence from
                            Asia, in the name Asian liberation and world revolution, but also in the
                            interest of the mutual security of the two regimes. Intensification of
                            hostility between Communist China and the West strengthens this bond by
                            rendering Communist China the more dependent on the USSR for political,
                            economic, and military support and assistance.</p>
                        <p>11. There are certain latent potentialities for conflict between
                            Communist China and the USSR inherent in the possibility of conflict
                            between Chinese national interest and Soviet imperialism. The Chinese
                            Communists would be sensitive to any Soviet attempt to usurp control of
                            the Chinese Communist apparatus and so to reduce China to the status of
                            a satellite. They would also be sensitive to any transition <pb n="1506"
                                xml:id="pg_1506" facs="0048"/>from economic assistance to economic
                            exploitation. Finally there are possibilities for conflict of interest
                            regarding the control of such territories as Sinkiang, Manchuria, Korea,
                            and Southeast Asia. These latent possibilities are unlikely to emerge,
                            however, in the presence of a dangerous common enemy.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">The Vulnerability of China to Economic Warfare, Naval
                                Blockade, Sabotage, and Selective Bombing</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>12. The general economy of China is rural, at the subsistence level, and
                            largely impervious to outside action. The urban economy of China,
                            however, is largely dependent on overseas trade, and the Chinese
                            Communist regime is largely dependent on urban political support. The
                            interruption of overseas trade by economic warfare measures and by naval
                            blockade would create unemployment and unrest, hinder industrial
                            production and development, and create serious financial and
                            administrative problems. Already, however, one third of China’s imports
                            come from the USSR and this flow presumably could be increased if the
                            USSR accorded the necessary priorities and if overland communications
                            were maintained and developed. The net result would certainly be
                            severely damaging, but probably not fatal to the regime.</p>
                        <p>13. The conditions envisaged above would be severely aggravated by
                            selective sabotage and bombing of industrial and especially
                            communications facilities. The ensuing economic and internal security
                            conditions would eventually reduce the external military capabilities of
                            the regime and might conceivably imperil its stability. There would,
                            however, be an inevitable lag between the initiation of such operations
                            and this eventual effect. Neither the Chinese people nor the Chinese
                            Communist regime could be expected to remain passive during this
                            interval. Aerial bombardment, certainly, would be regarded as a
                            transition from localized to general war on US initiative. General and
                            open Chinese attack on all Western interests within reach of the Chinese
                            armed forces would therefore have to be expected, with strong Chinese
                            popular support and probable Soviet assistance.</p>

                        <p>Peking would probably refuse appear to defend case on various <pb

                            next move asking for cease-fire. Nevertheless, we believe hearing should
                            be held, cease-fire should be asked for and in event Peking ignores
                            these actions, passage resolution condemning Communist China for using
                            force in endeavoring deprive Tibet long established autonomy. Whether it

                        <p>3. We have suggested foregoing comparatively mild steps in hope they
                            would appeal to UN, particularly India which we know does not desire
                            come to direct issue with Peking. At same time in absence effective

                        <p>1. For the foreseeable future the Chinese Communist regime will probably
                            retain exclusive governmental control of mainland China. Although there
                            is undoubtedly much dissatisfaction with the Communist regime in China,
                            it does enjoy a measure of support or acquiescence and is developing
                            strong police controls. No serious split in the Communist regime itself
                            is now indicated. In particular, the regime has effective control of the
                            Chinese Communist army. There are no indications that current
                            anti-Communist efforts can achieve a successful counter-revolution. On
                            the basis of the slight evidence available, it is estimated that about
                            700,000 men may be engaged in active resistance operations, ranging from
                            local banditry to organized guerrilla warfare. There is insufficient
                            evidence either to substantiate or deny Nationalist claims that a
                            considerable number of these are associated with the Nationalist regime
                            on Taiwan. These forces are creating widespread disorders and are
                            handicapping the Chinese Communist program despite the fact that they
                            are uncoordinated, lack effective top-level leadership, and so far have
                            developed no constructive <pb n="1511" xml:id="pg_1511" facs="0053"
                            />political program. By themselves and under present conditions these
                            resistance forces do not constitute a major threat to the Chinese
                            Communist regime.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">General Objectives of Communist China</hi>.</p>
                        <p>2. The main objectives of the Chinese Communist regime are to establish
                            and perpetuate its own control over all Chinese territory and to
                            construct in China a Communist economic and social order. The Chinese
                            Communists aim at eliminating Nationalist Chinese and Western power from
                            China and contiguous territories as rapidly as possible. With support of
                            the USSR, they aim further at the final victory of world communism and
                            at Chinese leadership of a Communist Far East.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Sino-Soviet Relations</hi>.</p>
                        <p>3. The Chinese Communists are clearly coordinating policy and acting in
                            close cooperation with the USSR. There is between Peiping and Moscow a
                            defense treaty. There is also at the present time a strong bond of
                            mutual interest in jointly protecting the security of the two regimes,
                            in eliminating Western influence from Asia, and in furthering the
                            success of international communism.</p>
                        <p>4. The current Soviet program of economic and military assistance is
                            contributing to Communist China’s ability to progress toward its
                            military objectives. Western counter-measures against Chinese Communist
                            advances would render Communist China more dependent on the USSR for
                            such further economic and military support as the USSR might be able or
                            willing to provide. It is possible that such measures would result in
                            Communist China becoming an economic liability to the USSR.</p>
                        <p>5. Latent possibilities of conflict between Peiping and Moscow exist in
                            such questions as: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) control of Chinese border
                            territories like Sinkiang and Manchuria; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            ultimate control over Korea; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Soviet efforts
                            to infiltrate and control the Chinese Communist government; and (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) failure of the USSR to meet the economic and
                            military requirements of Communist China. But these elements of
                            potential conflict between Chinese national interests and Soviet
                            imperialistic policy and tactics are unlikely to develop at least so
                            long as Communist military operations against the “common enemy”
                            continue to be successful.</p>
                        <p>6. If Soviet strength should decline sharply in relation to that of the
                            US and its allies, and if, at the same time, the Chinese Communist
                            regime became convinced that it could remain in power through an
                            accommodation with the US and its allies, the Chinese Communist regime
                            might conceivably attempt to break its association with the USSR. This
                            situation is unlikely to develop in the foreseeable future.</p>

                        <p>7. The Chinese Communists are following a course of action designed to
                            destroy US strategic interests in the Far East and to reduce the
                            worldwide power position of the US and its allies in relation to the
                            joint power position of the USSR and China.</p>
                        <p>8. The scale of the Chinese Communist operations in Korea and the
                            unwillingness of the Chinese Communists to discuss a diplomatic
                            settlement except on their own terms indicate that they intend to drive
                            UN forces out of Korea; they have already committed a large proportion
                            of their best troops for this purpose, and are prepared to commit
                            additional forces.</p>
                        <p>9. The Chinese Communists have indicated their firm intention of
                            capturing Taiwan in order to complete the conquest of Chinese territory
                            and eliminate the last stronghold of the Nationalist regime. The Chinese
                            Communists have the capability for mounting an amphibious attack on
                            Taiwan. So long as the US Seventh Fleet is available to protect the
                            island, however, it is unlikely that the Chinese Communists would
                            undertake such an operation.</p>
                        <p>10. The Chinese Communists at present also have the capability of
                            intervening effectively in Indochina.<note n="2" xml:id="d6fn2">For

                            Viet Minh for some time. Direct intervention in strength is almost
                            certain to occur whenever there is danger that the Viet Minh will fail
                            to attain its military objective of driving the French out of Indochina,
                            or that the Bao Dai<note n="3" xml:id="d6fn3">Chief of State of

                            of the Viet Minh. Even if they do not openly intervene in Indochina,
                            they can and probably will increase military assistance to the Viet Minh
                            in an effort to make the French position untenable.</p>
                        <p>11. The Chinese Communists are also capable of securing Hong Kong at any
                            time, and they are likely to do so whenever they have convinced
                            themselves that there is no longer any advantage in leaving Hong Kong in
                            British hands and whenever they are willing to accept the consequences
                            of hostile action against British territory. Similar considerations
                            apply to Macao. In the case of Hong Kong, they might stay their hand so
                            as to utilize the Hong Kong problem as a continuing wedge between the US
                            and UK or to preserve the flow of trade through Hong Kong.</p>
                        <p>12. The Chinese Communists have further capabilities of attacking
                                Burma<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">For documentation on U.S. policy

                            It is estimated that at present they do not have the capabilities for
                            military attack upon Japan.</p>
                        <p>13. Under present circumstances, the Chinese Communists probably have the
                            military capability of concurrently carrying on their operations in
                            Korea, intervening effectively in Indochina and Tibet, attacking Burma,
                            and capturing Hong Kong, while continuing to contain opposition groups
                            within China.</p>

                        <p>14. Because of Communist China’s well recognized enormous numbers of
                            ground forces, the great extent of its territory, and the inadequacy of
                            its communication routes for large-scale Western-type military ground
                            operations, the counter-measures to which Communist China is most
                            vulnerable are the following:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Support of Resistance Forces.</p>
                        <p>By supplying the active anti-Communist forces already present in mainland
                            China with effective communications, military equipment, and logistical
                            support, Communist military strength could be sapped, and their
                            capabilities for operations elsewhere could be reduced. Even under these
                            circumstances, these opposition groups would be unlikely to overthrow
                            the Chinese Communist regime in the absence of an effective
                            counter-revolutionary movement, a political program, a clearcut
                            organization, competent leadership and a plan for action.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Use of Nationalist Forces.</p>
                        <p>The Nationalist Chinese Government on Taiwan has an army in being of
                            approximately 428,000 troops. There is considerable doubt, however, as
                            to the reliability and effectiveness of the Nationalist forces under
                            present Nationalist leadership. The morale and combat efficiency of
                            these forces could doubtless be substantially improved under US training
                            and supervision. Given adequate logistic support, a large portion of
                            these forces could be landed on the mainland. There is considerable
                            question as to whether the Nationalists could mobilize popular support
                            on the mainland or command the effective cooperation of present
                            guerrilla forces. They might, however, be able to capitalize on existing
                            discontent with the Communist regime. Such an operation would for a time
                            occupy considerable Communist military strength.</p>

                            Action.</p>
                        <p>Although the economy of China is mainly rural and operates at the
                            subsistence level, the urban segment of the economy is largely dependent
                            on overseas and coastal trade, and by reason of its concentration in a
                            few localities, is particularly vulnerable to bombardment and blockade.

                            create urban unemployment and unrest, hinder industrial production and
                            development, and create serious financial difficulties. A campaign of
                            aerial and naval bombardment against selected ports, rail systems,
                            industrial capacity and storage bases, in addition to economic warfare
                            measures, would seriously reduce the military capabilities of Communist
                            China for sustained operations, would impair the ability of the regime
                            to maintain internal controls and conceivably might imperil the
                            stability of the regime itself.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Continuation of UN Operations in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The continued maintenance of UN military operations in Korea would result
                            in a significant drain on the Chinese Communists, would pin down a large
                            portion of their crack troops and reduce their war-making capabilities
                            elsewhere. It could have other far-reaching effects, such as weakening
                            the present feeling of invincibility, reducing the prestige the regime
                            is gaining from current successes, encouraging internal opposition and
                            straining relations with the Kremlin.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Koo called by appointment on Mr. Rusk and began the
                            conversation by saying that his Government was “greatly concerned” by
                            the cease-fire proposals and the United States’ support of those
                            proposals. He noted immediately that the situation had perhaps become
                            somewhat academic by reason of the Peiping regime’s counter-proposals,
                            and asked for confirmation that the Secretary of State had in fact
                            indicated that the counter-proposals constituted effectively a rejection
                            of the cease-fire proposition. Mr. Rusk confirmed that this was the case
                            and said that in addition Mr. Austin<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">Warren R.
                                Austin, U.S. Representative at the United Nations.</note> in the UN
                            a few minutes ago had indicated essentially the same thing. Ambassador
                            Koo desired to know what the next move would be, whether it would be
                            particularly the introduction of a resolution finding the Chinese
                            Communists guilty of aggression. Mr. Rusk confirmed that it was proposed
                            by our delegation to introduce a resolution, probably tomorrow, to that
                            general effect, that the matter would presumably be taken up in
                            Committee One, and that the question of sanctions would then possibly be
                            handed over to the Collective Measures Committee.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo indicated that he felt that the UN had sustained damage by
                            reason of the very adoption of the proposals for these particular peace
                            measures in the first instance. Mr. Rusk explained that it had been
                            found desirable to exhaust all reasonable procedures for effecting a
                            pacific settlement of the dispute, and in response to a pertinent
                            question from Ambassador Koo, said that he considered that the UN
                            position would now be firmer after the offer of the indicated proposals
                            and their rejection by the Communists than if the cease-fire proposal
                            had not been put up at all.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo indicated that the National Government was quite prepared
                            to fulfill its own obligations with respect to UN measures, and with
                            reference to the question of Formosa, said that it was supposed <pb
                                n="1519" xml:id="pg_1519" facs="0061"/>that there had never been any
                            intention on the part of the United States Government to make
                            fundamental concessions? He said that the National Government viewed the
                            situation in that area as one where the questions of Korea and Formosa
                            were allied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk asked whether the National Government considered that the
                            defenses of Formosa were adequate to meet an attack from the mainland.
                            Ambassador Koo, after a brief hesitation, said that they were—but went
                            on immediately to indicate that his answer was predicated upon the
                            assumption that the 7th Fleet would remain in the Formosa Strait and the
                            Nationalist defense would get air and naval support from the 7th Fleet.
                            Mr. Rusk had indicated the difficulties that might be experienced even
                            by modern war vessels in sinking large numbers of wooden junks in what
                            might be in large part a night action. Mr. Clubb asked whether Mr. Rusk
                            was aware of the news item from Taipei to the general effect that
                            certain members of the Legislative Yuan proposed to send a message to
                            the United States Congress through the Chinese Embassy requesting the
                            release of Formosa from the restrictions which had been placed upon it
                            to permit them to attack the mainland. Mr. Rusk said that he had not yet
                            seen such message, and Ambassador Koo said that to date he was in
                            non-receipt of any such communication. Mr. Rusk here said that it was
                            desirable in making any proposal for the release of restrictions on
                            Formosa to be clear just what was being proposed: Did it in fact mean
                            that the proposal envisaged the withdrawal of the 7th Fleet? It was to
                            be noted, he said, that in the period since June 27 Formosa benefited
                            more from the President’s directive of that date to the 7th Fleet than
                            did the mainland which possessed the superior military forces. Dr. Koo
                            indicated that the proposals generally should not be taken to mean that
                            the withdrawal of the 7th Fleet was being requested.</p>

                        <p>This memorandum covers a further conversation by long distance telephone
                            between First Party and Second Party mentioned in earlier report of
                            conversations of January 6 and 7 and January 13.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said he had talked to Third Party regarding the points in
                            the last conversation.</p>
                        <pb n="1520" xml:id="pg_1520" facs="0062"/>
                        <p>Third Party had expressed the highest degree of interest in the …
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Third Party said this should be carried “as far as possible”. On First
                            Party’s inquiry, Second Party said this meant “to as many places as
                            possible, over the longest radius possible, and in the shortest time
                            possible”.</p>
                        <p>Time was now of the essence, Third Party had emphasized.</p>
                        <p>The leaflets should contain a long statement in reasonable, dispassionate
                            language.</p>
                        <p>It should stress that the Chinese cannot trust their official sources of
                            information.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Second Party said that Sian-fu had been selected as
                            the capital in event of war. Leaflets should go there.</p>
                        <p>The message should stress the question: Why did the Peiping régime turn
                            down the pacific, generous cease-fire proposal?</p>
                        <p>It should emphasize that this rejection served no Chinese interest, only
                            the interest of a foreign power, the U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>It should be under UN sponsorship. It should list the countries
                            supporting UN actions.</p>
                        <p>It should stress the themes of no territorial ambition and no warlike
                            intention.</p>
                        <p>It should emphasize that the course chosen by those determining Peiping’s
                            choice is unreasonable and contrary to Chinese interest.</p>
                        <p>It should appeal to the patriotism and national feeling of the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>It should state that it is not our objective to dictate the form of
                            government in China, and that the form of the present régime is not the
                            cause of our differences.</p>
                        <p>It should stress that if the Chinese had not allowed themselves to become
                            tied to the Moscow chariot, and got into the reckless Korean adventure,
                            they would by now have realized their aspirations regarding the UN.</p>
                        <p>It should stress that it is not our object to support Chiang Kai-shek and
                            to force him upon China. It should say that if the Chinese should
                            persist in their present course, they may indeed get Chiang back.</p>
                        <p>The message should speak of our esteem for the Chinese people and
                            culture. It should stress our desire to spare their cities from
                            destructive bombardment.</p>
                        <p>It should stress that if the worst comes to the worst the people should
                            clear out of their cities to save their lives.</p>
                        <p>It should stress that the United States is acting in Korea not on its own
                            but in obedience to the UN.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said Third Party was trying to get back as soon as <pb
                                n="1521" xml:id="pg_1521" facs="0063"/>arrangements could be made.
                            He said Third Party had communicated to his sponsors in China the
                            information given as to the United States attitude.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said the … proposal was frowned on by Third Party. It would
                            bring fear and dismay to the Chinese people but would not harm or hinder
                            those who would be its real targets.</p>
                        <p>Second Party quoted Third Party as saying that it would be difficult to
                            make satisfactory arrangements between Third Group elements on the
                            mainland and any of the Chiang old guard on Formosa even if Chiang were
                            out of the picture . . . .</p>
                        <p>In passing on the above information First Party said the following:</p>
                        <p>It is manifestly impossible to carry on as a UN venture the propaganda
                            effort suggested. However, it might be possible to state the proposition
                            in such a way as to emphasize the UN angle and deemphasize the U.S.
                            source. It might even be possible to have the message originate with
                            some non-U.S. source, if possible in the UN, and then pass the statement
                            along to the Chinese as one originating in UN deliberations, stating the
                            source.</p>
                        <p>Under whatever aegis, it would be difficult to make the suggested
                            statements regarding our disinterest in Chiang and the warning that they
                            might get him back. That would have to be done with a light touch and
                            with great indirection if done at all.</p>

                        <p>I agree with you that a strange situation exists in respect to military
                            aid for Formosa. You may imagine how the Chinese here interpret a case
                            in which numerous persons in Washington and Tokyo (even Radio Moscow has
                            a figure of $200 millions) are informed on this subject, while Admiral
                                Jarrett<note n="4" xml:id="d11fn5">Rear Adm. Harry B. Jarrett,

                            of last August. In one of my first telegrams to the Department after
                            arriving here last summer I urged that in our relations with American
                            military and economic officials the principle of full and free exchange
                            of information should be established. I have been through all of this
                            before, and I am convinced that our foreign relations cannot otherwise
                            be conducted effectively. Frankly, however, I was not prepared for a
                            situation in which, after five months, the Embassy and its Armed
                            Services attachés are still studiously excluded from military plans for
                            keeping Formosa outside the Iron Curtain. I consider this subject so
                            vital that, at the risk of repeating much that has been said before, the
                            remainder of this letter is devoted to a review of what seem to me the
                            basic considerations involved.</p>
                        <p>First, we have the very practical problem of making the Seventh Fleet’s
                            mission effective. It has been recognized all along and by all concerned
                            that this island could not be defended successfully against a massive
                            Communist attack simply with the available strength of <pb n="1524"
                                xml:id="pg_1524" facs="0066"/>the Seventh Fleet, the Thirteenth Air
                            Force and the Chinese Nationalist forces as the latter existed on June
                            27, 1950. Our avowed intention, therefore, was to increase the
                            effectiveness of the forces on Formosa by “selected military aid.”
                            During the past seven months, such aid has been limited to one shipload
                            of ammunition. Important as this shipment was and is, the net effect is
                            to leave the island even less well prepared to resist aggression than it
                            was last June. Equipment has suffered wear and tear in the meantime, and
                            not inconsiderable amounts of ammunition and other supplies have been
                            used up in the normal processes of training and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>We shall be much interested in seeing a copy of the Fox Report, which you
                            say will be sent to us as soon as it is available (it has been available
                            to persons in Tokyo for the past five months). Inevitably the Report is
                            already out of date, which need not have been the case had it been in
                            the hands of our attachés in the meantime; and with the best will in the
                            world it could not have been complete in the first place. We learn, for
                            example, that no provision was made for supplying aviation and motor
                            gasoline and fuel oil,<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn6">A handwritten notation
                                in the margin of the source text read “provision made for small
                                quantities, I believe.”</note> to say nothing of the large
                            incidental expenditures involved in handling, storing, maintaining and
                            utilizing an important amount of military equipment. The Chinese
                            Government is close to the end of its financial tether, and has no funds
                            for such purposes. Moreover, our latest information is to the effect
                            that the entire project is being held up while Tokyo pares down the Fox
                            lists to meet new limits fixed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (reportedly
                            $50 million for the Chinese Army, $5 million for the Navy and $16
                            million for the Air Force).</p>
                        <p>The exact amount to be allotted for military aid to Formosa is far less
                            important, however, than the filling of urgent needs immediately in
                            preparation for a possible attack in March or April. As I remarked in a
                            communication to the Department last spring, we must plan on “… getting
                            a supply of 3-inch shells to a friendly army before it runs out of
                            ammunition, rather than forwarding $30 million worth of assorted surplus
                            war material after a critical campaign is lost.” One of the most urgent
                            needs at the present moment is for anything up to 250 propeller-driven
                            fighter aircraft, with the necessary spare parts and fuel. Whether or
                            not those aircraft are here and operational at the time of a Communist
                            attack may well determine the fate of Formosa. If they are not here, and
                            this island is lost, someone will have to do a lot of explaining which
                            will transcend such questions as to whether aid to Formosa should amount
                            to $212.2 million or only $71 million, or who should not have been
                            allowed to see <pb n="1525" xml:id="pg_1525" facs="0067"/>the Fox
                            Report. Presumably funds have been available all along which could have
                            covered really urgent needs, and I understand that the fighter aircraft
                            required are available in our mothball reserve.</p>
                        <p>Second in importance to filling urgent military requirements without
                            further delay is the determination of the form of organization the
                            United States should employ on Formosa to assure the effective use of
                            our aid. Indications are that an “Advisory Group” may be established. I
                            have suggested a somewhat different approach, as you may have noted,
                            which would involve starting from where we are rather than from where we
                            left off in 1948 with something less than glory. At the present time I
                            believe that the United States Government has a good team in Formosa.
                            The Embassy proper, the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> mission and
                            our Armed Services attachés are operating harmoniously and in the
                            closest liaison. We have joint weekly meetings, and files of current
                            telegrams, etc., of each group are made available to key personnel in
                            the other groups. Moreover, we are all in general agreement as to what
                            should be done and how we should go about it.</p>
                        <p>My past experience under similar conditions convinces me that there is no
                            justification for maintaining both a Military Advisory Group and a staff
                            of Armed Services attachés. In Greece we had both, which resulted in
                            duplication and a consequent waste of good talent, besides causing
                            friction. In Austria, with the Army in occupation, we had no Service
                            attachés at the Legation, which was quite logical. I may add that our
                            three senior attachés here in Taipei agree with me: they and their
                            staffs, expanded as necessary, should either assume such advisory and
                            related duties as may be decided upon, or they should all be absorbed
                            into any new Advisory Group that may be established. Of these two
                            alternatives, I strongly favor the first for reasons which I shall now
                            elaborate.</p>
                        <p>Not only have we a good team here at present but there has been
                            gratifying progress in reestablishing confidence between the Chinese and
                            ourselves at all levels. Our sizable staff of Armed Services attachés,
                            including as it does a number of highly qualified senior officers, has
                            been particularly successful in this regard, despite the setback which
                            they received at the time of General Mac Arthur’s visit at the end of
                            last July (see, for example, pp. 4–5 of our despatch No. 78, November 1,
                                1950).<note n="6" xml:id="d11fn7">Not printed.</note> Our attachés
                            are now well set up and ready to start the implementation of a military
                            aid program without delay. On the other hand, the creation of an
                            independent Military Advisory Group, with new heads and with all of the
                            trimmings which traditionally adorn such organizations, could easily
                            delay the practical implementation of an aid program by vital weeks or
                            even months.</p>

                        <p>Judged by our experience with the <gloss target="#t_FECFECOM1"
                                >FEC</gloss> Survey Group last summer (see, for example, pp. 5–6 of
                            despatch No. 78, November 1), and subsequently over the fabulous Fox
                            Report, we must expect that any new Advisory Group which may be
                            established here would exclude the Embassy from its counsels if
                            permitted to do so. We might also expect that direct dealings between
                            the Chief of the Group and the Generalissimo (not to mention Madame
                            Chiang) would become the rule rather than the exception, with the result
                            that our China policy would again depend very largely upon the success
                            or failure of the Chiang charm in winning over individual American
                            generals. However this might work out in detail, it would be only
                            prudent to expect the Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> Mission to be bypassed more and more, as the Military
                            Advisory Group increased in size and experience. A picture closely
                            resembling that of our occupation of Japan presumably would emerge,
                            facilitated by the traditionally military and quasi-dictatorial
                            character of the Chiang regime.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that I need not argue a case with you in favor of retaining the
                            coordinating authority and responsibility for the conduct of our foreign
                            relations in the hands of the Department and the Foreign Service. But
                            all past experience points to the probability of the military taking
                            over if and when they are given huge sums to spend, along with the
                            authority to decide when to withhold information and otherwise act
                            independently of American civilian officials. Failure of the Department
                            to take a stand on this issue in advance will be equivalent to
                            abdicating primary responsibility for the conduct of our relations with
                            China. If it is necessary to do this, then let us proceed with our eyes
                            open and have the record straight at the outset.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing opinions should not be construed as indicating any lack of
                            appreciation on my part of the enormous difficulties to be overcome in
                            carrying out a new military aid program for China. It will require the
                            best efforts of all of us, civilian and military. Actually, our work
                            might be simplified by letting the Army assume major responsibility,
                            while we sat back to enjoy such commissary, PX, APO, club,
                            transportation, USO and other facilities as they might provide. But I do
                            believe that broad political decisions should govern rather than
                            military. Sound political decisions take account of military and
                            economic factors. Military decisions often are based on purely military
                            factors of relatively short-range character. It seems to me the clear
                            duty of the Department and the Foreign Service to play the central,
                            coordinating role in developing and implementing our foreign policy in
                            all of its phases.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the questions I have raised must be considered against <pb
                                n="1527" xml:id="pg_1527" facs="0069"/>a background far larger than
                            Formosa or even China. Some of our military minds, both in and out of
                            the Services, may be coming around to a conception not only of handing
                            over Asia to MacArthur but of giving Europe to Eisenhower. I trust that
                            matters will not go quite so far, but at the present time a highly
                            significant pattern is being worked out in Europe which should serve as
                            a useful guide in Asia. I say this chiefly because much more attention
                            quite inevitably will be given to respecting the sovereignty of the
                            several states of Europe. Yet this factor is no less important in Asia,
                            where greatly expanded American military authority, cutting across
                            boundaries and seas, will appear to countless millions as a new form of
                            imperialism. It might even become such in fact.</p>
                        <p>I may add that I have the very highest respect and admiration for General
                            MacArthur, and that I recognize the desirability of his having authority
                            over any military operations which may involve Formosa, the Philippines
                            and various other areas in the Far East. But the fact remains that
                            MacArthur is not on Formosa, and that we have here a sovereign state
                            which our Government recognizes. I would have no secrets from General
                            MacArthur, but he is an extremely busy man; I would avoid any
                            bottle-neck, in the form of subordinates in Tokyo or elsewhere, between
                            Taipei and Washington, where all major and many minor decisions will
                            have to be made in any case. This would apply to political and economic
                            affairs under any circumstances, as well as to administrative and other
                            military matters not involving actual operations.</p>
                        <p>I justify this incursion into the military field primarily on political
                            grounds, but I also have in mind an episode of 1942. Operations in Egypt
                            were not receiving a high priority in the allocation of American tanks
                            and planes; our Minister in Cairo, Alexander Kirk, kept hammering at
                            Washington on the urgent need for both if Egypt and the Suez Canal were
                            to be held. Members of his staff were later convinced that but for his
                            efforts Alamein would have been Rommel’s<note n="7" xml:id="d11fn8"

                            oppose an approach to friendly UN delegations by the <gloss
                                target="#t_USUN2">USUN</gloss> delegation on the ground that the
                            position of the United States in the UN regarding China is so suspect
                            that any moves regarding Tibet might further injure our chances of
                            getting what we need in connection with Korea.</p>
                        <p>They therefore suggest as an alternative that approaches be made to the
                            various foreign offices and that this approach be in very general terms.
                            It was pointed out to them by Mr. Meyers<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5"

                                January 6, 1951, not printed, instructed the Embassy in London to
                                ascertain whether or not the British thought any United Nations
                                action feasible (793B.00/1–651). The Embassy replied in telegram
                                3803, January 9, not printed, that the informal Foreign Office view
                                was that the United Kingdom should support any move on Tibet’s
                                behalf by India or another power but that the Tibetan problem was
                                subordinate to larger issues and should not be raised at the moment
                                (793B.00/1–951).</note> Therefore it seemed much more desirable to
                            delineate some of the specific advantages to be gained from a
                            hearing.</p>
                        <p>I can certainly understand the desire of <gloss target="#t_UNA1"
                                >UNA</gloss> to avoid any action <pb n="1529" xml:id="pg_1529"

                            However, it does seem unwise to make another general approach to the
                            Indian and French [<hi rend="italic">British</hi>] Foreign Offices. I am
                            of the opinion that if the matter is to be pursued further at all it is
                            necessary to assure in advance that enough members of the Security
                            Council will at least not vote against us to make it worthwhile to raise
                            the issue in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. If our missions are
                            to be able to discuss the matter intelligently with the foreign offices
                            concerned they require a background of the Department’s views on
                            possible advantages to be gained in taking the case into the <gloss

                            the arguments advanced by the Department as their own opinions and even
                            as the opinion of the Department.</p>

                        <p>Second Party called First Party about 9:00 p. m. on January 29. He passed
                            along a message from Third Party.</p>
                        <p>Third Party had had “quite a bit of contact” with his principals in
                            Peiping. Third Party reported that he had received a letter written by
                            [name deleted]. It was dated two weeks previously. It indicated that
                            those “at the top” had come to accept the view, as relayed by Third
                            Party, that an accommodation between the United States and Peiping was
                            possible and that war was not inevitable (note by First Party—this
                            presumably represents a revision of the estimate … to the effect that
                            the United States was obdurately antagonistic toward Peiping and that an
                            accommodation was impossible even were Peiping to make concessions).</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that Third Party quoted [name deleted] letter as saying
                            that the top level in Peiping took very seriously the suggestion that
                            the Peiping Government should give evidence of a desire to reach
                            accommodation by making the first move. Accordingly Chinese forces in
                            Korea would proceed to break contact and to withdraw in order to provide
                            the foundation for a solution that would save face for everyone
                            concerned. This was the best that the Peiping régime could do inasmuch
                            as “their friends” (the U.S.S.R.) were looking over their shoulders.</p>
                        <p>Third Party said that the letter from [name deleted] had stated that
                            Peiping felt that the retraction northward of its forces would be the
                            first move and that Peiping would be awaiting the United States’
                            reaction thereto. Peiping was most anxious to get together with the
                            United States and talk. First Party inquired of Second Party whether any
                            indication had been given as to where Peiping wished the talks to take
                            place—in or out of the United Nations. Second Party said that he was
                            sure that either arrangement would be acceptable. Second Party quoted
                            Third Party as saying that the letter from [name deleted] went on to
                            state that it would be necessary for Peiping to “talk big” so as to keep
                            its partner (the U.S.S.R.) happy. This would have to continue.</p>
                        <p>[Name deleted] letter was quoted as saying that Peiping recognized the
                            problems which would confront the United States in attempting to bring
                            about a detent and an accommodation. The letter was quoted as saying
                            that those within the United States Government attempting to <pb
                                n="1531" xml:id="pg_1531" facs="0073"/>work out this problem with
                            Peiping would also need to recognize that Peiping had similar problems,
                            particularly its problems with its big brother (the U.S.S.R.).</p>
                        <p>The letter was quoted as emphasizing that those in power in Peiping meant
                            business in this approach. They were said to wish to withdraw completely
                            from Korea and to be determined to avoid an all-out war with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Second Party passed on the information that Third Party believed that the
                            spokesmen for Peiping meant everything they said regarding the “present
                            United Nations resolution”.<note n="1" xml:id="d14fn1">Sir Benegal Rau,

                                authority” that if a condemnatory resolution passed, there was no

                            apparently referred to the pending resolution calling for the naming of
                            the Peiping régime as an aggressor).…</p>
                        <p>On January 30, about 10:20 a. m., First Party called Second Party to
                            clear up certain elements in the conversation as recorded above.</p>
                        <p>The first question raised was as to who was meant by the earlier
                            reference to the “top level” in Peiping. First Party raised the question
                            whether [name deleted] was passing on Chou En-lai’s reactions or the
                            views of the Government, including those of Mao Tse-tung. First Party
                            referred to the consideration that it seemed unlikely that a <hi
                                rend="italic">démarche</hi> of this character would be undertaken
                            without the approval of Mao. Second Party said that the letter as quoted
                            to him had given no direct indication one way or the other as to whether
                            Mao’s views were reflected in [name deleted] letter.</p>
                        <p>The question was raised also as to the meaning of the retraction
                            northward. Second Party said definitely that the letter had declared
                            Peiping’s intention to give up Seoul without a fight and to withdraw all
                            of its forces north of the 38th parallel without giving appreciable
                            battle to the UN forces.</p>
                        <p>Second Party gave two points not specifically covered in the earlier
                            report on the letter. He said he had had them in mind but had forgotten
                            to put them across in the earlier conversation. The first point was to
                            the effect that the domestic situation on the Chinese mainland had
                            deteriorated badly and that the Peiping régime was not confident of
                            popular support in pursuing an intransigent line vis-à-vis the UN and
                            the United States. The second point was that those in power in Peiping
                            were taking a “now or never” attitude—that is to say, they believe they
                            were badly over-committed, that they face the danger of a war <pb
                                n="1532" xml:id="pg_1532" facs="0074"/>which they could not afford
                            to fight and could not successfully conclude and that they believed it
                            necessary to push forward arrangements for a peaceful conclusion as
                            rapidly as possible so as to avert the imminently threatened war.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that the factor of the timing of Third Party’s
                            communications with his principals was most important. He raised the
                            question how long it required for a message to go from Third Party to
                            Peiping. He asked Second Party to get definite information on this.</p>
                        <p>First Party called Second Party at 7:30 p.m. on January 30. He told
                            Second Party that it was important for him to get three points over to
                            Third Party.</p>
                        <p>The first point was that the whole record of the communications involving
                            First Party and Second Party was being given closest study at high and
                            authoritative levels in the United States Government. Third Party’s
                            report quoting his letter from [name deleted] had been carefully
                            reviewed. It was regarded as of the highest importance.</p>
                        <p>The second point was that the report of [name deleted] letter had reached
                            the United States Government too late to make it possible to call off or
                            defer the pending action on the resolution to pin the aggressor label on
                            the Peiping Government. This led to a question as to whether the United
                            States attitude might have been different if the message had arrived
                            earlier. First Party said that it was pointless to speculate along this
                            line. Second Party said Third Party had been most gravely distressed
                            over the delay in receiving the letter. He said that Third Party had
                            reflected an understanding that in view of the delay it would be
                            impossible to arrest the course of events at Lake Success. The action
                            would have to move forward. The wheels of government, once set in
                            motion, are almost impossible to stop in a hurry. The United States
                            public posture in relation to the aggressor resolution should be judged
                            on this statement and in light of the statement that [name deleted]
                            letter was taken very seriously.</p>
                        <p>The third point was that Third Party should expect another important
                            message through the same channel in a very short time.</p>
                        <p>First Party stressed to Second Party that he should impress upon Third
                            Party that the current message and the important message to follow
                            should be communicated to his principles with all possible speed. First
                            Party also said that those in high authority in this Government
                            understood Peiping’s problems of having to take public postures which
                            were quite different from the undisclosed intentions. It was essential
                            that those in determining positions in Peiping should have the same
                            understanding of the problems of the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In this light it was important that the action on the aggressor
                            resolution <pb n="1533" xml:id="pg_1533" facs="0075"/>not be interpreted
                            as foreclosing an eventual amicable settlement of issues with Peiping.
                            First Party said that it was not impracticable to speculate that a
                            double chain of events might be set up so as to permit both Peiping and
                            Washington to work their way covertly toward the peaceful solution which
                            both apparently wished to bring about and at the same time to
                            dissimulate their course of action by the public attitudes which their
                            respective situations required.</p>

                        <p>Marshall explained to General Roberts the background of the conversations
                            involving First Party, Second Party, and Third Party. Marshall explained
                            that he was First Party through most of the reported conversations and
                            that John Davies, a colleague, had been First Party in a small portion
                            of them.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts asked for the identity of Second and Third Parties.
                            Marshall identified Second Party and gave the credentials of Third Party
                            insofar as he understood them. General Roberts compared the name of
                            Third Party with a name appearing among several words on a card put away
                            in some of his papers. He seemed to be reassured.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts then proceeded to read the file on conversations. This
                            file was complete except for the report of conversation dated January
                            19, 1951.</p>
                        <p>Marshall explained that he was not an expert on internal Chinese affairs
                            and had been selected to make contact with Third Party through Second
                            Party for the reason of a lack of such identity.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts said he agreed with the analysis indicated in the report
                            of conversations to the effect that Mao Tse-tung was irretrievably tied
                            to Moscow. He said that he believed that the present apparent retraction
                            of Chinese forces in Korea had been forced upon the Chinese by their
                            domestic circumstances and that Mao had not been able to carry through
                            what he had started to do. He did not believe, however, the retraction
                            indicated that Mao was changing his point of view away from Moscow. He
                            said that he believed that in the last analysis that <pb n="1534"
                                xml:id="pg_1534" facs="0076"/>Mao would prove to be Moscow’s servant
                            and that he would have to be removed before a real understanding could
                            be established between the United States and Peiping.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts said that he also was loath to believe that Chou En-lai
                            was a patriotic communist rather than a Stalinist communist. He said he
                            regarded Chou En-lai as completely treacherous and undependable from the
                            standpoint of the United States.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts suggested the desirability of a check on Third Party’s
                            reports about particular Chinese concerning whom First Party had made
                            inquiries in the first conversation. He said this was particularly
                            important as to Chang Fa-kwei. Marshall said that Mr. Krentz would be
                            more familiar with these details as to Chinese affairs than he himself
                            was. He had gathered from Mr. Davies and Mr. Krentz the general
                            information that Third Party’s appraisals were generally upheld by other
                            information available and indicated reliability.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts gave the general appraisal that the line of conduct
                            suggested in the reports of conversations was the most important
                            opportunity conceivable for the United States in the immediate future.
                            He said this should be played to the limit and every possibility along
                            this line exploited.</p>
                        <p>Marshall explained the general point of view developed in the Policy
                            Planning Staff to the effect that Yugoslavia was a most likely target
                            for Russian attack, delivered through the agency of satellites, in the
                            very near future and such a move on the part of the Soviet system had a
                            potential of undermining our whole position in Europe. General Roberts
                            said he agreed with this viewpoint and had just prepared a memorandum to
                            Mr. Harriman dealing with the same prospect. Marshall gave the opinion
                            that what Russia might attempt in the Mediterranean area would be very
                            vitally influenced by the degree and manner of United States commitments
                            in other parts of the world—that is to say, in the Far East. He
                            speculated that Russia had attempted and was attempting to involve the
                            United States in a struggle with China so as to create a situation in
                            which Russia could have the highest degree of freedom in making a move
                            against Yugoslavia. General Roberts agreed to the general relationship
                            between the Chinese-Korean problem and the prospect in Yugoslavia and
                            inferentially in Western Europe. He said he regarded the liquidation of
                            the Korean problem as therefore of the very greatest moment.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts said he understood and agreed with thoroughly the
                            necessity of a high degree of dissimulation in carrying forward an
                            attempt to reach a settlement with Peiping along the lines indicated in
                            the conversations. He gave the view that it would probably be necessary
                            to take a very select few of the leaders in Congress into
                            confidence.</p>

                        <p>General Roberts said that he would seek to set up immediately a
                            conversation between Marshall and Mr. Harriman so that Mr. Harriman
                            could be apprised fully of the developments. He would try to arrange an
                            hour’s interview for this purpose.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>General Roberts emphasized his belief that in the long run a <hi
                                rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> would be the only avenue to setting
                            up the situation in Peiping to bring about a settlement with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts placed great emphasis on the idea of a leaflet drop on
                            Chinese cities—the . . . . Marshall told him of the conversation with
                            Second Party on this subject and of Third Party’s views as reported.
                            General Roberts said that something along this line should be worked out
                            at once in his opinion. He strongly favored the idea of starting the
                            leaflet with the statement that “It might have been a bomb”. He said he
                            believed this would have a direct and very significant impact on the
                            Chinese mainland. Marshall said others in the Department of State more
                            familiar than himself in internal affairs in China looked with disfavor
                            on the idea of this blunt reference to the idea of a bomb. General
                            Roberts said he disagreed with their point of view.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts emphasized the importance of getting over to the Pentagon
                            the references in the reported conversations concerning the imminence of
                            attack on Formosa, the training of suicide pilots and submarine crews,
                            and the reported impression on the Chinese mainland that the opening
                            attack in a war might occur in the Far East. General Roberts said he did
                            not agree with this latter view but that he thought that it should be
                            passed along to the Pentagon anyway. He said that he believed that the
                            Russians would open up everywhere at once if and when they finally
                            should have recourse to war.</p>
                        <p>Marshall said that point had been raised about the importance of getting
                            the strictly military information on to the Pentagon but that he would
                            follow up to make sure that this had been done.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts and Marshall then discussed the implications of the
                            aggressor resolution in relation to the prospects of a settlement with
                            Peiping. Marshall pointed out that the passage of this resolution,
                            considered imminent and now inevitable, would require as an eventual
                            element in a settlement some action purging the Peiping Government of
                            the aggression charge. This would be difficult to bring about, Marshall
                            said. General Roberts agreed. He said from this point of view the
                            ousting of Mao Tse-tung, in his judgment, was necessary. He said that an
                            ouster of Mao would enable the successor government to disavow all acts
                            taken under the aegis of Mao’s premiership and thus would ease the way
                            for clearing China of the aggressor charge.</p>

                            of these things might, however, be done in the event of a limited war
                            with China or of a general war with China alone. I think we should bear
                            this in mind.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nitze</hi>: We in the Planning Staff think that
                            there is a bearing of our position in the Far East on Soviet intentions
                            with respect to Yugoslavia. Our present disposition in the Far East
                            somewhat increases in our opinion the risk of an attack on Yugoslavia,
                            The Soviet Union, if it extends the war in the Far East, might have a
                            better chance, in its view, of attacking Yugoslavia without incurring a
                            total reaction. If it is our estimate that there is a real risk of an
                            attack on Yugoslavia in, say, 60 to 90 days, then this is another
                            consideration which we need to bear in mind in discussing the Far
                            East.</p>

                            satisfactory in view of the qualifying remarks which introduce these
                            objectives. I refer to the opening statement which indicates that all of
                            these objectives must be considered in relation to the national security
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>General agreement was expressed.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General Bradley</hi>: The fifth objective,
                            paragraph 1<hi rend="italic">e</hi>, is stated as follows: “To break the

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi>: The major problem in connection with
                            this objective is the distinction between overt and covert action. We
                            will have a hard time with some of our friends who do not want to get
                            involved in any civil war in China. I do not think that any change in
                            language is needed but I think we should be aware of this problem.</p>
                        <p>General agreement was expressed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General Bradley</hi>: The sixth objective,
                            paragraph 1<hi rend="italic">f</hi>, is stated as follows: “To deny

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi>: The question in this objective is to
                            what extent are we willing to pursue this objective to the end of the
                            trail? I think we can distinguish three major attitudes on the question
                            of Formosa: (1) some countries—perhaps most countries except the
                            Philippines and the U.S.—believe that Formosa is not of any strategic
                            importance and that it can be regarded as a pawn to be played in any way
                            that suits their interests; (2) some countries regard the Cairo
                            commitment more seriously than we do—we feel that the Cairo agreement
                            has already been compromised by the actions of the Soviet Union; (3)
                            some countries feel that, although it is important to ensure the
                            physical separation of Formosa from the control of the government on the
                            mainland, the fact that Formosa is the seat of a rival Chinese
                            Government is a troublesome and complicating factor. For example, the
                            U.K., I believe, agrees that we should keep Formosa out of the hands of
                            a hostile power but the U.K. does not see how this can be managed
                            without involvement in internal Chinese affairs under present
                            circumstances. It would be very helpful if the U.K. could agree with us
                            on the strategic importance of Formosa. I am not familiar with the
                            discussions you have had with the British Chiefs.<note n="17"

                            any likelihood of a meeting of the minds with the British Chiefs on this
                            question or do you feel that the British Chiefs express in this
                            connection the Foreign Office point of view?</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs indicated that the British Chiefs probably did express
                            the Foreign Office point of view on this issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General Bradley</hi>: The problem is also
                            complicated I think by the question of Hong Kong.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Sherman</hi>: I think that the British
                            would not wish to extend the principle that when an ally is confined to
                            an off-shore island we should write them off on that account.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Rusk</hi>: I would also like to inquire what is
                            the mission of the 7th Fleet. In our view if Formosa is attacked and we
                            come to its defense and fail in the attempt to defend the island, a bad
                            political situation will arise. Is our commitment a limited one? For
                            example, what will happen if a landing is achieved and the Communists
                            are advancing with some success? How much do we intend to back up the
                            7th Fleet in such a situation?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">General Bradley</hi>: I think we are all agreed
                            that we do not want to commit ground forces to the defense of Formosa.
                            The island should be defensible by the Chinese ground forces with our
                            sea and air support. With a little help from us on equipment the Chinese
                            Nationalists should be able to do the job. However, if they are
                            infiltrated and cannot do the job, the question is what are our
                            responsibilities in that situation. I doubt whether we are responsible
                            for any further action if the island is lost as the result of defection
                            by Chinese Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Sherman</hi>: The interposition of the 7th
                            Fleet was announced at a particular time for a particular purpose,
                            namely to localize the fighting in Korea and to prevent the extension of
                            hostilities in the Far East. If the large number of soldiers now in
                            Formosa cannot defend the Island against an attack, even with the help
                            of the 7th Fleet, then I think the same conclusion must apply to Japan
                            and the Philippines. However, I do not accept that conclusion. In the
                            foreseeable future we should be able to deny Formosa to the Chinese
                            Communists with the 7th Fleet, some air support and the Chinese
                            Nationalist ground forces. If we come to the point where this cannot be
                            done, then I think we should revise our position on Formosa.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nitze</hi>: Does this responsibility in Formosa
                            increase the size of the forces which it is necessary for us to maintain
                            in the Far East? Or is it thought that there would be sufficient notice
                            of an attack so that we could pull the necessary ships back from Korean
                            waters?</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs indicated that the Formosan assignment did not in
                            general increase the size of the forces which the U.S. must maintain <pb

                            Collins indicated in addition that the assignment would of course impose
                            some additional requirements for ammunition and certain other

                            Nationalist forces on Formosa.</p>

                            inquired why the language of paragraph 1<hi rend="italic">f</hi> had
                            been revised to read “hostile Chinese Government” rather than “hostile
                            government”. Mr. Rusk said he would be glad to delete the word

                            Matthews, Rusk, Nitze, Davies, and Marshall were present:</p>
                        <p>It was fully agreed that the procedure outlined for liquidating the
                            Korean difficulty was correct in principle. Mr. Rusk expressed the view
                            that some cease-fire arrangement along the lines of the December
                            cease-fire proposal<note n="1" xml:id="d18fn1">For documentation

                            made as the basis for the mutual withdrawal, however, as otherwise there
                            would be no way to ensure that the Chinese Communists would carry out
                            their part in good faith. Mr. Davies and Mr. Marshall pointed out that
                            this put the Chinese Communists in the position of having to accept
                            formally what they had previously rejected. This would involve a loss of
                            face and make it difficult for them to accept. In a later discussion on
                            this point Mr. Nitze pointed out that the Chinese Communists position
                            could be compared to our own. We were anxious to withdraw but still we
                            would not withdraw unless acceptable arrangements were made for our
                            withdrawal. If such arrangements could not be made, we would have to dig
                            in and wait the matter out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Davies gave the opinion that in these circumstances it would be
                            necessary for us to rely on air patrols to ensure compliance with the
                            informal withdrawal. Mr. Matthews expressed doubts of reliability of air
                            observance for such purposes. Mr. Davies said we must put first things
                            first, however, and that the highest desideratum was to be able to get
                            out of Korea gracefully and expeditiously and that this was paramount
                            over nice arrangements about policing a mutual withdrawal. Mr. Nitze
                            said as an alternative we might consider the idea of announcing publicly
                            our intention not to go beyond the 38th parallel if the adversary
                            withdrew beyond the 38th parallel and to faze out a withdrawal matching
                            the adversary’s withdrawal beyond the Yalu River with air patrols to
                            observe the enemy’s compliance. Mr. Rusk had left before these points
                            were made and the matter was deferred until the next day for further
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>It was also brought out it would be necessary to get some evidences of
                            status from Third Party before proceeding much further with the contact.
                            This might be done by testing him out on the proposition of getting the
                            Chinese Communists to release a missionary, Dr. Wallace,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d18fn2">Dr. William L. Wallace, a Southern Baptist
                                missionary, was Superintendent of Stout Memorial Hospital in Wuchow,

                            by them. This last suggestion was made by Mr. Rusk.</p>
                        <p>It was suggested also that we inquire into Third Party’s views as to
                            whether recent military views stem from the position of the Chinese
                            Communists as reported in [name deleted] letter. We should also get his
                            views as to whether intervening events have washed up the possibilities
                            suggested in that letter. The developments as indicated in the letter
                            have not precisely materialized. How does Third Party explain this? It
                            was suggested that the relay of these questions be deferred at least
                            until Thursday so that we would not appear over-anxious.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Matthews was informed of the plan to have Marshall talk to Mr.
                            Harriman. He gave his approval.</p>
                        <p>The idea of having someone go out “in ten days or so” to Hong Kong to
                            begin informal discussions with representatives of the Peiping régime
                            was discussed. Mr. Nitze suggested it should be “some one like
                            Marshall”. Mr. Matthews agreed. Mr. Davies said that Marshall or whoever
                            else went should not be the one who was in direct contact with the
                            Chinese but should be a source of guidance to the man we already have on
                            the spot.</p>
                        <p>The question also was raised as to the point in the memorandum to the
                            effect that evidence tended to confirm the reports as given from [name
                            deleted] letter. It was agreed that circumstances did not justify this
                            conclusion inasmuch as the Chinese had not withdrawn above the 38th
                            parallel or evacuated Seoul.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Nitze suggested that to show the evidence of our good faith in this
                            approach we should tell Third Party that we would delay action in the
                            Collective Measures Committee<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">Nitze was

                        <p>4195. Reference statement by Rau, Indian delegate, UN, that if Communist
                            China condemned as aggressor, door will be closed to peaceful

                            Timing most propitious as large number of nations would support <gloss

                            that adoption by Assembly of any resolution naming China as aggressor in
                            Korea would preclude Chinese participation in any international

                            to speeches in UN by UK, Canada and NZ delegates as indication change in

                            resolution. He said time had now passed when any statement could be

                            position, it has never indicated any desire regularize its relationship
                            with UK. Chou’s reply to Nehru, in opinion <gloss target="#t_FonOff1"
                                >FonOff</gloss> people, was clumsy and ineffectual attempt influence

                            <p>How the conversations came about.</p>
                            <p>First Party’s presentation, particularly as to the identification of
                                Moscow as the enemy, the possibilities of peace with Peiping, and
                                the issues as to Formosa, recognition, and representation in the

                        <p>Mr. Harriman inquired as to information in the conversations concerning
                            Indochina and internal economic conditions. On the first point Marshall
                            reported negatively. On the second he gave the substance of the [name

                        <p>Marshall resumed the briefing covering the following items:</p>

                            <p>The possibilities of bringing about a defection or <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>The gist of the last communication from Third Party respecting
                                Peiping’s disposition to liquidate the Korean situation and as a

                        </quote>
                        <p>Mr. Harriman expressed greatest interest in the account. He recommended
                            that the possibilities be exploited to the utmost. He said he wished to
                            be kept informed of developments. He gave assent to the suggestion that
                            we elicit some evidence of good faith and power from Third Party and
                            that we be willing to give equivalent evidence in return—possibly
                            through making and going through with an offer to delay proceedings in
                            the Collective Measures Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harriman said that it was of the utmost importance to get a reading
                            on the speed of communications between Third Party and Peiping and Third
                            Party’s interpretation of the effect of events intervening since the
                            despatch of [name deleted] letter.</p>
                        <p>The discussion turned to the possibilities of an informally arranged
                            cease-fire to be registered in a formal cease-fire. General Roberts
                            emphasized the essentiality of collaborating with the Pentagon in such
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>General Roberts asked Marshall to recount the conversations regarding the

                            great interest in this. He and General Roberts both emphasized that this
                            was a good idea and should be exploited in any event.</p>
                        <p>At General Roberts’ suggestion, Marshall reviewed the direct military

                            represented a “Pyrrhic victory” for the United States. It was difficult
                            for the people of Asia to understand why we considered the problem of
                            Korea to be a United Nations matter while we had taken unilateral action
                            with regard to Formosa. The people of Asia consider that by taking
                            unilateral action to prevent Formosa falling to the hands of the Chinese
                            Communists the United States took the first overt act against the
                            Chinese and, therefore, the Chinese intervention in Korea is not
                            entirely unjustified. In the long run the Chinese Communists may be
                            expected to act in accordance with Chinese national interests which are
                            opposed to those of Russia, in particular, in Manchuria. As the U.S. has
                            no direct interest in China as such, it would be to the U.S. interest to
                            permit the Asiatics to make peace between China and the U.S., and thus
                            to inhibit the strengthening of bonds between Peking and Moscow. There
                            was a general feeling in Asia that the apparent determination of the
                            U.S. to continue hostilities in Korea was dictated by considerations of
                            national prestige, we never having had the experience of losing a war
                            and being unaccustomed, as are older civilizations, to making strategic
                            retreats from positions we have once taken. The Chinese situation is, in
                            some ways, comparable to the American Revolution and the U.S. should
                            consider its intervention in Formosa in the light of the attitude it
                            would have taken if a European power would have declared a <hi

                            Pakistan is entirely able to understand why the Chinese Communists were
                            unwilling to accept the December cease-fire proposal as Pakistan,
                            itself, had had bitter experience with the cease-fire in Kashmir<note

                        <p>Mr. Rusk stated that it was the formal position of the U.S. that Formosa
                            was in the hands of China. He explained at considerable length that the
                            considerations which had led the U.S. to neutralize the Island at the
                            time of the outbreak of hostilities in Korea, it being at that time
                            impossible to determine whether the Communists move into Korea was
                            immediately to be followed by aggressive Communist moves elsewhere, and
                            the necessity for assuring that in such an event the resources of
                            Formosa would not fall into the hands of the enemy. He explained the
                            different situation of Formosa and our desire not to embarass any of our
                            friends, who, though sympathetic to the necessity for preventing Formosa
                            falling into the hands of Communist aggressors, would find it difficult
                            to take a public position in the UN on the matter. Mr. Rusk also
                            discussed the nucleus of Chinese administrators and technicians on
                            Formosa, who though not necessarily pro-Chiang, were clearly
                            anti-Communist and would be subject to severe Communist reprisals. He
                            explained that subsequent Intelligence has entirely justified our
                            original view that the North Korean attack was clearly instigated and
                            supported by Communist China and Russia and, therefore, must be
                            considered in the pattern of overall Communist aggression rather than a
                            local Korean or Asian problem. He stated that Intelligence had
                            confirmed, that long prior to June 25, <pb n="1550" xml:id="pg_1550"
                                facs="0092"/>the Chinese Communists had released two divisions of
                            troops from their armies to the North Korean Army to enable it to carry
                            out the attack, and that the USSR had supplied the greater part of the
                            munitions. Therefore, the Chinese intervention in Korea could not be
                            considered as having been provoked by the U.S. policy toward Formosa,
                            but rather as a part of the pattern of Communist aggression and,
                            therefore, indivisible from any aggression anywhere. The United States
                            could not accept the thesis that the Korean problem was solely an
                            Asiatic problem. Aggression anywhere was a world problem and the U.S.
                            was particularly concerned with Korea as a Pacific area problem having a
                            direct relation to the security of Japan. It was impossible to believe
                            that withdrawal of UN and Chinese Communists forces from Korea, as
                            apparently envisaged by the Asians, leaving the country at the mercy of
                            the North Korean aggressors could result in anything but continued
                            turmoil and the falling of Korea to Communism. Mr. Rusk also stated that
                            the difference in the view expressed by the Minister and those of
                            ourselves arose primarily from the apparent difference between the
                            interpretations of what China was up to in this affair. It was our view
                            that the Chinese actions in Korea could not be separated from the
                            overall pattern of Communist aggression, and that whatever policy
                            China’s national interest may dictate, the experience with Communist
                            satellites in Europe has shown that once a country came under Communist
                            domination, it was thereafter difficult for it to act except at the
                            dictate of Moscow.</p>
                        <p>The entire conversation was very friendly in tone, but it was obvious
                            that the Minister was not very strongly persuaded to our view.</p>

                            about its existing”. He added that he had asked Third Party for an exact
                            statement of the contents. Third Party had told him that the message was
                            cryptic and required interpretation based on advance agreement as to
                            meetings between himself and the source.</p>

                        <p>First Party said it was important to know what was in the letter itself
                            and what was derived from interpretation. First Party asked Second Party
                            to get Third Party’s interpretation as to the effect of intervening
                            events on the intentions as expressed in the letter. Specifically is the
                            general lack of tactical contact in Korea obtaining in the last couple
                            of weeks a reflection of the intention expressed in the letter? He also
                            asked for Third Party’s view as to whether Mao Tse-tung was a party to
                            the views expressed in the letter and whether, on the assumption that he
                            was, the situation indicated a veering away from Moscow on the part of
                            the Peiping Government rather than the developing likelihood of a <hi
                                rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that he had discussed this with Third Party. Third
                            Party had concluded that Mao was a party to the view and that a veering
                            away on the part of the régime rather than a <hi rend="italic">coup
                                d’etat</hi> was the developing prospective. He added that he thought
                            this was based on interpretation rather than specific information
                            included in the letter.</p>
                        <p>First Party said “We are in earnest about this. We are willing to show
                            our earnestness.” If Third Party needs to get back to his principals
                            that he is talking to sources near the centers of responsibility in this
                            Government he might be told that First Party had given the information
                            that the Collective Measures Committee at the UN was not going to make
                            haste about the business in hand and that the prospect was that there
                            would be no meeting for a week. First Party suggested that if Third
                            Party’s principals required other proof a test might be arranged. His
                            principals could give the name of someone in the traditions of their
                            country and specify a time on the Voice of America when this name should
                            be mentioned. The authenticity of First Party’s sources could be
                            demonstrated by having the particular name mentioned on a broadcast at
                            that time.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that a demonstration of authenticity from the other side
                            should be given in the event that Third Party’s principals are
                            interested in establishing a contact. First Party said that a U.S.
                            Senator had approached the Department of State asking for help in
                            obtaining the release of William Wallace, a U.S. national and a medical
                            missionary, arrested late in December at Wucho, China. First Party said
                            if there was real earnestness on the part of Third Party’s sources this
                            could be manifested by releasing Dr. Wallace and permitting him to
                            proceed to Hong Kong. This would show that Third Party had access to
                            real authority.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that after the demonstrations and counter-demonstrations
                                <pb n="1552" xml:id="pg_1552" facs="0094"/>of authenticity had
                            worked properly, the important matter to proceed to was the question of
                            getting down to really substantial talk. He said that authorities in the
                            line of policy in Washington had taken interest in Third Party’s
                            communications and were also interested in the prospect of establishing
                            a place and a contact for talking business to the end of liquidating the
                            Korean affair in an expeditious and mutually satisfactory way.</p>
                        <p>Second Party asked for a recapitulation on the idea of the informal
                            exchange of credentials. He remarked that a code might be set up for
                            further communication with Third Party, if such should be useful, after
                            Third Party’s return to China. He suggested this might be done through
                            pre-arranged phases to be used on Voice of America broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>First Party inquired as to the possible speed of communications between
                            Third Party and his sources. Second Party said that communication could
                            be by cable provided the ideas were clear and simple.</p>
                        <p>First Party explained that he would be away over the week-end.</p>

                                adjourned at this time. It would still be preferable to advocate an
                                indefinite postponement even though the likelihood of a constructive
                                United Nations discussion of the Formosa question has greatly
                                diminished. The only possible disadvantage of an indefinite
                                postponement would be the opportunity for any member to propose
                                discussion of the item at any time prior to the adjournment of the
                                current session. However, there has been no indication that any
                                Member desires to discuss this item in the Assembly. Moreover, the
                                decision to postpone this item until the 6th Session would offer an
                                opportunity for any Member to insist on the discussion of this
                                question next September when the 6th session opens and would make it
                                somewhat more difficult for the United States to advocate further
                                postponement at that time if such postponement should appear

                            <item>It would be theoretically possible for the General Assembly to
                                terminate its current session when it disposes of the three
                                remaining items on the Political Committee agenda, with the
                                understanding that the Good Offices Committee and the Special
                                Committee on Collective Measures against the Chinese Communists,
                                would report to a special session which may be called later on or to
                                the next Assembly. However, this alternative is hardly practical.
                                The calling of a special session and organizing it is a burdensome
                                process. Moreover, it is obviously desirable that both the Good
                                Offices Committee and the Special Committee should be able to
                                maintain a constant contact with the Political Committee of the
                                Assembly as long as the Korean emergency continues. Thus, the
                                current session may continue until the opening of the next session

                                n="1558" xml:id="pg_1558" facs="0100"/>Chiang Kai-shek. The other is
                            the Acheson clique. It has little control over the war but it does run
                            the foreign policy. It is not devoted to Chiang. It would prefer peace
                            to war with China. If the MacArthur clique were in control, China would
                            already have been bombed. The fact that it has not been bombed shows
                            that the MacArthur clique does not entirely control the policy and
                            United States intentions must not be interpreted entirely on the basis
                            of what the MacArthur clique says. The Wake Island conference<note n="1"

                            result in the MacArthur clique’s imposing its will on Truman, despite
                            reports to the contrary in Peiping. The clique with which peace is
                            possible is in power in foreign affairs. It is necessary to understand
                            that United States policy is run by cliques much like the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Third, there would be no advantage to China in bringing on an all-out
                            conflict. Quite the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said that Third Party assured him that his sources went
                            directly up as far as Chou En-lai. He is certain that Mao is also
                            knowledgeable to the point of view expressed in the communications.
                            Third Party said it would be necessary to know the subtleties of Chinese
                            politics in order to understand this. One is not necessarily in or out
                            of something. He might be half involved in two different positions. That
                            would be possible with Mao. He might be playing along with the
                            dissidents and yet in the end might swing over with the Stalinists in a
                            showdown. Chou En-lai is firm with the Third Group on the war issue in
                            event of a showdown. He and Mao probably understand each other perfectly
                            on all this. His belief that Mao knows about it is stronger than a
                            conjecture and not as strong as a certainty.</p>
                        <p>The letter from [name deleted] is probably a reflection of the earlier
                            [name deleted] rather than a flash on the further information
                            communicated by First Party in the first interview, Second Party
                            said.</p>
                        <p>Third Party cannot use cables for such information as given him in these
                            conversations. He has arranged with his sources for a simple code to
                            flash a few prearranged ideas but nothing as complex as the ideas given
                            in these conversations. To attempt them by cable would be insecure. The
                            Stalinists would be privy to all the information. His principals would
                            be compromised. The whole prospect would be jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>… In the United States Third Party is acting alone. There is no contact
                            that would have security except by mail. Third Party said that these
                            messages from First Party would precipitate a decision as to a defection
                            of the régime from Moscow or a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi>. If
                            the answer should be yes on the idea of talks, then the defection would
                                <pb n="1559" xml:id="pg_1559" facs="0101"/>appear imminent. If it
                            were no, then a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> would be necessary
                            and would occur right away, in his opinion.</p>
                        <p>First Party said that a good idea might be to fly Third Party to London
                            at once to let him get off his messages and get an answer and then
                            return him if necessary to the United States to commence his journey
                            home.</p>
                        <p>Third Party [<hi rend="italic">Second Party</hi>] said he would inquire
                            into the possibilities at once.</p>
                        <p>First Party said he would inquire into the possibilities at the
                            Government’s end.</p>
                        <p>They should match information as soon as possible, it was agreed. First
                            Party said an alternate would call Second Party about this over the
                            week-end, as he, First Party, would be away.</p>
                        <p>Third Party was reported as saying that the suggestion of talks as given
                            by First Party would arouse great response. He regarded it as of highest
                            significance.</p>
                        <p>Third Party wanted precise information on Dr. Wallace, the missionary in
                            duress. Did we know the precise time of the arrest and the charge? Did
                            we know what Wuchow was the scene of the arrest? Was it Wuchow in
                            Kwang-si province or where? He was sure it would be possible to arrange
                            a release as soon as he could get a cable through, provided there was
                            interest in talks on the part of Peiping.</p>
                        <p>Third Party would have to make up a story to explain the cable regarding
                            talks and springing the missionary. He would have to say that he had met
                            a man . . . . The man returned and said someone in the Government of the
                            United States wanted to talk. He, Third Party, had declined. The others
                            were insistent. Finally someone went to a distant city to approach him.
                            The man was from Washington. Talks were arranged. He met a high
                            official. (He said Dean Rusk would be the ideal one). This official told
                            him the true state of United States opinion and policies. He urged Third
                            Party to get a message through. Third Party did because he believed it
                            in the interest of his government (Peiping) to do so. Third Party said
                            it would probably be well to make an arrangement for him to see Rusk or
                            someone like him … briefly as a cover for the story, as he was watched.
                            He would have to be able to tell a story that would stand up. He said
                            all this was necessary as his cable would be sprung in the midst of
                            government circles necessarily. The occurrence would have to be
                            explained.</p>

                        <p>First Party inquired whether there was anything new to report. Second
                            Party answered “no”.</p>
                        <p>First Party then expressed our misgivings about Third Party’s itinerary

                            slow. First Party was turning over in his mind possibilities for a more
                            direct and quick means of communication. He suggested for consideration
                            the following possibilities: <list>

                                <item>We would designate a non-official intermediary—like Second
                                    Party—who is already there or would be sent there.</item>

                                    sent would be there on some sort of normal official

                        </p>
                        <p>The possibility was also advanced of Third Party proceeding to London by
                            way of Hong Kong, stopping off there to expedite matters. Another
                            suggestion was the possibility of our transmitting to Hong Kong through
                            our own channels a message from Third Party which could then be put in
                            the form of a letter and mailed from there.</p>
                        <p>First Party emphasized that the foregoing were all merely suggestions
                            designed to speed up matters.</p>
                        <p>Second Party stated that he would discuss these possibilities with Third
                            Party, but doubted that Third Party could designate a point of contact
                            in Hong Kong. This was so because Third Party would not <pb n="1561"

                        <p>Second Party stated that he had discussed questions brought up in
                            telephone conversation of February 3 with Third Party. Third Party says
                            position of his group is very delicate and any change in his plans might
                            look suspicious. For this reason it would be impossible for him to
                            proceed to Europe via the Far East.…</p>
                        <p>Third Party says that it would be no help to have someone in Hong Kong
                            (or elsewhere in <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>) at present, as
                            several weeks will be required for Peiking tempers to cool over the
                            aggression resolution and it would not be profitable to initiate any
                            talks now.</p>
                        <p>As to Formosa, Third Party feels that March and April will be the
                            critical months and that he’s confident that no decision on an attack
                            will be made before he (Third Party) gets back to Peiking. Chou En-lai
                            and others realize that the Formosa attack is a dangerous undertaking
                            which could fail; therefore they will be willing to explore means of
                            settling the problem other than by attack. However, if we use Chiang’s
                            forces against the mainland, all hope of a coup d’etat or a defection
                            from Moscow will be irretrievably lost.</p>
                        <p>As to the prospect of mutual phasing out of operations in Korea, Third
                            Party feels that this is now complicated by the aggression resolution
                            and that it may have to be a rather long drawn out process, as the
                            Chinese must now save some face and must bear in mind Big Brother
                            looking over their shoulders. However, Third Party feels that the
                            situation is quite static and can be stalled along without too great
                            dangers.</p>
                        <p>Third Party feels that it will be of continuing importance for Peiking to
                            feel that there are some people here who understand what is politically
                            possible to the regime, and who understand that Big Brother cannot be
                            disposed of over-night.</p>
                        <p>Questioned as to whether the foregoing views of Third Party might not
                            represent a bit of Oriental price-raising by Second Party [<hi

                        <p>The Colombian Ambassador brought Dr. Urdaneta in to call on the Secretary
                            by appointment at 11 o’clock this morning. The Secretary opened the
                            conversation by congratulating Dr. Urdaneta for the outstanding job
                            which he has done as Chairman of the Political Committee of the General
                            Assembly, and the patience and skill with which he has handled a
                            difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Urdaneta expressed appreciation for the Secretary’s comments. He said
                            that it had been a long hard session and that he hoped very much that
                            the work of the committee could be completed by Wednesday or Thursday.
                            Dr. Urdaneta said that he felt that the General Assembly should not
                            formally adjourn but that it should recess to meet again on the call of
                            the chairman. The Secretary and Mr. Hickerson expressed full agreement
                            with this and added that Senator Austin had been instructed to strongly
                            support this course of action.</p>

                            the second meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, February

                                xml:id="d28fn4">On February 4, Chou cabled Urdaneta requesting that
                                the text of the speech which Wu had been prepared to deliver at the
                                First Committee in November 1950, in support of the Soviet
                                complaint, be read at the February 6 meeting and printed and
                                distributed as an official document by the U.N. Secretariat; the
                                text of the cable was sent to the Department in telegram 1117 from
                                New York, February 5 (795.00/2–551). Telegram 688 to New York,
                                February 6, instructed the U.S. Delegation that, since the Soviet
                                charges were directed against the United States, the delegation
                                should not participate in any debate on this issue and should
                                abstain on any decision (320/2–651). At the First Committee’s
                                meeting on February 6, Urdaneta ruled that the text of Wu’s speech
                                should be circulated; the Committee upheld his ruling and rejected a
                                Polish motion that the speech should also be read to the Committee.
                                For the record of the meeting, see A/C.1/SR.440; the text of the
                                speech was circulated as A/C.1/661.</note> He said that he did not
                            anticipate that the Chinese Communists would send a representative back
                            to Lake Success to take part in these discussions. He added that the
                            Committee had given the Chinese Communists every consideration and every
                            opportunity to be represented and that they had chosen to send General
                            Wu back to China when they knew the items would shortly be coming
                            up.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Urdaneta inquired what attitude the United States would take in
                            regard to the Formosa item on the agenda. Mr. Hickerson stated that when
                            the item is reached, the U.S. Representative will propose that the
                            Committee postpone indefinitely any further discussion of this matter
                            but leave it on the agenda. Under this procedure the Interim Committee
                            could, if it considered it desirable, study the matter and make
                            recommendations to the next regular session of the General Assembly or
                            indeed to a special session if one should be held. Dr. Urdaneta said
                            that in his opinion this was a wise course. He added that he hoped that
                            Senator Austin would in his statement refer to the desirability of a
                            plebiscite. He said that last autumn he mentioned the desirability of a
                            plebiscite to Vyshinsky who said that this was completely out of the
                            question since Formosa had been settled by the Cairo Declaration and
                            that, moreover, 90% of the people of Formosa strongly supported the
                            Chinese Communist Government. He said that he then inquired why if that
                            were true Mr. Vyshinsky could have any objection to a plebiscite but he
                            did not receive a good answer to his question. Mr. Hickerson said that
                            Senator Austin’s statement would refer to the Secretary’s opening
                            address to the General Assembly on September 20<note n="5"

                            the consideration of the Formosan problem the General Assembly might
                            wish to endeavor to ascertain the wishes of the Formosan people
                            themselves. He added that specific mention of the plebiscite might well
                            touch off a discussion that would unduly prolong the work of the
                            Committee.</p>

                            January 25, 1951, approving the allocation of $71.2 million for military
                            aid to Formosa for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951 with certain
                            reservations, and to <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>’s memorandum
                            dated January 27<note n="2" xml:id="d29fn2">Neither printed.</note>
                            suggesting the deletion of <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>’s first
                            reservation (that no commitments or deliveries to the Chinese be made
                            until certain basic policy decisions respecting Formosa have been
                            reached) This approval can be taken to cover the $50 million allocation
                            set forth in the Secretary’s letter of January 30, 1951 to the Bureau of
                            the Budget.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Not printed.</note>

                        <p>In suggesting the need for basic policy decisions respecting Formosa
                            prior to undertaking any commitment to the Chinese respecting the
                            implementation of the Fox Mission recommendation, <gloss target="#t_CA1"
                                >CA</gloss> had in mind the following considerations: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The Fox Mission recommendation for the Chinese Army and Air
                                    Force are based on the assumption that the Seventh Fleet will
                                    continue available for the defense of Formosa;</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The present policy under which the Seventh Fleet is available
                                    for this purpose is temporary and nominally contingent upon
                                    developments in Korea;</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Without <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> availability of U.S.
                                    naval and air forces for its defenses, there is at least a
                                    strong possibility that Formosa would fall to the Communists,
                                    notwithstanding the provision of military equipment and
                                    advice.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Consequently, supplying such aid might well result in merely
                                    increasing enormously the Communist loot on Formosa if a later
                                    decision is made to withdraw U.S. naval and air support.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is thus a certain logical relationship between decisions respecting
                            the Seventh Fleet and implementation of the Fox recommendations. It
                            seems worth pointing out that if we do not arrive at <pb n="1565"
                                xml:id="pg_1565" facs="0107"/>a decision respecting the former
                            before proceeding with the latter (and it may, of course, be impossible
                            to follow such a logical sequence), this logical relationship will
                            operate to make our implementation of the Fox recommendations largely
                            prejudge our decision respecting the Seventh Fleet and to make any
                            subsequent solution for Formosa through the UN or through negotiations
                            relating to a Korean settlement much more difficult, if this should
                            become desirable.</p>
                        <p>It is with these long-range consequences of the active implementation of
                            the Fox Mission recommendations in mind, that <gloss target="#t_CA1"
                                >CA</gloss> would suggest avoiding commitments to the Chinese, or
                            actual delivery of supplies, except in so far as such commitments may be
                            supported by basic decisions and estimates regarding Formosa—some of
                            which are still to be made.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> is drafting a letter to the Defense
                            Department raising certain questions regarding the basis for their
                            current Formosa military aid programming. For example, it would be
                            interesting to know what Defense expects to achieve with the large
                            assistance programs contemplated for Formosa: $71.2 million programmed
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951, $212 million recommended
                            informally for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952, and additional
                            sums for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1953 through 1955. Is all
                            this assistance purely for the defense of Formosa as contemplated in

                            would Defense justify this aid in the light of (1) the Fox Report,
                            indicating that a continued commitment of U.S. naval and air forces is
                            necessary for the Island’s defense, and (2) <gloss target="#t_NIE1"

                        <p>The program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951 could perhaps be
                            justified at this time as an interim measure, but until basic policy
                            decisions respecting Formosa are made, implementation of this program
                            will, in <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss>’s opinion, necessarily lack
                            full logical justification. <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> would not
                            recommend that the policy reservation mentioned in its memorandum of
                            January 25 be attached to <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>’s approval
                            of the allocation of funds for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951,
                            if the effect of such a reservation would be to delay implementation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1951 program. However, it is
                            suggested that any figures used in programming for <gloss

                            approval be withheld until our questions have been answered and basic
                            Formosa objectives clarified.</p>

                        <p>8. The discussion turned to the possibility of exploiting or creating
                            fissions in China. It was stated that the Chinese Government still lacks
                            cohesion. There are the Chinese Nationalists on Formosa, some elements
                            which are both anti-communist and anti-Chiang Kai-shek, and some
                            anti-Soviet elements in the Peiping regime, all of which represent
                            divisive forces. However, any federation of these elements is difficult,
                            and each of the several groups is affected by a certain amount of
                            inertia. It is a little early to judge, but there are indications that
                            the action in Korea is causing strain in Peiping. Three or four weeks
                            ago, it looked as if the communists might want to get out of Korea. The
                            Korean affair is less popular in China proper than in the capital. The
                            Communists still have the only tight political organization in China,
                            and in spite of some dissension, they are holding together. Something
                            new must happen before we can expect a real split in the party and if we

                            that it will cover the points recommended previously by the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff. It was thought desirable to discuss several of them at this
                            meeting, i.e., naval blockade of China, reconnaissance over Chinese
                            territory, and the possibility of employing Chinese Nationalist troops
                            against Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Blockade</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. It was noted that the Joint Chiefs of Staff considered a naval
                            blockade should not be established against China unless UN troops should
                            be forced out of Korea. It was explained that a naval blockade of China
                            would not apply to Port Arthur but would apply to Soviet ships in
                            Chinese waters. The conferees were reminded that the Soviets have
                            respected the UN blockade of Korea and may well follow the same pattern
                            if a UN blockade is established against China. Unilateral blockade of
                            China by the United States would not be desirable since it is an act of
                            belligerency, it would mean an acceptance of war with China and it might
                            not be respected by the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>15. It is still possible that means can be found to establish an
                            effective pacific blockade (i.e., an economic blockade with naval units
                            assisting in its implementation). Because of the volume of Chinese
                            coastal traffic, a pacific blockade could not be made entirely
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>16. Unless the British were partners to a blockade, it would be difficult
                            to prevent the misuse of Hong Kong. Obstacles to the effectiveness of
                            controls at the source are the ability of the Chinese to transship
                            cargoes delivered to ports in Southeast Asia and shipments by rail from
                            Port Arthur. To combat the latter, we would have to consider destroying
                            the rail line by gunfire, air bombardment, and possibly by shore raiding
                            parties. In the event it were decided to enforce a blockade, it could be
                            done without limiting our naval activities in support of Korea, Formosa,
                            and Hokkaido. It was stated that we are seeking through the UN the
                            adoption of selective restrictions on exports to Red China.</p>

                            been expressed previously by the Joint Chiefs of Staff were summarized.
                            It was noted that U.S. military forces in the Far East are now
                            respecting Chinese territorial waters and are not overflying Manchuria.
                            It was noted that restrictions relative to reconnaissance along the
                            China coast should be removed. The Department of State will study the
                            matter of reconnaissance over Manchuria.</p>

                        <p>It was noted that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">J.C.S.</gloss> paper was
                            written at a time when it seemed we would be forced into a beachhead
                            around Pusan. It appears now that from a military viewpoint
                            circumstances do not warrant using Chinese Nationalist forces on the
                            mainland of Asia. Our actions now are based on the premise that we
                            should do nothing to spread the war outside Korea. If the present
                            hostilities with China are extended beyond Korea, many possibilities
                            will be opened up such as blockade, amphibious raids, and air action
                            against the Chinese mainland. It was noted that if our forces should be
                            attacked outside Korea, we should retaliate. It was noted that a mission
                            should be established on Formosa if <gloss target="#t_MDAP1"

                        <p>On February 7, 1951, the First Committee of the United Nations General
                            Assembly rejected a Soviet draft resolution (A/C.1/637), requesting
                            Security Council action to stop alleged United States aggression in
                            China, by 49 votes to 5, with 3 abstentions, and another Soviet draft
                            resolution (A/C.1/660), requesting Security Council action to stop
                            alleged United States violations of Chinese air space and other illegal
                            acts, by 50 votes to 5, with 2 abstentions. For the record of <pb

                            the United Kingdom Representative to adjourn debate on agenda item 71,

                        <p>On February 13, the two Soviet draft resolutions were reintroduced in the
                            General Assembly (A/1776 and A/1777) and defeated by votes of 48 to 5,

                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The President has given the Seventh Fleet a mission to protect
                                    Formosa against attack and can be expected to continue that
                                    mission indefinitely into the future in the absence of a major
                                    change in the situation in the Far East. This mission involves
                                    the heavy U.S. commitment which requires maximum assistance from
                                    the Island itself. Our military assistance program should be
                                    pressed vigorously in order to put the Island in the best
                                    possible state of defense.</item>

                                    with the termination of the mission of the Seventh Fleet. As a
                                    matter of fact, the mission of the Seventh Fleet could more
                                    readily be terminated if the forces on Formosa are in the best
                                    possible position to defend themselves.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>There is full policy basis for the vigorous pursuit of a
                                    military assistance program for Formosa within the limits of
                                    available funds and matériel.</item>

                                <item>The priority of the Formosa program may require adjustment
                                    from time to time. Presently, its priority should be related to
                                    the United States commitment represented by the mission of the
                                    Seventh Fleet. If the mission of the Seventh Fleet changes, the
                                    priority may go up or down, depending upon the circumstances at

                        <p>Before commencing the main subject of the conversation, Mr. Rusk wanted
                            to clarify a point with respect to Formosa made in his previous
                            conversation with the Prime Minister.<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">For a
                                memorandum of Rusk’s conversation with Prime Minister Holland on
                                February 6, see <ref target="frus1951v07p1#pg_155">p.
                                155</ref>.</note> Mr. Rusk indicated that Formosa had a political as
                            well as a military significance for the United States. In its latter
                            context Formosa in Communist hands would provide a springboard for
                            attack on the Philippines. As a political consideration, however, it
                            must be remembered that Formosa was actually in the hands of the people
                            we had in mind at Cairo. Whatever might be thought of Chiang Kai-shek,
                            the vision of thousands of Chinese being executed by the Communists
                            because of their friendliness toward the United States weighed heavily
                            in our thoughts. It is therefore important to separate the fact of the
                            physical possession of Formosa from the political problem of its entry
                            into the United Nations, recognition of the Peiping regime, and the
                            eventual disposition of Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stated that he was extremely interested in learning
                            American thoughts concerning sanctions against Communist China. Mr. Rusk
                            stated that it was difficult to explain to the American public the
                            present state of “half-war, half-peace”. We do not, however, desire war
                            with China. Our attitude is to have the question dealt with in the
                            United Nations in order to remove the focus of prestige considerations
                                <pb n="1571" xml:id="pg_1571" facs="0113"/>from Washington while
                            taking measures designed to make the aggression unprofitable to the
                            aggressors. Although it is hard to hurt an area as large and sprawling
                            as Communist China, we feel that there are nevertheless certain items of
                            a strategic nature (armaments, petroleum products, capital equipment,
                            strategic metals, etc.) which, if cut off completely from the Chinese,
                            would raise the cost of aggression. We prefer to have imposed an embargo
                            of selected items with which everyone would cooperate rather than a
                            general embargo to which all would not subscribe. Mr. Rusk indicated
                            that the United States agreed that this matter should be approached with
                            care and we believed that the Collective Measures Committee served the
                            purpose of a governor to prevent precipitous action and give our friends
                            an opportunity to air their views.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk stated that we favored dropping discussion of Chinese Communist
                            membership in the United Nations for the present and that there be no
                            further recognitions of the Peiping regime, although some of the
                            recognitions already granted might be useful in maintaining direct
                            contact with Peiping. Finally, Mr. Rusk pointed out that the restraint
                            with which the United States had acted in not attacking the Manchurian
                            “safeaven” could not be continued were the Chinese Communists to launch
                            a full-scale air attack on the United Nations Forces. The Prime Minister
                            agreed, but hoped that an opportunity would exist for an expression of
                            the views of the countries participating in Korea before such action
                            would be taken.</p>

                                        would like to see the Communist regime overthrown, they do
                                        not generally look upon the Chiang Kai-shek regime as an
                                        alternative and only a small fraction of these would
                                        consider Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek clearly preferable to
                                        Mao.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>In short, there is particularly in South China a latent and active
                                opposition which might be developed through skillful encouragement
                                and assistance. This opposition would be most responsive to the
                                appeal of a “third force” largely independent of both the Kuomintang
                                and the Communists and promising a “new deal” to China. It would be
                                much less responsive to a return of General Chiang and his personal
                                clique of <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> supporters.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing might be interpreted as meaning that if opposition to
                                the Communists in mainland China is to be developed and exploited
                                fully, General Chiang and his close associates should be replaced on
                                Formosa. However, this is believed to be an oversimplification of
                                the problem.</p>
                            <p>It is true that many great leaders of history have frequently gone
                                through periods of defeat and rejection by their own people only to
                                emerge strong again. Those who have effected such comeback, however,
                                are definitely in the minority. It is to be granted that General
                                Chiang Kai-shek possesses certain essential qualities of leadership,
                                    <pb n="1576" xml:id="pg_1576" facs="0118"/>namely, supreme
                                confidence in himself and his cause, political determination, and
                                stubbornness, adroitness in political maneuver and an unwavering
                                opposition to Communism. It is likewise true, however, that he has
                                as well grave shortcomings, prominent among which, as evidenced by
                                his failures of recent years, are his basic reliance on dictatorial
                                methods to achieve his aims, his ineptitude in gauging political and
                                social forces and his consequent grave shortcomings as a political
                                leader, his proneness to meddle in military actions, his basic
                                suspicion of all other potential Chinese leaders, and his
                                inclination to carry on Machiavellian politics in the domestic arena
                                without due regard to the overall effect of such maneuvers on the
                                country as a whole.</p>
                            <p>The removal of General Chiang Kai-shek by the United States would be
                                an exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible task. With his position
                                substantially strengthened as a result of developments in Korea, it
                                is doubtful that he could be induced voluntarily to resign. Any
                                effort of the U.S. Government to remove him forcibly and set up a
                                succession would be difficult to carry out and would taint his
                                successor as a U.S. puppet. There would further be the possibility
                                that any change in leadership at Taipei, if effected through the use
                                of force, would introduce an element of disorder in the Formosan
                                situation which would work to the benefit of the Communists on the
                                mainland.</p>
                            <p>In those circumstances it would appear advisable that the U.S. view
                                sympathetically and covertly support the development of any
                                resistance movement on the mainland in as much as such a movement
                                would be both a potential threat against the Peiping regime and
                                would be a natural influence exercising pressure on the National
                                Government on Formosa to adopt more effective policies. Such
                                resistance movement might in due course become more important for
                                the rallying of anti-Communist support of the Chinese people than
                                the recognized National Government on Formosa. In the meantime, it
                                is believed that the U.S. should continue support to the National
                                Government on Formosa, avoiding any commitment of U.S. strength or
                                prestige to the return of that Government to the mainland and
                                leaving to the Chinese the question of any change in Governmental
                                leadership. At the same time we should use our political influence
                                and the leverage of American aid to strengthen those military and
                                political leaders on Formosa who seem worthy of confidence. American
                                support should in so far as possible not be identified with Chiang
                                Kai-shek as such, but with the National Government.</p>
                            <p>Reaction in Eastern countries to this policy would probably be
                                divided along the lines of recognition policy toward Peiping. In the
                                Philippines our action in supporting the National Government would
                                    <pb n="1577" xml:id="pg_1577" facs="0119"/>be seen for what it
                                is—making the best of a bad situation—and while our action would
                                evoke little enthusiasm we would probably receive more support than
                                criticism. It is believed the Philippines would consider our support
                                of the National Government a lesser evil than our abandonment of it
                                and loss of Formosa to the Communists. The Associated States and
                                Thailand have little concern in what happens to Formosa except in so
                                far as developments there affect Chinese Communist military pressure
                                on their own borders. Japan, for security reasons, might well be
                                expected to support those moves which would have as end result the
                                denial of Formosa to Communist control, and would presumably be more
                                interested in the first instance in the effectiveness of the means
                                adopted than in the means per se.</p>
                            <p>The Eastern countries which have recognized the Peiping regime,
                                namely, India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan, may be
                                expected to criticize, if not actively oppose, continued U.S.
                                support of the National Government. India exercises a large measure
                                of influence in these countries, with the exception of Pakistan.
                                India, which for the most part follows Nehru’s personal
                                interpretation of Far Eastern developments, has already advocated
                                turning over Formosa to the Chinese Communists and may be expected
                                actively to oppose U.S. support of the National Government. This
                                attitude probably arises in part from Nehru’s belief that Mao
                                expresses the new spirit of Asia while Chiang Kai-shek does not; in
                                part from Nehru’s desire to be proven right in his opinion that the
                                National Government is wholly discredited and finished in China; and
                                in part because he fancies that such an attitude helps his standing
                                at Peiping and strengthens his position as a “peacemaker”. It is not
                                believed that under present conditions Indian opposition to U.S.
                                support of Formosa would be substantially lessened even though a
                                change were made in the top Chinese leadership on the Island. If
                                such a change occurred as a result of direct U.S. intervention,
                                Indian opposition might, indeed, be increased rather than decreased
                                thereby. In short, India wants Formosa turned over to Communist
                                China—and is likely, in present circumstances, to oppose any course
                                of action that we may take to prevent this. Indonesia, which is
                                strongly influenced by India, would probably have the same attitude.
                                Ceylon, Burma and Pakistan would oppose U.S. support to the National
                                Government but probably much less vigorously than would India and
                                Indonesia. The support of the aforementioned East Asian countries of
                                the Peiping regime, and their opposition to U.S. support of the
                                National Government on Formosa, would alike probably increase in
                                direct ratio to their favorable appreciation of the political and
                                economic acts of the Chinese Communists and their parallel
                                unfavorable appreciation of the moral and political standing <pb
                                    n="1578" xml:id="pg_1578" facs="0120"/>of the National
                                Government. Any turn in events, however, which might cause a
                                depreciation of the standing of the Peiping regime and/or
                                appreciation of the position of the National Government or of a
                                mainland resistance movement would presumably bring about changes in
                                their respective political positions. The growth of a Chinese
                                Communist threat of aggression against Southeast Asia and South
                                Asia, for one thing, could logically be expected to result in some
                                change in the attitudes of the nations under threat.</p>
                            <p>Although we should continue to support the National Government on
                                Formosa, we should not, in view of the indifferent support which
                                Chiang Kai-shek has received in the past and receives still from the
                                Chinese people, and the many political obstacles arising from his
                                complete defeat on the mainland, place principal reliance on him to
                                lead an opposition movement within China.</p>
                            <p>It is assumed that our basic objective within China is to further the
                                development of active resistance to the Chinese Communists to the
                                end that a vigorous opposition movement may emerge capable of
                                progressively challenging Communist control. It is believed that the
                                fall of Formosa would be disheartening to actual and potential
                                resistance groups. To the extent that denial of Formosa to the
                                Communists is helped by our support of the National Government, this
                                support likewise contributes to our objectives on the mainland.
                                However, it would likewise be discouraging to mainland opposition
                                groups were they to be convinced that U.S. policy was directed
                                solely toward the return of Chiang and his <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                    >KMT</gloss> Government to the mainland. If all U.S. assistance
                                were funneled through Chiang, he would become in Chinese eyes the
                                chosen and exclusive U.S. instrument for contesting Communist
                                control on the mainland. We should avoid a course of action which
                                would lead to this conclusion. … In an environment of Communist
                                repression, we should expect a process of natural selection and
                                survival of the fittest to eliminate the weak and bring the
                                strongest to the top. By this essentially Chinese process, we should
                                expect the leadership of any unified opposition movement to evolve.
                                Similarly, while we should work for the ultimate merging of mainland
                                and Formosan opposition forces, the terms of such merger and the
                                part, if any, which Chiang and associates would have in any unified
                                opposition movement is a Chinese problem in which we might intervene
                                only at grave risk.</p>

                            warfare alone cannot be made. The discussions of the probable Chinese
                            Communist reaction to each of the proposed courses of action and its
                            probable effects are plausible enough but avail info is not sufficient
                            to warrant their acceptance as conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Our sponsorship of guerrilla activity would result in neutralizing to

                                xml:id="pg_1580" facs="0122"/>however, that any large scale
                            defection of Communist troops or citizens will take place until it is
                            believed that the Nationalists have a good chance of remaining on the
                            mainland. It is doubtful that this condition of mind can be created
                            until a major force has gained a lodgement there. Unless the attainment
                            of short range objectives (particularly the prevention of employment of
                            Chinese Communist Forces in areas contiguous to China) is considered of
                            paramount importance, resort to guerrilla warfare might possibly result
                            in dissipation of the asset we now have in the Chinese Nationalist
                            Forces to the detriment of longer range objectives.</p>
                        <p>The development of guerrilla potential into guerrilla power is time
                            consuming. However, particularly where Comm are primitive, and in the
                            event case 5 is being given favorable consideration at the national
                            level, it might be well as a prelude to project the immediate
                            implementation of case 3. In this connection the Chinese have in the
                            past shown a susceptibility to rendering service to the highest bidder
                            and while the US cannot openly engage in bribery to defection, it is
                            believed that the purchase of high Communist civ and mil officials might
                            prove an economical method of assisting in disestablishing the present
                            auth in China.</p>

                            Staff has, in anticipation of directives from the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
                            developed preliminary plans along the lines of case 5. Under this
                            concept, the US would provide air, naval and log support for a landing
                            of the Chinese Nationalist Forces. US Air and Naval Forces would protect
                            Formosa, freeing Chinese Nationalist Combat Forces for employment on the
                            mainland. It was est that shipping could be assembled for initial lift
                            of 100,000. The Shanghai area was selected for the principal landing.
                            The objective of opns ashore was the domination of South China behind
                            the protection of a defensive line along the Yangtze River. These
                            studies were, of course, oriented specifically to the Korean situation
                            rather than the broader objectives of Joint Chiefs of Staff 2118/15.</p>

                            assumed that this refers to Soviet participation in China alone and that
                            in the event of a gen war consideration would be given to the returns
                            which might be anticipated by the actions listed in the study.</p>

                            the Naval lift. 7,200 refugees were lifted in one Landing Ship Tank
                            during the evac from Hamhung. It is est that shipping could be assembled
                            within 2 months for an initial lift of 100,000 Chinese Nationalists.

                            survey report has been dlvrd. A basic factor is the time required for
                            log prep of the Chinese Nat Forces.</p>
                        <p>In summation, it is believed the Chinese Nat Forces should be equipped
                            along somewhat austere standards and trained for eventual employment on
                            the mainland. Recommendations contained in <gloss target="#t_FECFECOM1"

                            Forces which were oriented to the def of Formosa might require revision
                            in the light of their prospective employment on the mainland. Eventual
                            employment of the Chinese Nat Forces, when they are capable of eff
                            action, cannot now be predicted with finality. US identification with
                            guerrilla warfare should be a prelude to larger opns which have a
                            substantial prospect of overthrowing Communist auth in China, or
                            portions of it.</p>

                            level of Department. If we are going to employ publicity should be done
                            immediately before Chinese Communists put out fabricated version of
                            Wallace’s death.</p>

                        <p>Part 1. In event of Chinese Communist air or sea attacks against Formosa
                            or the Pescadores will the Chinese Nationalists Government be authorized
                            to retaliate immediately against targets on Chinese Mainland?</p>
                        <p>Part 2. In the event of Chinese Communist air or sea attacks against
                            Formosa or against United States Forces outside Korea, it is recommended
                            that Commander in Chief Far East be authorized to retaliate immediately
                            against targets on Chinese Mainland.</p>
                        <p>Part 3. The return of seasonal weather and sea conditions favorable to
                            attacks upon Formosa and the continuing capability of Chinese Communists
                            to mount air attacks outside Korea require early decisions upon the
                            above query and recommendation.</p>

                            missionary, Dr. Wallace. Second Party said that he had attempted to call
                            First Party on the preceding Friday evening<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2"
                                >February 23.</note> and had been unable to reach him. He was sure
                            that Third Party had not communicated the information. He said that at
                            the time the information had been passed on to Third Party, Third Party
                            explained that he had no way of communicating it and would wait until he
                            could get abroad to establish better communications before doing so.</p>
                        <p>First Party raised the general subject of Third Party’s veracity. Second
                            Party said that he was sure of it insofar as one can be sure of that
                            quality with respect to any Oriental. In general he was satisfied with
                            the good faith of Third Party.</p>
                        <p>First Party then communicated certain items on which information from
                            Third Party would be welcomed if obtainable. The questions referred to
                            in general the numbers and training locations of the Chinese pilots
                            previously reported by Third Party to be undergoing <pb n="1584"

                        <p>Second Party said he would call First Party Tuesday afternoon with the
                            answers. First Party advised Second Party not to press for the answers
                            but to work the way round to the questions easily. He suggested also
                            that Second Party seek further clarification as to the sources of Third
                            Party’s information regarding submarine and suicide pilot
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>First Party discussed the general situation and said this Government was
                            now in a fairly easy position as to alternative paths to be followed in
                            relation to the Chinese. A peaceful settlement was now something in a
                            take it or leave it category so far as this Government is concerned.
                            Accordingly, we still felt it a good idea to get Third Party to a point
                            from which he could make better contact with his principals but we
                            certainly did not think that urgency was of the essence.</p>

                                text.</note> are the latest items foreshadowing a massive
                            economic-military aid program which we are drifting into for Formosa.
                            Last year the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> program was about $25
                            million and the military aid program about $10 million. For fiscal 1952
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_SISA1"
                                >S/ISA</gloss> military program comes to $237 million with over $200
                            million additional tentatively projected for fiscal 1953.</p>
                        <p>The economic aid program for fiscal 1952 will run close to $100 million
                            unless I miss my guess. What is disturbing, however, is that the
                            groundwork is being laid by the Chinese and by <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> for “budgetary assistance” within the coming year with
                            the alternative “economic collapse”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SISA1">S/ISA</gloss> is shooting for a March 1
                            deadline for clearance of the Formosa military aid figure. They won’t
                            meet it, but the pressure is on us.</p>
                        <p>Having set our foot on the road we are on, I am inclined to think that we
                            are in no position to contest a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            estimate of the cost of a program designed to make the Island militarily
                            defensible. Similarly, I believe we are in little better position
                            seriously to contest an <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> estimate of
                            what may be required to keep Formosa economically healthy and enable it
                            to absorb the impact of a massive military aid program.</p>
                        <p>I believe, however, that we owe it to the Department and the taxpayer to
                            take a good hard look at the total price tag which I estimate will run
                            over $400 million for fiscal 1952. On a per capita basis a comparable
                            economic-military aid program for Japan would run about $5 billion a
                            year.</p>

                            be. The question was not answered directly but the reply indicated that
                            the Chinese expect raids on the island of Formosa particularly Quinmen.
                            They emphasized the superiority of Red Chinese air over their own air
                            and the readiness of his airfields in the provinces adjacent to Formosa
                            Straits. They anticipate early air raids on Formosa and requested
                            assistance in connection with the present radar procurement. Com 7th
                            Fleet recommends that increased priority be assigned to current Chinese
                            radar procurement.</p>
                        <p>They presented their views on the necessity of their being able to take
                            prompt action against the Red Chinese airfields and invasion buildup
                            before the enemys forces actually had commenced an invasion. More

                            Communist air or sea attack against Formosa or the Pescadores, no
                            objection will be interposed to Chinese Nat Govt retaliating immediately
                            against targets on the Chinese mainland. This position will be conveyed
                            to Chinese Nat Govt through dipl channels.</p>
                        <p>2. In event of Chinese Communist air or sea attacks against United States
                            forces outside Korea, the principle of immediate retaliation against
                            targets on Chinese mainland is approved. However, subject to right of
                            immediate self-defense, you will inform us of facts concerning the
                            Chinese Communist attack and receive approval of your proposed
                            retaliatory action prior to attacking targets on Chinese mainland.</p>
                        <p>3. It is not contemplated that retaliation would follow in case of
                            Chinese Communist attacks upon United States or Chinese Nationalist
                            reconnaissance aircraft flying over or in immediate vicinity of Chinese

                        <p>Second Party said Third Party is most anxious to travel to London as soon
                            as possible. He said Third Party believes that important communications
                            have been forwarded to him in London in the belief that he would have
                            been there long before this time. He said Third Party had received no
                            recent communications from his principals in Peiping—at least this is
                            what Third Party had imparted to Second Party and Second Party believes
                            it.</p>

                        <p>Third Party was quoted as giving the opinion that Mao Tse-tung is being
                            held in duress by the Stalinists. He believes that Li Li-sen<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d45fn1">Li Li-san, Minister of Labor, People’s Republic of

                            thoroughly in charge of the Peiping situation. This is based on no
                            particular word from Peiping but from his sense of the situation as
                            related to what he reads in the papers. He believes that the prospect of
                            a deviation of the Peiping Government from the Kremlin line has now
                            become impossible and that the only course to break Peiping away must be
                            a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi>. He believes that the time for this
                            is near at hand if not already at hand.</p>
                        <p>Third Party believes that the critical questions will soon be not as to
                            whether or how to encourage a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi> but how
                            to establish working relations for assisting the régime to come into
                            existence as a result of a <hi rend="italic">coup d’etat</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Second Party had questioned Third Party regarding dispositions and
                            numbers of submarine preparations along the lines of the questions in
                            the memorandum of conversation of February 26, 1951. He had approached
                            this by indirection. It was apparent to him that Third Party had no
                            specific or recent information regarding the training of submarine crews
                            in China. Third Party had made references in conversations to Hainan and
                            expressed his assurity that use was being made of the former Japanese
                            naval base there. Third Party had been blank, however, on the question
                            regarding the crew of the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Chungking</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Second Party said Third Party emphasized that a very great impetus to a
                            division on the mainland could be gained at this time by a political
                            reorientation on Formosa eliminating Chiang Kai-shek from the primary
                                position.<note n="2" xml:id="d45fn2">The file includes memoranda of
                                four subsequent conversations between First Party and Second Party
                                between March 20 and April 26. They dealt primarily with Third
                                Party’s efforts to obtain a visa to visit the United Kingdom or
                                Switzerland in order to establish communication with his principals
                                and, perhaps, to return to China; there was some discussion of the
                                possibility that Second Party might go to Switzerland in order to
                                maintain a channel of communication between Third Party and the
                                Department (S/P Files: Lot 64 D 563). The series concludes with the
                                April 26 memorandum, but see Marshall’s memorandum of conversation,

                            Year 1952.</p>
                        <p>I refer to the Department of Defense estimate that $237.7 million will be
                            required to furnish military assistance for the defense of Formosa
                            during Fiscal Year 1952.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State recognizes that the situation of Formosa in
                            relation to the over-all Far Eastern problem makes impossible the
                            precise prediction of Fiscal Year 1952 military aid needs for both that
                            island and other countries in the area.</p>
                        <p>The instability of the political and military situation in the Far East
                            is such that unpredictable operational and program requirements for the
                            armed forces of the countries in this area might emerge on very short
                            notice. Priorities of country programs as well as adjustments among
                            these programs must be subjected to changes to meet developments
                            affecting the security interests of the United States. Therefore, the
                            funds being requested to meet the military aid needs of the countries in
                            the Far East area, including Formosa, should be allocated and dedicated
                            to specific country programs in light of United States political and
                            military interests at the time.</p>
                        <p>On the basis of this understanding, the Department of State agrees to the
                            budgetary programs of military aid in the amount of $584.0 million for
                            the Far Eastern countries, including $237.7 million for Formosa. The
                            phasing and magnitude of the funds programmed for budgetary purposes
                            will, at a later date, be considered jointly by the two Departments and
                            decided on the basis of a review of the situation at the time.</p>

                        <p>I was called over to the office of Mr. Forbes in <gloss target="#t_SISA1"
                                >S/ISA</gloss> this morning to discuss with Major Ruth Briggs (a

                            Forbes is, I believe, the individual in <gloss target="#t_SISA1"
                                >S/ISA</gloss> immediately responsible for <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> operations; Major Briggs appears to have considerable
                            authority within the Office of the Secretary of Defense in such matters.
                            She seemed very well informed of Defense procedures in connection with
                            advisory and training assistance and fully apprised of Defense, <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                >CINCFE</gloss> thinking with regard to Formosa operations.</p>
                        <p>For background, Major Briggs commenced by showing me a copy of a top
                            secret telegram from <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> (as I
                            recall, dated March 8)<note n="1" xml:id="d48fn1">The reference is
                                apparently to telegram C 57381 from <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                    >CINCFE</gloss> to the Department of the Army, January 19, 1951.
                                At the time, the telegram was not circulated to the Department of
                                State; a copy has been received from the Department of Defense and
                                placed in file 794A.5 MAP/1–1951.</note> in which General MacArthur
                            expressed for the information of Defense his frank views on the subject
                            of Formosa advisory personnel. To my knowledge this telegram was never
                            distributed to the Department (Major Briggs remarked that this
                            information was being furnished me informally for background purposes
                            only; under the circumstances I could, of course, take no notes
                            regarding this telegram or subsequent remarks). General MacArthur
                            concedes in this telegram that the State Department and Minister Rankin
                            have a legitimate interest in <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss>
                            operations on Formosa, but adds that under the present circumstances
                            (i.e., with Formosa under his military command and the invasion threat
                            increasing) he believes that there should be a direct chain of command
                            through <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> to <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> with respect to Formosa military

                                    and training, should be via purely military channels from the

                            </note> General MacArthur then outlines his views regarding the
                            complement for training and (advisory personnel for the island, to the
                            best of my recollection, as follows:</p>
                        <p>The most essential requirement is for approximately 270 individuals to be
                            assigned to Formosa immediately to furnish technical advice and
                            assistance to the Nationalist armed forces in the repair and
                            rehabilitation of existing equipment. A second group of approximately
                            100 individuals would be required to provide administrative services:
                            PX, medical, quartermaster, etc. Finally, an additional complement would
                            be required to provide customary <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            services, i.e., checking military aid shipments on receipt, control of
                            distribution, and continuing end-use checks. This group would also be
                            responsible for <pb n="1593" xml:id="pg_1593" facs="0135"/>training the
                            Chinese Navy and Air Force, and the Chinese Army “down to the battalion
                            level”. Although General MacArthur gave no figure for the complement of
                            the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> group, Major Briggs remarked
                            that Defense had arrived at a tentative figure of 132. I cannot be sure
                            of these figures without a further opportunity to check, but recall
                            clearly that the total, as we figured it during this meeting, came to
                            almost exactly 500.</p>
                        <p>After reading this telegram and noting the progress which Defense has
                            apparently made in <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> planning, I
                            mentioned briefly to Major Briggs <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>’s
                            inclination to prefer an expanded attaché staff as suggested by the
                            Embassy and attachés. Major Briggs brushed this suggestion aside
                            hastily, indicating that as far as Defense is concerned matters have
                            already gone far beyond the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                            >MAAG</gloss>-attaché staff debate stage. I soon realized what she
                            meant. In conformance with General MacArthur’s views (as expressed in
                            the telegram mentioned above) and “the practicalities of the situation”,
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> appears to have already
                            considered and discarded the customary concept of a <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> (in which the Ambassador has major
                            responsibilities) for a more complicated arrangement which would provide
                            General MacArthur virtually complete freedom of action in the field. To
                            illustrate the inapplicability of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> procedure to the Formosa situation, Major Briggs with
                            a chuckle asked how General MacArthur would like it if he had to clear
                            with Mr. Rankin whenever he wished to detail new personnel to Formosa.
                            Major Briggs then showed me a top secret <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> paper setting forth the recommendation that the old

                            mainland <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> organization has
                            never been completely abolished. Although all the <gloss
                                target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> personnel were reassigned, the
                            structure of the organization remains in effect today. The <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal, as I recall it, was that a
                                <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> staff be appointed, to
                            have charge under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> of the
                            customary <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> (supervising end-use)
                            and also the training group recommended by General MacArthur.</p>
                        <p>Major Briggs pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            suggestion is obviously impracticable, since a conflicting chain of
                            command is involved. The <pb n="1594" xml:id="pg_1594" facs="0136"
                            />customary <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> procedure gives the
                            Ambassador the final authority in questions of policy as well as
                            important administrative matters; yet under the procedures suggested by
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> would be part of a <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1"
                                >JUSMAG</gloss> operation and subject to the <gloss
                                target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> commander’s desires. Major Briggs
                            said that she had been assigned to work out a more practical procedure.
                            She has two alternatives to propose: (1) a “double-header” operation,
                            involving a separate <gloss target="#t_JUSMAG1">JUSMAG</gloss> group
                            responsible directly to General MacArthur, to handle training questions,
                            and a <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> group, which would conform
                            with European <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> patterns with
                            certain changes circumscribing the Ambassador’s powers; and (2) a single
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> establishment handling both
                            training and end-use functions, but in no way comparable to <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> groups established elsewhere. The
                            Ambassador’s clearance would no longer be required in recommendations
                            submitted by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officer on
                            Formosa to <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> through <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>; the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> officer would keep the Ambassador informed by
                            furnishing him copies of all communications, giving him an opportunity
                            to concur or comment. It could be expected, she added, that General
                            MacArthur would insist on the right to communicate directly with <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on Formosa military matters, and that
                            his recommendations would be received and considered in Washington
                            without prior clearance either by the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> officer or the Ambassador. General MacArthur would,
                            however, be instructed to keep Taipei informed of his actions by
                            transmitting copies of telegrams and correspondence.</p>
                        <p>She thus seems to have two propositions in mind for the Formosa chain of
                            command: The first one involves two separate military organizations on
                            Formosa, one responsible directly to General MacArthur and the other
                            technically responsible to the Ambassador in certain respects, but with
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> having a veto power; the
                            second involves a single organization, with the Ambassador free to
                            advise and comment but with the final authority residing in the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                >CINCFE</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> chain of
                            command. Under both alternatives, the Embassy would be removed from the
                            scene as far as any real responsibility in military questions is
                            concerned. Major Briggs <hi rend="italic">did</hi> concede that the
                            Department of State in Washington might have a certain amount of say in
                            policy questions, but warned me that a close working relationship would
                            have to be established between State and Defense, lest the “political
                            desk” unduly delay or impede action on military matters.</p>
                        <p>My sole reaction to all this was to remark that I believed my office
                            favored the maintenance of a single, well integrated chain of command on
                            Formosa, headed by the official US representative to the Chinese
                            Government viz: the Ambassador. I drew her attention to the difficulties
                            which would arise if there were a double chain of command on Formosa,
                            with the Chinese using both the Embassy and the military <pb n="1595"
                                xml:id="pg_1595" facs="0137"/>for all they were worth. Finally, I
                            repeated that we were by no means convinced that even a standard <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, with much of the authority residing
                            in the Embassy, would be appropriate for Formosa. This argument appeared
                            to make little impression on Major Briggs. She informed me, to my
                            surprise, that Admiral Jarrett has already been designated acting <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officer on Formosa, and that a
                            permanent <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officer has been
                            nominated (but not as yet fully approved in Defense). He is, as I recall
                            General William Curtis Chase, presently on the staff of the Third Army.
                            According to Major Briggs, General Chase is to visit Tokyo in the near
                            future to discuss with General MacArthur the arrangements outlined in
                            the foregoing, in order that a procedure may be devised which fits his
                            wishes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Forbes’ position was for the most part neutral. He asked me what
                            “political considerations” were involved in these alternatives, and
                            expressed general agreement with my comments regarding the desirability
                            of a unified chain of command. But he also remarked that under the
                            existing circumstances, it appeared logical to give <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> a considerable degree of
                            authority regarding military operations on the island, since Formosa is
                            within his military sphere of responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Major Briggs asked me to discuss these alternatives within <gloss
                                target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and to furnish her, through Mr. Forbes,
                            an expression of the Department’s views as to the appropriate chain of
                            command for the US military aid organization on Formosa. She asked that
                            if possible we make this information available by the end of this
                            week.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It seems somewhat strange to me that far reaching <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> plans for the control of Formosa military aid would be
                            put to the Department so informally and at a working level. Major Briggs
                            told me that she had been assigned the task of planning a practical
                            military aid organization for the island, and I assume that the reason
                            for her approach to the Department at this stage was to obtain
                            suggestions and ideas as to what form of organization would be
                            acceptable here. Her recommendations would not, of course, represent the
                            final word, and it is possible that her tentative plans do not
                            accurately reflect <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> thinking. From
                            her remarks I would judge that her relationship with the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> staff on matters of this sort is close.
                            I would also judge that she has been working closely with <gloss
                                target="#t_SISA1">S/ISA</gloss> for a considerable period of time on
                            military aid personnel planning. In any event, I believe her remarks
                            (and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> documents she showed me) are of
                            considerable interest, indicating the trend of thought in at least one
                            sector of the Department of Defense. I gained the general impression
                            from our discussion (which lasted almost an hour and a half) that <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> is determined to tailor the US military
                            aid organization <pb n="1596" xml:id="pg_1596" facs="0138"/>for Formosa
                            to fit General Mac Arthur’s own desires, regardless of the effect which
                            such a procedure may have on the traditional responsibilities of an
                            ambassador in a recipient <gloss target="#t_MDA1">MDA</gloss> country.
                            She referred repeatedly to what the General wanted and “would probably
                            do”, with never a hint that <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would
                            take the initiative in establishing a generally acceptable chain of
                            command.</p>
                        <p>If we continue to believe that military assistance should be administered
                            as part of our foreign policy, it may be that a word to that effect to
                            Major Briggs and her bosses would be in order at this time. Otherwise,
                            plans of this sort are likely to progress to the point where they are
                            difficult to alter.</p>

                            to the policy framework within which this Government should approach the
                            interrelated problems of <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and <gloss

                            Formosa. I am putting in this letter a statement of the policy guide
                            lines which we think should govern <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                            planning and operations during the remainder of Fiscal 1951 and during
                            1952. The principle contained in paragraph 5 is one which will, of
                            course, require study and comment by Defense, but before that is done
                            State and <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> should, I believe, arrange
                            to have a full exchange of views on the whole range of problems arising
                            from our aid programs for Formosa which we are apt to be facing in the

                            <p>6. Although Communist China is largely self-sufficient in food and
                                hard fuel, she is dependent upon sea imports in excess of 97 per
                                cent of petroleum requirements and a large percentage of many other
                                materials vital to the economy. China is a country of great
                                distances, limited interior lines of communications and with few
                                land outlets to the outside world. As China’s coal and food are
                                produced in certain areas only, distribution is dependent on inland
                                waterways, coastwise shipping and the limited railroad net.
                                Therefore, if these means of transport are disrupted, the entire
                                distribution system will collapse and large areas will be denied
                                many of the essentials of life.</p>

                                    Present Time:</hi> General MacArthur has U.S. naval amphibious
                                lift for 0.4 combat loaded army divisions. An additional 0.3
                                division lift is now available in the Pacific. A total lift for 1.0
                                divisions could be provided within about two months. However,
                                considerable additional lift could be utilized, especially for short
                                hauls such as from Japan to Korea, or from Formosa to China, by the
                                use of excess World War II vessels now in Japan, by utilizing all
                                types of cargo, coastal and other vessels, and by increasing ship
                                lift in accordance with oriental standards. It is estimated that
                                amphibious lift for 100,000 Nationalist troops could be assembled in
                                two months.</p>
                            <p>8. It is believed that Soviet decision to engage in open war with the
                                United States (United Nations) will be predicated on the Soviet
                                concept of the proper time to do so, which may, of course, be either
                                hastened or delayed by U.S. removal of current restrictions on
                                Nationalist China but which probably will not be precipitated by it
                                per se.</p>
                            <p>9. The peoples of Asia will be greatly influenced by their judgment
                                as to the probable outcome of any action against the Chinese
                                Communist regime and will be reluctant to commit themselves to take
                                sides, and more particularly, to align themselves with a probable
                                loser. Successful overt action against the Chinese Communist regime
                                would <pb n="1600" xml:id="pg_1600" facs="0142"/>invoke favorable
                                reactions in most of the non-Communist Asiatic nations, though
                                little material aid could be expected from them. There are at
                                present non-Communist governments in Indochina, Malaya, Siam, Burma,
                                Formosa, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines.
                                These governments and the anti-Communist element among their peoples
                                would be encouraged in their own efforts against communism by strong
                                action against Communist China. The anti-Communist elements and
                                guerrilla forces on the mainland of China would also be encouraged
                                and motivated to positive action. India, however, though
                                non-Communist, could be expected to condemn any overt action against
                                the Chinese Communist regime. Nehru recognized the Chinese Communist
                                Government, would oppose any extension of hostilities, and would
                                particularly condemn U.S. aid and assistance to the Chinese
                                Nationalists because he opposes any participation by the “white man”
                                in Asian affairs.</p>
                            <p>10. There is evidence to indicate that a substantial part of the
                                Chinese people are thoroughly disillusioned with the Chinese
                                Communist regime, and it is estimated that about 700,000 are engaged
                                in active resistance operations, ranging from local banditry to
                                organized guerrilla warfare.</p>
                            <p>11. Although the Communists were formerly welcomed by many Chinese as
                                the lesser of two evils, another switch in allegiance by those same
                                Chinese would not be unlikely. For example, the actual benefits to
                                the farmer resulting from the agrarian reform have been considerably
                                smaller than the Communist propaganda line would indicate. While he
                                has been gaining land to farm without high rentals, the tax in the
                                form of confiscation of a large part of his production has left the
                                farmer with approximately the same net result as heretofore.</p>
                            <p>12. Nationalist troops have undergone extensive and prolonged
                                training, but, due to inept leadership and poor living conditions,
                                there is some question of their morale. Knowledge that they were
                                receiving full-fledged aid from the United States would provide a
                                tremendous lift to morale. It is highly probable that, provided with
                                effective leadership, modern equipment, and logistic support, they
                                could be brought to a point of efficiency equal to that of the
                                average of the Chinese Communist Army. The use of Chinese
                                Nationalist Forces in any war with Communist China would be most
                                desirable from a military viewpoint. They constitute the only
                                immediately available ground forces for use on the mainland of
                                China, and their acceptance and use would inspire hope among
                                millions of non-Communist Chinese on the mainland of China and
                                non-Communist sympathizers throughout Asia. An increase in the tempo
                                of guerrilla activity and sabotage within <pb n="1601"

                                while, at the same time, the threat of Nationalist landings on the
                                China coast would prevent further <gloss target="#t_CCF1"

                                transfer to Manchuria and Korea. Furthermore, this trend combined
                                with possible large-scale guerrilla activity in Kwangsi and Yunnan
                                would materially reduce pressure on Hong Kong and Macao, and reduce
                                support of the Viet Minh.</p>
                            <p>13. Chinese Nationalists have an excellent system of intelligence in
                                the central coast areas of China, the accuracy of which has been
                                frequently verified. However, their means of obtaining intelligence
                                elsewhere is extremely limited. Therefore, it is considered that if
                                augmented by U.S. air and naval intelligence, it would not be likely
                                for the Communists to trap any Nationalist landing force on the
                                mainland due to surprise action.</p>
                            <p>14. In the light of past experience and present conditions in the
                                Chinese Nationalist military command, it is considered that the
                                establishment of a Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group is mandatory
                                in the event of further U.S. logistical support to ensure that:
                                supplies are not misappropriated, troops are properly fed and paid,
                                equipment is properly maintained and utilized. Such a group should
                                have representation down to the battalion level, and in time may
                                require about 2,000 officers and men for full implementation. In
                                addition, the magnitude of our aid should be used as a lever by the
                                head of the group to ensure that operational advice is accepted.</p>
                            <p>15. Areas of operation on the Chinese mainland suitable for
                                Nationalist attack contain few vital objectives. Fukien Province,
                                directly opposite Formosa, is wild, mountainous, semi-tropical, and
                                sparsely populated in comparison with the rest of China. The bulk of
                                the people live on the coastline, where fishing is a major industry.
                                The interior is infested with bandits, who will fight on any side
                                which pays them. This area is suitable for the establishment of a
                                guerrilla operating base. From such a base, underground control and
                                supply lines to the north, west, and east could be maintained to
                                other guerrilla groups.</p>
                            <p>16. To the south, the Crown Colony of Hong Kong, with British
                                sensitivity, its trade and traffic, makes any overt operation by the
                                Nationalists in the Canton area undesirable initially.</p>
                            <p>17. To the north stands Shanghai, at the mouth of the Yangtse River.
                                From the city, south for about 100 miles, the coastline contains
                                good beaches, and is protected by numerous offshore islands. Just
                                south of Shanghai is one of the largest airbases in China.
                                Furthermore, the area inland, between the Yangtse and Yellow Rivers,
                                is the <pb n="1602" xml:id="pg_1602" facs="0144"/>rice bowl of
                                China. Thus, this area is suitable for a large-scale lodgment or for
                                commando type raids.</p>
                            <p>18. Amphibious operations by the Nationalists against the mainland
                                south of Canton and north of Shanghai are not considered feasible
                                due to logistical problems, and the danger of annihilation.</p>
                            <p>19. In view of the foregoing, the probable military effectiveness of
                                the Chinese Nationalist forces in operations against the mainland is
                                considered under five different cases below. In this connection, the
                                element of Soviet participation has been excluded. Should overt
                                participation occur at any time, our entire course of action in the
                                Far East would be immediately altered to one of strategic defense,
                                due to actual or threatened general war. In this case, the use of
                                Chinese Nationalist Forces on the mainland of China would depend on
                                the degree of direct Soviet participation within China, and our own
                                ability to assist with either matériel or supporting forces. Soviet
                                covert participation, probably by air and naval units only, would
                                correspondingly reduce Nationalist overt effectiveness, but would
                                not seriously impair Nationalist covert capabilities.</p>

                                are both removed; the present Military Aid Program (MAP) is
                                continued, but no additional logistical support is given the
                                Nationalists. In this case, nearly the entire Nationalist strength
                                will be required for defense of Formosa, and nothing more than a few
                                small harassing raids by air and sea could be attempted. Raids by
                                ground troops would be subject to the principal danger of defection,
                                and in any event, Formosa would probably fall within a year.</p>

                                the Nationalists are removed; the present MAP is continued, but no
                                additional logistical support is given the Nationalists. In this
                                case, the Nationalists could spare approximately 150,000 troops from
                                the defense of Formosa, but transport and resupply problems would
                                probably limit mainland operations to the establishment of one or
                                two small guerrilla bases in Fukien Province, and scattered
                                large-scale raids of not over 10,000 men each. These raids could
                                remain ashore one to three weeks, depending on the time required for
                                the Communist Chinese to muster sufficient ground forces to defeat
                                the beachhead. The principal military effect would be to force the
                                Communists to station additional troops, possibly as many as
                                200,000, in the vulnerable coastal areas.</p>

                                    facs="0145"/>the United States. In this case, an additional
                                Nationalist capability would be created. They could probably
                                accelerate the tempo, increase the combat effectiveness and widen
                                the area of guerrilla activity with logistical support. With outside
                                leadership, organization and bonuses, they could probably improve
                                cohesion and control, and enlarge the guerrilla force somewhat. The
                                principal military effect would be active guerrilla warfare
                                throughout the provinces of Chekiang, Fukien, Kwangsi and eastern
                                Kwantung. Probable subsidiary effects would be: a disruption of the
                                coastwise shipping (junk); harassment of mainland fishing fleets;
                                destruction of Communist military depots in the area designed to
                                support attack on Formosa; and disruption of the economies of
                                Fuchow, Amoy, and Swatow, the principal economic centers of the
                                area.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">d. Case IV</hi>. The same as Case III above, but
                                additional logistical support in the form of rations, supplemental
                                pay, individual equipment, to include expanded supplies and
                                incentive bonuses for guerrillas, are furnished by the United
                                States. In addition, a full-scale Joint Military Advisory Group down
                                to battalion level would be mandatory, as noted in paragraph 14
                                above. In Case III, in addition to capabilities noted above, the
                                Nationalists could maintain several large-scale guerrilla bases in
                                Fukien Province. In coordination with amphibious operations, they
                                could probably retake and hold certain Kwangsi air strips by use of
                                guerrillas presently in the area, and thereby open an air route to
                                Yunnan Province. Thus, widespread guerrilla activity could be
                                fostered in an area which has always been difficult for the central
                                government to control, which is important as being on the
                                Indochinese border, and which contains one of the largest airports
                                in China, at Kunming. They could probably, by a combination of
                                guerrilla and overt operations, keep the rail and coastwise shipping
                                in a state of disruption. Since the principal rail lines throughout
                                China could be cut from time to time, and since the distribution of
                                food and other necessities in many areas depends largely on rail
                                traffic, this action would require the utilization of additional
                                thousands of <gloss target="#t_CCF1">CCF</gloss> troops for security
                                duty throughout China. They could probably make landings of
                                10,000–15,000 troops and remain ashore for from one to eight weeks,
                                or perhaps indefinitely in small mobile groups, depending upon the
                                Communist Chinese ability to muster forces to dislodge them. This
                                would be affected in large part by the aid which they receive
                                ashore. However, it cannot be expected that any large-scale
                                defections of Communist troops or even civilians will take place
                                until it is believed that the Nationalists have a good chance of
                                remaining ashore and expanding their bridgehead. Unless the USSR
                                should withdraw support of Communist China, this would probably not
                                take place for a long period of <pb n="1604" xml:id="pg_1604"
                                    facs="0146"/>time, except as noted under Case V, below. The
                                principal effect of this course would be to sow the seeds of
                                rebellion which might in the long-term succeed in overthrowing the
                                Communist Chinese Government, but in the short-term would preoccupy
                                perhaps a third of the <gloss target="#t_CCF1">CCF</gloss>
                                first-line troops, in addition to an estimated one-third of the
                                total of <gloss target="#t_CCF1">CCF</gloss> second-line troops
                                currently considered engaged against guerrillas on the mainland of
                                China.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">e. Case V</hi>. The same as Case IV, except that
                                active support to landing operations is given by U.S. air and naval
                                units. In this case, not only would the scope of guerrilla
                                operations be greatly expanded, but the overt aid given by U.S.
                                armed forces would indicate that the Nationalist beachheads would be
                                supported, retained, and enlarged. With reasonable security against
                                reprisal, large numbers of defections from Communist troops and the
                                citizenry could be expected. The extent to which a massive landing
                                (involving initially 150,000 troops without endangering Formosa)
                                would succeed, and how well it could eventually maintain itself from
                                mainland sources, is a matter of speculation. However, the chances
                                for eventual complete collapse of the Communist Chinese Government
                                are definitely present. In any event, the effectiveness of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CCF1">CCF</gloss> would be reduced (and the
                                threat to peripheral areas correspondingly minimized) in direct
                                proportion to the effort and zeal invested in this undertaking.</p>
                            <p>20. Active operations under the conditions of Cases I, II, and III
                                can be initiated almost at once. However, three to six months would
                                be required before major operations could be carried out under the
                                conditions of Cases IV and V.</p>
                            <p>21. The military effectiveness of the use of Chinese forces on
                                Formosa against the mainland of China will be in direct proportion
                                to the aid and guidance given by the United States. In short, the
                                Chinese Nationalists are not capable of continued overt activities
                                at this time without direct U.S. military support. Even with U.S.
                                air and naval support (Case V above), the ultimate success of
                                military operations on the mainland is questionable. It follows that
                                Chinese Nationalist forces should be equipped by <gloss
                                    target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> along somewhat austere standards,
                                but trained for eventual employment on the mainland. In the
                                meanwhile, U.S. identification with guerrilla warfare, either in
                                conjunction with Nationalist or independent efforts, should be a
                                prelude to larger overt operations using Chinese Nationalist forces
                                if such should appear practicable in the future.</p>
                            <p>22. The courses of action proposed in paragraph 9 of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 101/1 will have very little
                                immediate effect on our position in the Far East. However, if taken
                                in conjunction with the other courses of action now under
                                consideration for the Far East the combined results in <pb n="1605"
                                    xml:id="pg_1605" facs="0147"/>time may well: deny all of China
                                south of the Yellow River to Communism; eliminate Communist logistic
                                support in Indochina; disrupt the economy in the remainder of China;
                                banish the threat of armed aggression in other parts of Asia; reduce
                                the effectiveness of Communist Chinese military forces, and do much
                                to counter the myth of Communist invincibility throughout the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>23. In the consideration of Cases II, III, and IV and V above, the
                                Chinese Nationalist forces retained on Formosa are considered
                                adequate for the defense of that island. It is noted that in each of
                                these cases protection of Formosa by the 7th Fleet was assumed. If
                                such protection is removed (Case I) it is believed that the Chinese
                                Communists could conquer Formosa within a year.</p>

                            of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act, as amended. Since this proposed

                            running into 1953, a large part of which will require early action in
                            connection with the foreign aid authorization for 1952, it is believed
                            appropriate at this time to seek a review of our objectives in Formosa

                            as you know, called for a survey to determine the deficiencies of the
                            armed forces on the Island and, at the same time, to make a realistic
                            appraisal of their ability to repel a determined assault from the
                            mainland of China. This military survey, generally known as the Fox
                            Survey, has been completed.</p>

                            characteristics of these programs, it is believed desirable to clarify

                            every effort be made to expedite the consideration of this matter. In

                            we believe are required to satisfactorily review the pending allocation

                            least we should do in this circumstance is to undertake a probing for

                            raise the question of Korea and develop for our benefit Soviet thinking
                            regarding a negotiated settlement. Because the Russians are likely to be
                            more communicative if they think they are dealing only with us, as the
                            only other great power in the world, the discussion should be bilateral
                            rather than quadripartite. As the conversation should be on an informal
                            basis and so contrived that Lavrentiev takes the initiative, we need not
                            in advance of the event inform the British and French that we are
                            conducting this exploration. Only if the Soviet proposals look
                            attractive should the talks be raised to the Jessup-Gromyko level. We
                            can cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>

                            two enemies it is often profitable to play them off against one another.
                            To our discomfort we recognize that the Russians are doing just that
                            with respect to ourselves, the British and the French. Thus far we have
                            not consciously undertaken to do this in the case of the <pb n="1608"

                            be a good time to essay a beginning. Certainly the Korean conflict would

                            the Soviet Union and Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it is recommended that simultaneously we conduct an
                            exploratory operation towards the Chinese Communists seeking to elicit
                            from them their version of the terms on which they would settle the
                            Korean conflict. We may discover that they have the same terms which the
                            Kremlin offers us. If so, we will have acquired an interesting piece of
                            intelligence. If not we will have acquired an even more interesting
                            piece of intelligence—and an opportunity of major and far-reaching
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>There is no one in the Far East qualified and in a position to perform
                            this mission. It is therefore recommended that Mr. C. B. Marshall be
                            instructed to proceed to Hong Kong immediately for this purpose.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bert</hi>: Without instructions I tarn taking
                            certain action with regard to Tibet to which I hope the Department will
                            not take undue exception.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Henrig Harrer, Austrian tutor of the Dalai Lama, was brought in to
                            see me by Mr. James Burke of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Time</hi> magazines. Mr. Burke is getting some
                            important stories from Mr. Harrer and has been keeping him under cover
                            in New Delhi.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Harrer told me that the Dalai Lama is very much in need of advice. He
                            says the young man is much more intelligent and is better informed
                            regarding world affairs than any of his advisers. The Dalai Lama is also
                            deeply conscious of the need for social and other reforms in Tibet. He
                            trusts the United States more than any other country and <pb n="1611"
                                xml:id="pg_1611" facs="0153"/>has been disappointed in the ability
                                [<hi rend="italic">inability?</hi>] of Tibet to establish closer
                            relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>With great reluctance the Dalai Lama is sending the present mission to
                            Peking. He has not given this mission any plenipotentiary powers since
                            he fears that even though his brother-in-law is a member of the mission
                            that it might yield to pressure. The Dalai Lama has doubts about
                            returning to Lhasa. Some of the monks about him, however, insist that he
                            should come to terms with Peking and do so. The Dalai Lama does not know
                            which way to turn for advice.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to believe that Mr. Harrer is telling me the truth. Mr.
                            Burke, who has been carrying on long conversations with Mr. Harrer, also
                            believes in him. Mr. Burke knows necessarily part of this story and is
                            sworn to absolute secrecy.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that if the Dalai Lama goes back to Lhasa with his
                            treasures both he and his treasures will eventually fall into the hands
                            of the Chinese Communists. Furthermore, if he leaves his treasures in
                            Sikkim, where they are at present, I am afraid that the Government of
                            India will treat them in exactly the same way that they treated the
                            funds left in India in special accounts by the Nationalist Government of
                            China; that is, freeze them until the courts decide what is to be done
                            with them. The Dalai Lama is also very much afraid that at the last
                            moment the Indians will even refuse him asylum. According to Mr. Harrer,
                            the Government of India has thus far not promised to give the Dalai Lama
                            asylum. It seems that unless someone in whom this young man might have
                            confidence should give him advice, he will fall into the Chinese
                            Communist trap, or he will be in an extremely unenviable position in
                            India.</p>
                        <p>On my own initiative, therefore, I am endeavoring to send to the Dalai
                            Lama a message, a copy of which is attached. I am trying to send this
                            message by two channels: (1) I have given a copy to Latrash,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d56fn1">Frederick W. Latrash, Vice Consul in New
                                Delhi.</note> who has left this morning for Calcutta. In Calcutta he
                            will discreetly endeavor to get in touch with one of the two members of
                            the Tibetan Trade Mission and inquire if one of them is in a position to
                            take the message and to hand it personally to the Dalai Lama in Yatung.
                            If one of the members of the Trade Mission cannot undertake to give the
                            message to the Dalai Lama personally, Latrash is not to entrust the
                            errand to the Trade Mission.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">According to a
                                letter to Henderson from Fraser Wilkins, First Secretary of Embassy
                                in New Delhi, May 23, 1951, not printed, Henderson’s message was not
                                sent through the Tibetan Trade Mission. On May 13, during a visit to
                                Kalimpong, India, for discussions with Tibetan officials, Wilkins
                                gave a copy to Dzasa Liushar, the Tibetan Foreign Secretary (New
                                Delhi Post Files: Lot 58 F 95).</note> (2) . . . .</p>
                        <p>The paper on which the messages are written has been purchased in India
                            and will bear no indication of origin. Both Mr. Latrash and <pb n="1612"
                                xml:id="pg_1612" facs="0154"/>Mr. Harrer are to insist that there
                            shall in no event be anything in writing which will indicate that the
                            messages come from me. The Dalai Lama is, however, to be told orally
                            that I am sending a message to him. I shall have to trust the ingenuity
                            of Latrash to arrange for this oral message to be delivered.</p>
                        <p>I realize that a considerable amount of risk is involved in sending a
                            message of this kind. My judgment is that it is better for this risk to
                            be taken than to see the Chinese Communists succeed by trickery in
                            taking over Tibet and in gaining control of the Dalai Lama and his
                            treasures. I have not informed the Department of this matter by telegram
                            or asked for its authority, because of my fear of a leak. Furthermore,
                            if my message should become public, the Department is free, if it
                            desires, to disclaim any responsibility in the matter.</p>
                        <p>My taking of this action does not mean that I have any intention of
                            following the practice in the future of going ahead in matters of this
                            kind without proper authority. I realize the danger of officers in the
                            field committing acts on their own which might not be in line with the
                            policies of the Department. It seems to me, however, that this was one
                            of the rare occasions when I should move forward fast, taking upon
                            myself the entire responsibility for the consequences.</p>
                        <p>Please inform George McGhee and Dean Rusk of my action. I leave to your
                            and their discretion the decision as to who else should be brought into
                            the secret. The appropriate members of the unnameable agency should, of
                            course, be informed.</p>

                                sympathy for Tibet and deep concern for the welfare of His Holiness
                                and His people sends the following earnest suggestions to His

                                        <item>“1. The Peiping Communist regime is determined to
                                            obtain complete control over Tibet. No concession made
                                            to that regime by His Holiness can change this
                                            determination. The Chinese Communists prefer to gain
                                            control through trickery rather than through force. They
                                            are therefore anxious to persuade His Holiness to make
                                            an agreement which would allow them to establish a
                                            representative in Lhasa.</item>
                                        <item>“2. The establishment of a representative of the
                                            Peiping Communist regime in Lhasa would serve only to
                                            speed up the seizing of all of Tibet by the Chinese

                                            … Any treasuries which might be returned to Lhasa would
                                            eventually be taken over by the Chinese

                                        <item>“4. His Holiness should not return to Lhasa while the
                                            danger exists that by force or trickery the Chinese
                                            Communists might seize Lhasa. He should leave Yatung for
                                            some foreign country if it should look like the Chinese
                                            Communists might try to prevent his escape.</item>
                                        <item>“5. It is suggested that His Holiness send
                                            representatives at once to Ceylon. These representatives
                                            should try to arrange with the Government of Ceylon for
                                            the immediate transfer to Ceylon of the treasures of His
                                            Holiness. They should also try to obtain permission for
                                            His Holiness and His Household to find asylum in Ceylon
                                            if His Holiness should leave Tibet. After the Government
                                            of Ceylon has granted permission for asylum, His
                                            Holiness should ask the Government of India for
                                            assurance that if he and His Household should leave
                                            Tibet they could pass through India to Ceylon.</item>

                                            immediately to send a mission to the United States where
                                            it would be prepared to make a direct appeal to the

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Livy</hi>: According to the reports from the
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> Mission on Formosa, indications
                            are that the Chinese Military authorities feel that the United States
                            will underwrite local currency expenses required to implement the
                            military assistance program. As you can well appreciate, such an
                            attitude on the part of the Chinese Military authorities can prove to be
                            extremely dangerous. Pending the establishment of a policy for handling
                            “impact costs” in which State, <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, and
                            the Defense Department are in accord, it seems highly desirable to us
                            that the Chinese Government be officially notified that the United
                            States will not tolerate unwarranted military expenses nor diversion of
                            Formosa’s resources to the point of endangering the economic stability
                            thus far achieved.</p>

                            the Embassy which provides for a course of action, in coordination with
                            the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> Chief of Mission, to make known
                            to the Chinese authorities our position in respect to unwarranted
                            over-expansion of the military budget. Subject to changes and
                            corrections in the attached draft as you consider appropriate, we
                            suggest early dispatch to the Embassy in Taipeh.<note n="2"

                        <p>The Department of State is not prepared, without further consideration,
                            to agree with the Department of Defense recommendation that “<gloss

                            of a military nature as he considers necessary and urgent, but that he
                            be charged with <pb n="1615" xml:id="pg_1615" facs="0157"/>immediately
                            and simultaneously informing the Department of Defense, the Ambassador

                            actions”. It is also noted that your memorandum states that the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff “have concluded that the current mission of the
                            Commander-in-Chief, Far East (<gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                            >CINCFE</gloss>), with respect to Formosa and the military importance of
                            the island dictate that all U.S. military activities on Formosa be the
                            responsibility of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>”. The
                            Department of State believes that a set of military and economic
                            objectives consistent with our foreign policy should be pursued with
                            respect to Formosa, requiring coordinated action in policy formulation
                            and in administration. I do not need to mention the difficult political
                            problems which relate to Formosa. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> program for Formosa is being formulated to provide
                            economic assistance to the basic economy of the island including the
                            furnishing of common use items for existing Chinese Nationalist forces
                            and the support of the Formosan budget and the military component
                            thereof. Clearly the military and the economic assistance programs for
                            Formosa should be closely coordinated. The same considerations will
                            apply in connection with the Fiscal Year 1952 program. I should,
                            therefore, want to discuss informally with you the reasons why the
                            Department of Defense considers the military factors to be of such
                            importance as to require that all U.S. military activities on Formosa be
                            treated as occurring in an operational theater.</p>
                        <p>The discussion which I suggested in the foregoing paragraph will also be
                            helpful to me in preparing a reply to certain policy questions raised by
                            the Director of the Bureau of the Budget,<note n="4" xml:id="d58fn4">See

                            force is going through the Formosa Straits and down to Hainan. Does the

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral Sherman</hi>: We have given them a job to
                            do—to get some photographs for reconnaissance purposes. The best way to
                            get these is to use aircraft from naval vessels. It is not so much a
                            show of force as a demonstration that we are still on the job that was
                            assigned to us last June. Last summer the ships were there often. During
                            the winter <pb n="1617" xml:id="pg_1617" facs="0159"/>they have been
                            away. Now spring is coming and it is essential to go back on a tour

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Nitze</hi>: The way this thing is handled will
                            have an important effect in our discussions with the British. If it

                            we go down there. We would not go while the Korean situation is bad.</p>

                            if any, air reconnaissance so far. What we want to do is send in fast
                            photographic planes combined with naval operations. We haven’t had

                            to Formosa would require us to get a change in the Presidential

                                believe that such a depolyment would adversely affect their
                                commitments or operations in Korea and elsewhere.</item>

                            <item>In the absence of US participation in the defense of Taiwan, the
                                Chinese Communists could, after the necessary redeployment, probably
                                capture Taiwan by a large-scale invasion. We believe, however, that,
                                if the US Fleet participates in the defense of the island, the
                                Chinese Communists do not have the capability of launching a
                                successful large-scale invasion on Taiwan without substantial Soviet
                                assistance. The USSR would probably estimate that it would incur a
                                substantial risk of war with the US if it furnished assistance of
                                the type and scale that would be required to make the operation
                                successful. We do not believe the USSR is likely to incur this
                                degree of risk solely on account of the advantage to be gained from
                                Chinese Communist conquest of Taiwan in 1951.</item>

                                assault on Taiwan. Such an assault might be launched in the
                                expectation of making a landing before the US Fleet could intervene
                                effectively and of exploiting whatever potential dissidence exists

                                is not likely to attempt either a large-scale or limited attack on
                                Taiwan during 1951 so long as US policy with regard to Taiwan
                                remains unchanged and the Chinese Communists continue to be
                                committed in the Korean war. The likelihood of a Communist invasion

                        <p>Mr. Greenhill called and gave me the essence of an exchange of
                            communications between the Foreign Office and the Chargé d’Affaires at
                                Peking.<note n="1" xml:id="d65fn1">Lionel Henry Lamb.</note> The
                            Foreign Office had indicated to the Chargé the possible desirability of
                            now making representations regarding the welfare of various foreign
                            nationals in China. The U.S. was concerned with the welfare of its
                            citizens, and the UK, Canada and Australia were likewise concerned. It
                            is proposed that there be made a general approach on behalf of the
                            nationals of those four countries in view of the “increasing gravity” of
                            the problem.</p>
                        <p>The British Chargé replied in favor of taking the matter up at this time,
                            suggesting that representations be limited in the first instance to the
                            arrests of nationals of the several countries, that questions of travel
                            permits and visas might be taken up separately at another time. He
                            remarked on the Chinese Communist side the “special motives of
                            retaliation against United States interests” possibly deriving from U.S.
                            policy. He proposed to take the whole matter up in an <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> along the general lines of the attached
                                draft.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Not printed.</note> The Chargé
                            agreed that the potential effect of such an <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> would probably not be helped by appeals to legal
                            considerations and he therefore prepared to limit his argumentation in
                            this regard. He believed that no harm could be wrought for persons at
                            present under detention if the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> were
                            accurate and its terminology not violent. He believed that it would be
                            appropriate to wait two or three weeks after presentation of the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> to see whether there would be any
                            developments, whereupon a statement might be issued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Greenhill said, apparently reflecting his own thinking, that he saw
                            no reason why one could not at time of presentation of the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> make a brief statement to the
                            general effect that representation to the Chinese Communist authorities
                            had been made regarding the matter in point. I said that I myself tended
                            to feel as I inferred Mr. Lamb (the British Chargé at Peking) also felt,
                            that it would probably be better to make no statement at this time but
                            to wait two or three weeks and then make the matter public.</p>
                        <pb n="1626" xml:id="pg_1626" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>I commented briefly on the draft presented by Mr. Greenhill, suggesting
                            in regard to paragraph (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) a rewording to propose
                            likewise that persons under detention have access to such legal counsel
                            as they were entitled by Chinese law and to propose that hearings of
                            their cases be held promptly and that the British Charge be informed of
                            the particular legal charges made against those under detention.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Greenhill, in a subsequent telephone conversation, confirmed that the
                            British authorities proposed to go forward with the matter.</p>

                        <p>1381. Fol text handed Chi Govt today:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>The exec branch of the US Govt has under consideration requesting
                                additional funds from the Amer Congress, during its present session,
                                for econ and mil aid to the gen area of China, Such funds, if
                                requested and approved by Congress, wld be appropriated for the
                                entire area and not firmly allocated or committed to any particular
                                country.</p>
                            <p>It has been brought out in detailed discussions between officials of
                                the Chi Govt and of the US that the absorption of mil aid cld have
                                an inflationary impact on the economy of Taiwan unless all possible
                                precautionary methods are taken. The US Govt has noted with
                                gratification the improvement in the econ position of Taiwan during
                                1950, such improvement having resulted partly from the efforts of
                                the Chi Govt and partly from <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                                assistance in a naturally rich environment. However, it is
                                considered that if these gains are to be retained and further
                                advances achieved, it will be necessary for the Chi Govt to exert
                                still further efforts to expand exports, to control imports, to
                                increase tax revenues by raising rates wherever possible and by
                                improving tax collection methods, and to reduce non-essential govt
                                expenditures.</p>
                            <p>The US Govt proceeds on the assumption that it will be possible, in
                                    <pb n="1628" xml:id="pg_1628" facs="0170"/>the visible future,
                                for the US to reduce and eventually discontinue econ subsidies to
                                Taiwan. Undoubtedly the Chi Govt will appreciate the impossibility
                                of the underwriting of Taiwan’s economy by the Amer Govt for an
                                indefinitely extended period of time. Especially while the US itself
                                is engaged in a large expansion of its own mil establishment, at
                                heavy cost to its own people, the US Govt is not in a position to
                                guarantee to offset the effects on Taiwan living standards of the
                                supply of Amer mil material for defense against aggression. The US
                                Govt considers that Taiwan has substantial assets already available
                                to it and would be deeply concerned over any evidence that the Chi
                                Govt is not exploiting those assets consistently, to the best of its
                                ability, in achieving econ stability and security for Taiwan.</p>
                            <p>The standard by which the US Govt determines econ and/or mil aid to
                                any country is the capacity of each recipient to make effective use
                                of such aid, with a maximum of self-help, in producing durable
                                results. Moreover, the US Govt holds that continued assistance to
                                any country can be justified only as long as it undertakes econ and
                                other sacrifices proportionate to the Amer aid extended.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Han Li-wu called by appointment today on Mr. Rusk and, in response to
                            the latter’s questions, said: the attitude of the Formosan populace
                            toward the national governmental establishment, particularly the
                            military, had ameliorated considerably. For example, the military forces
                            expect to evacuate this spring the last of the school buildings they
                            have occupied. Local elections should be completed this year and they
                            have been well conducted, with the exception of Taipei city where
                            election conditions had been bad. The food situation on Formosa was
                            good. Formosan rice production was expected to go up to nearly 1,500,000
                            tons this year, which would represent the best crop since 1939. Dr. Han
                            said that, although there were continuing complaints from the natives,
                            he himself had investigated and found that the general wellbeing of the
                            local population was as good as it had been in 1944–45.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk asked about the situation of the “third force” and the <pb

                            National Government: how could the many political fragments be formed
                            into an entity? Dr. Han said that this was indeed a difficult question
                            but indicated his belief that Chiang Kai-shek was the only person who
                            was solid enough to form a nucleus for the anti-Communist force. He
                            mentioned the possibility of younger men coming into the force, but it
                            was not clear from his remarks how the amalgam could be constituted. He
                            said that mass executions on the mainland had been planned as long ago
                            as last June but were not carried out because of Communist uncertainty
                            about their effect at that time. The Korean war had made this policy
                            opportune; Dr. Han said that the executions would undoubtedly hamper
                            guerrilla operations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Han spoke of the widespread Russian influence on the Communist
                            regime, which was exercised through the international element in the
                            Party and through the use of commissars.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk asked Dr. Han if he had any questions himself to put. Dr. Han
                            said that he wished to mention: <list>

                                <item>British attitudes. He said that his visit to England had led
                                    him to believe that the British attitude in regard to Communist
                                    China might be subject to change. He said that the Lord

                                    Communists continued, the British Government might have to
                                    recast its policy toward the Peiping regime.</item>

                                <item>Dr. Han said he wished to speak of the need for aid to Formosa

                        <p>Dr. Han did not elaborate on these points as Mr. Rusk had a meeting with
                            the Ambassadors. Mr. Rusk said that he wished, however, to see Dr. Han
                            again before his departure from the U.S.</p>

                        <p>Mr. McCormack stated that he had just had a talk with Joe Martin<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">Representative Joseph W. Martin of
                                Massachusetts, House Minority Leader.</note> and he was convinced
                            that the Republicans were banking on a deal between the U.N. and China
                            which would permit China to cease firing in return for, in addition to
                            retention of North Korea, (1) recognition by the U.S. of Red China, (2)
                            a seat in the U.N. for Red China, and (3) the return of Formosa to China
                            (Red China). I told Mr. McCormack that I had no specific information at
                            all on this subject, and that I would have to speak entirely in a
                            personal capacity. I stated that it was my opinion that such a move was
                            completely out of the question.</p>
                        <p>I then asked Mr. McCormack if I could ask him some questions strictly in
                            a personal capacity. He replied that he would be delighted to try to
                            answer any questions I might ask. I asked him how he would feel if the
                            U.N. was able to negotiate a cease-fire on the condition that the U.S.
                            would recognize the Red regime. His response was that it would be a
                            calamity. He stated further that he would rather see us pull out of
                            Korea than to be guilty of such an act of “appeasement.” He stated that
                            if the U.S. were to recognize the Red regime it would be a matter of a
                            short time before the U.N. voted a seat for this regime, and it would
                            really be only a short time subsequent to that before Formosa would be
                            returned to China. He said that such a move would completely destroy all
                            of the Democratic support for the Administration. He stated that he felt
                            that the Democratic support was now more solidly behind the
                            Administration in its policy for the Far East than it had ever been
                            before. Such an act of “appeasement” would be so <pb n="1631"
                                xml:id="pg_1631" facs="0173"/>repugnant to him personally that he
                            would feel tempted to resign from public office.</p>
                        <p>I then asked Mr. McCormack to place himself in the shoes of the Red
                            Chinese authorities for a moment. I then asked what would be his view to
                            negotiating a cease-fire in the absence of a total victory over his
                            forces. Would he negotiate without some concession on the part of his
                            adversaries, and if not, what concessions would he feel that the U.N.
                            could make which would make it attractive for the Reds to cease fire in
                            the absence of a total military victory. His response got back to the
                            original premise that any recognition of the Red regime would be
                            “appeasement”, and these other dire consequences would flow from this
                            act.</p>
                        <p>I know Mr. McCormack well enough to know that he thoroughly understood
                            that I was speaking to him in a personal capacity. I am reporting this
                            only to reflect the depth of feeling that he has on this issue.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Lawton</hi>: I present herewith answers
                            to the various questions contained in your letter of March 23, 1951. The
                            replies bear the same numbering as the questions contained in your
                            letter, and they have been prepared in collaboration with the Department
                            of Defense and the Economic Cooperation Administration in so far as the
                            questions touched on subjects affecting their interest.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> “What are immediate U.S. objectives
                            with respect to Formosa?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The immediate and overriding United
                            States objective with respect to Formosa is to deny its control to
                            hostile hands. Prior to June 27, 1950, this objective was sought by
                            political and economic means. On June 27 the President ordered the U.S.
                            7th Fleet to prevent any attack on Formosa and called upon the Chinese
                            National Government to cease all air and sea operations against the
                            mainland. Directly from this decision flows the necessity of bringing
                            the defensive capability of the forces on Formosa to a state such that
                            they could, in conjunction with the 7th Fleet, repel any assault from
                            the mainland. This decision further imposes a necessity of continuing
                            and expanding the U.S. program of economic assistance not only to assist
                            in maintaining political stability but also to help Formosa develop an
                            economy capable of supporting these modernized forces <pb n="1632"
                                xml:id="pg_1632" facs="0174"/>through rehabilitation and modest
                            expansion of key industrial, transport, communications, and power
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> “In light of recent and prospective
                            political and military developments, can we continue to assume that
                            accomplishment of these objectives is consistent with efforts to achieve
                            a settlement in Korea?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The Department of State believes that it
                            can and should be assumed that the accomplishment of our objectives with
                            respect to Formosa are consistent with efforts to achieve a settlement
                            in Korea. Our action in Korea has been in response to our obligations
                            under the United Nations Charter to resist and discourage aggression.
                            The United States Government has, however, no intention of modifying its
                            objectives with regard to Formosa in return for a settlement in Korea.
                            If Formosa fell, a military settlement in Korea could be impeded because
                            the hazard to our operations would be increased by the presence of
                            unfriendly forces in this advanced position.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> “To what extent would a settlement in
                            Korea be likely to affect the amount, form, and timing of U.S. aid to
                            the Chinese Nationalist Government?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> It is difficult to forecast what effect a
                            settlement in Korea would have on the amount, form, and timing of United
                            States aid to the Chinese National Government. At one extreme, a
                            settlement in Korea accompanied by what the President described as “the
                            restoration of security in the Pacific”, might well reduce the need for
                            United States economic and military assistance to Formosa. At the other
                            extreme, a settlement in Korea imposed upon the United Nations by
                            superior force, might indeed require an increase in United States
                            assistance to Formosa. I believe the safest assumption is that the
                            United States Government should proceed with its present programs and
                            plans for assistance to Formosa without regard to the hypothetical
                            effect that an unpredictable settlement in Korea would produce.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> “In what respect is the future of
                            Formosa involved in the proposed pending treaty of peace with
                            Japan?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The present tentative draft peace treaty

                            prepared by this Government does not seek to determine the disposition
                            of Formosa and merely formalizes Japanese relinquishment of sovereignty
                            over Formosa and the Pescadores. There is no policy or requirement which
                            necessitates the resolution of the problem through the medium of a peace
                            treaty with Japan. You will recall that the President stated on June 27,
                            1950 that “The determination of the future status of Formosa must await
                            the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with
                            Japan, or consideration by the United Nations”.</p>

                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Question:</hi> “What is the long-term U.S. objective
                            in Formosa?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> The long-term United States objective
                            with respect to Formosa can be stated as the achievement of a solution
                            of the problem by international agreement and not by force, and the
                            avoidance of Formosa’s falling into hands which would exploit its
                            strategic location and facilities to the detriment of our national
                            security interests. The President has stated that we have no territorial
                            ambitions for ourselves with respect to Formosa and that the present
                            policy of “neutralization” is without prejudice to political questions
                            affecting the Island.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">President Truman made
                                these statements in a special message to Congress on July 19, 1950,

                            United States with respect to Formosa is to contribute to a situation of

                            the United States, as well as military objectives, are taken into

                            be considered that the strategic or military interest in denying Formosa
                            to hostile hands constitutes the overriding element in present

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> It has been determined by the Military
                            Survey Mission that in order to successfully defend Formosa, assuming
                            support by the <pb n="1634" xml:id="pg_1634" facs="0176"/>7th Fleet,
                            there should be a ground force the equivalent of 31 divisions, plus
                            headquarters organizations for 10 Army headquarters, 5 area defense
                            headquarters, headquarters Taiwan Defense Command, and the Ministry of
                            National Defense; an Air Force of 4 fighter groups and one light
                            bombardment squadron; and a Navy of approximately 60 vessels. Without
                            support of the 7th Fleet, the Ground and Air Force requirements remain
                            the same but the Navy requirement would be considerably greater, and the
                            Chinese Navy is unable to absorb the total number of ships required. It
                            is believed that the Chinese Navy at the present time can absorb about
                            12 additional ships and about 12 in the following year. About 4
                            Destroyer Escorts and 20 Sub-Chasers, or Motor Gunboats, is considered
                            to be a realistic number. Even with these additional vessels it is not
                            considered that their fleet would be capable of repelling a large
                            invasion armada. None of these vessels have been programmed because of
                            limitations of funds, assumption of continued 7th Fleet support, and the
                            feeling that before such a program is undertaken, United States
                            technicians and advisors should be sent to Formosa to develop training
                            methods, operational procedures and shipboard maintenance.</p>

                            used in United States military schools. Training observed was conducted
                            and accepted with enthusiasm. It is believed that the training methods
                            are generally sound, although qualified instructors are largely
                            unavailable except in the schools. Training has been hampered by lack of

                            field <pb n="1635" xml:id="pg_1635" facs="0177"/>and combined training
                            has likewise been inadequate. These deficiencies have been recognized by
                            the Commanding General, Ground Forces, and with proper military aid the
                            deficiencies should eventually be corrected.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Morale Deficiency—Ground Forces</hi>.—Morale of the
                            troops during the visit of the Survey Team was good. It is considered
                            that morale is high at the present time and is bolstered up by receipt

                            <hi rend="italic">Training Deficiency—Air Force</hi>.—The state of
                            training of air crews is poor by comparison with USAF units of similar
                            type. There are two primary reasons for this condition: First, air crews
                            have had very little air-to-air combat experience since few of them have
                            ever fought against a first-rate air power; second, the Chinese
                            Nationalist Air Force has always been handicapped by a shortage of
                            aircraft and supplies with the result that it has been unable to carry
                            on a continual air crew training program. At the present time air crews
                            receive virtually no training over and above that gained in performance
                            of essential defense patrols and reconnaissance missions. Maintenance
                            personnel are considered about 60% qualified as compared to USAF
                            standards. Of the total maintenance personnel assigned to the Chinese
                            Nationalist Air Force, approximately 524 officers and 247 enlisted men
                            have been trained in the United States, while 2,296 officers and 10,531
                            enlisted men have received some training in the Chinese Air Force
                            Technical Schools. Many of the above enlisted personnel are qualified to
                            perform only the most elementary maintenance duties. The picture is
                            somewhat brighter in the more technical maintenance fields such as
                            machinists, metalsmiths, dope and fabric, and wood workers, due to the
                            fact that there is a considerable pool of these technicians available to
                            the 4th and 5th echelon maintenance depots.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Training Deficiency—Navy</hi>.—In personnel, the
                            officer corps of the Chinese Navy is lacking in sea experience and the
                            senior officers generally do not have the professional qualifications or
                            background for top-level planning and administrative duties. Enlisted
                            personnel suffer from inadequate training. Levels of training are
                            unsatisfactory and training methods are either non-existent or are
                            worked out on paper but not carried out in practice.</p>

                            needs. The morale among enlisted personnel is good, although low by U.S.

                            the Nationalist forces will be required to make military assistance
                            effective?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Answer:</hi> It is considered that U.S. supervision
                            will have to be exercised to a considerable degree to make military
                            assistance effective. To this end a Military Assistance Advisory Group
                            is being established in the near future and an initial increment of
                            approximately 46 officers and 68 enlisted men will be ordered to
                            Formosa. It is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate size of
                            the Military Assistance Advisory Group. It can only be determined after
                            the interim organization has been operating for a period of time and
                            submits recommendations for increased complement; however, it is
                            presently estimated that the initial increment will be increased by the
                            addition of between 400 and 500 personnel.</p>

                            impact. Between one-fourth and one-third of this amount is for

                            this level, economic assistance can be tapered off, as rehabilitation
                            and expansion of industrial, power and transportation facilities begin
                            to pay off in terms of increased local production and exports and

                            officers of the Commie armed forces. Observers frequently state that

                        <p>On April 19, General MacArthur, who had recently returned to the United
                            States, presented his views on the Korean war and United States Far
                            Eastern policy, particularly with regard to China and Formosa, before a
                            joint session of Congress. He declared that the fall of Formosa would
                            endanger the entire United States line of defense in the Pacific and
                            urged that “under no circumstances” should it be permitted to fall under
                            Communist control. While indicating that it would be irrational to
                            consider sending ground forces into continental China, he advocated a
                            drastic revision of United States strategy in order to defeat “this new
                            enemy” on the China mainland. In particular, he called for removal of
                            restrictions on bombing north of the Yalu, intensification of the
                            economic blockade of China, imposition of a naval blockade along the
                            China coast, removal of restrictions on the Chinese Nationalist forces
                            together with United States logistical support for their use against the
                            mainland. For the text of the address, see the <hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Dr. Han returned to see me by appointment today. He hopes to return to
                            Washington in a week or ten days in order to see Mr. Rusk, <pb n="1642"
                                xml:id="pg_1642" facs="0184"/>who he told me had said to him at
                            their last brief meeting that he wished to discuss the “third force”.
                            Dr. Han then launched into a discussion of the “third force”, arguing
                            that the individuals considered to comprise it lacked arms, money and
                            political power. Dr. Han went on to say that the Generalissimo must be
                            the rallying point for resistance to Communism in China.</p>
                        <p>Making the point that I was speaking frankly and informally, I told Dr.
                            Han I agreed a resistance force to be effective must have, among other
                            things, material power and if possible the mantle of legality.
                            Nevertheless I said I had seen with my own eyes in China the extent to
                            which patriotic anti-Communist Chinese had been alienated from the
                            Generalissimo by the actions of his government I said that what seemed
                            to me to be required was a widening of the base of the appeal of the
                            National Government and the development of a liberal program which would
                            attract to it increased support. I said that it fell upon him and other
                            younger leaders like himself to insure that the Generalissimo and the
                            little group around him realized that as now constituted they could not
                            be a standard to which all anti-Communists would flock.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that I also thought it was important that there should
                            be no misapprehension as to the meaning of General MacArthur’s relief or
                            the political debate in which this country was now engaged. I said that
                            the President had stated that no change in this Government’s policy was
                            involved or contemplated and that this certainly comprehended our policy
                            with respect to Formosa.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that I thought it was also important that there should
                            be no delusion on Formosa as to either our ability or willingness to
                            underwrite their deficits. I said that if Congress approved the
                            projected plans there would be next year a program of military
                            assistance to Formosa to increase their capacity for self defense. I
                            said, however, that this program would bring in its wake economic
                            burdens and that while we would continue economic assistance through
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, the problem of adjustments of a
                            more stringent administration of their tax laws, of an improvement in
                            their exports, and other measures involving an austerity scale of
                            expenditures would have to be undertaken by the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I referred to newspaper reports in this country that records of
                            their secret police allegedly reporting all movements and actions of
                            U.S. Government officials in China in recent years had apparently been
                            turned over or made available to individuals or groups in this country.
                            I said that deep and friendly as my own feelings toward China were, I
                            thought he would understand me when I said that such actions to me were
                            revolting and not designed to improve our relations. <pb n="1643"

                            amazement, and indignation at the latter point.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving he recapitulated the other points which I had made and
                            reassured me that he regarded this as a “private” conversation.</p>

                            United States policy with regard to China was a major subject of

                                    and May 23, written by Marshall during a trip to Manila and Hong
                                    Kong; the memoranda are filed in the folder labeled “China 1951

                                    noted in his memoirs that Marshall went to Hong Kong and made
                                    himself available for contacts with the Chinese after the
                                    Department received “a suggestion with some credentials of
                                    reliability” that it might be possible to initiate negotiations
                                    for an armistice in Korea through an approach to Peking; see

                                <p>Mr. Marshall stated in an interview on May 13, 1974, that before
                                    he left for Hong Kong he had a brief meeting with Secretary
                                    Acheson and a meeting of 40 to 45 minutes with Deputy Under
                                    Secretary Matthews. He was instructed to try to make contact
                                    with the Chinese and, in case of a response, to communicate with
                                    the Department. The interview with Marshall is recorded in a

                            probably get the word through, since rumors and news eddy around Hong
                            Kong and surge in and out of China. He said that if anyone in Peiping
                            should be receptive to the idea of talking an approach would surely be
                            forthcoming; and that if Peiping were not, we would find it out by being
                            ignored. [Name deleted] counseled that it would take a period of several
                            days to develop the prospects and that we must be prepared to tarry in
                            patience a while.</p>

                        <p>Present at the outset were: Consul General McConaughy, Sabin Chase, and
                            C. B. Marshall, hereafter referred to in the first person. After I had
                            stated briefly what we were about, and at McConaughy’s instance and with
                            our concurrence, the following were brought in on the meeting: The
                            political officer, Ralph Clough; … [name deleted], and the executive
                            officer, Joseph Yager.</p>
                        <p>McConaughy expressed doubts over the positive results in prospect. …</p>
                        <p>The conversation shifted to procedure. The following points were agreed
                            on: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that Chase and I should talk to a lot of
                            individuals of varied status and let the word get around that we were at
                            hand and had something up our sleeves; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that I
                            should participate in the various conversations so as to preserve the
                            appearance that both Chase and I were there on an information-gathering
                            mission; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) that we should not make overtures
                            about possible channels to Peiping but should appear interested and
                            alert to any hints coming from others; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that
                            the attempt to lay a channel to Peiping should proceed along as many
                            lines as appeared practicable; (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) that I would
                            generally be introduced as a member of the office of the Secretary of
                            State so as to highlight the idea of being someone in the line of
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The name of Eric Chow was brought forward as a possible contact. It was
                            explained that he was editor of <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>,
                            local outlet of the Chinese News Agency. It was recognized as a
                            Communist sheet, <pb n="1654" xml:id="pg_1654" facs="0196"/>and he was
                            reputed to be a local agent for the Peiping Reds in regard to matters
                            besides news. It was agreed that Clough would arrange a meeting with
                            Chow for us at a dinner party at Clough’s home.</p>
                        <p>A second specific name brought forward was that of Chang Shih-chao.<note
                                n="1" xml:id="d82fn2">Chang Shih-chao, a journalist, educator, and
                                lawyer, had first become prominent as a radical political writer in
                                the early twentieth century; he was a member of the Political and
                                Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council in the
                                People’s Republic of China.</note> It was explained that he was a
                            person close to Mao Tse-tung and that [name deleted] … had access to
                            someone who was in contact with Chang Shih-chao and that [name deleted]
                            could probably arrange to have word of our presence in Hong Kong
                            forwarded through that channel.</p>
                        <p>In a metaphor used by one of the consular officers present, we should
                            fire some shotguns and a rifle. Eric Chow would be in the birdshot
                            category and the channel to Chang Shih-chao would be in the bullet
                            category. In the first instance there was a high probability and in the
                            second a virtual certainty of getting the word through to Peiping.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed also that Yager should seek possible contacts for us on a
                            trip to Macao later in the week. (Yager went to Macao about two days
                            later and was gone for some five days. On his return he reported
                            negative results).</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that to facilitate our conversations we should move from
                            our temporary quarters in the Peninsula Hotel, Kowloon, to the Hong Kong
                            Hotel. It was pointed out that security would not be good at the Hong
                            Kong Hotel (nor for that matter, anywhere else) but that this would be
                            to our advantage since it would be well to have a presence and
                            activities made known though not published. The local officers agreed
                            that all the waiters and room boys would probably be watching and
                            reporting on our activities. It was agreed that to forestall interloping
                            a check should be made of our room in the Hong Kong Hotel to determine
                            whether any devices to pick up our conversations had been installed in
                            the room. (This check was made four days later. The inspecting officer
                            reported negative results. He said never yet had such devices been
                            turned up in the Far East although they were commonly used in Europe and
                            South America).</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that our visit should be deemphasized so far as the British
                            were concerned. It would be advisable for us to make some official call
                            but this would be confined to a visit to the political adviser to the
                            Governor and Chase and I should be accompanied by one of the subordinate
                            members of the Consulate staff rather than by the Consul General
                            himself. (The Consul General and I subsequently agreed that this was not
                            a wise decision and that it would be well to pay a visit to the Governor
                            of the colony).</p>

                                    hours. It was held at a dinner party at Ralph Clough’s house
                                    from about 8:00 to 11:00 p. m. No notes were taken. This
                                    summary, written out on May 11, is derived from catchwords set
                                    down, with Chase’s aid, within an hour after the last utterance.
                                    As it emerges in this writing, the conversation sounds more

                        <p>Present were Eric Chow, Ralph Clough, Sabin Chase, and C. B. Marshall,
                            hereafter referred to in the first person.</p>
                        <p>Chow turned out to be a fat, extroverted Chinese, about 36 years old. It
                            would be almost, but not quite, fitting to call him urbane. The show of
                            warmth was too much, the laugh at sallies of humor too hearty, and too
                            obvious the attempt to disassociate himself spiritually from the Peiping
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>Chow began by covering the development of the Chinese Communists’
                            tutelage to Moscow. He recounted the Sian-fu kidnapping and the sequel
                            of cooperation between the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> and the
                            Communists. He recounted the break-up of cooperation in 1940 signaled by
                            the attack on the Fourth Field Army. He said that so long as positional
                            warfare had continued, cooperation had remained possible but as soon as
                            the two political elements had been placed in competition with each
                            other in developing a popular base in a static situation cooperation had
                            ceased to be possible. He recalled that at the time preceding the
                            break-up of cooperation he had been at Yenan. He said the Communist
                            leaders then had seemed oblivious of Russia as a special consideration
                            in Chinese policy. He said that nothing in their speeches or
                            conversation or in the indoctrination of their cadres had indicated
                            special regard for Moscow; no Russian infiltration was evident. He noted
                            that at that time Chou En-lai had been the exponent of the united
                            front.</p>
                        <p>Chow said that after V-J Day, in September of 1945, Mao Tse-tung had made
                            a speech asserting the purely Chinese basis of Communist policy and that
                            this speech contained a veiled warning to Russia not to regard China in
                            a special position of subordination.</p>
                        <p>Chow said that the orientation toward Moscow had resulted largely in
                            reaction to United States backing of the Kuomintang. He said that the
                            Chinese Communists had felt that alone they could not prevail against
                            domestic enemies supported by the United States and came to regard the
                            United States as the implacable foe of any Chinese development of
                            communism.</p>
                        <pb n="1656" xml:id="pg_1656" facs="0198"/>
                        <p>This interpretation, he added, had been strengthened decisively by the
                            publication of the China White Paper in 1949. Chow described this as
                            solidifying the decision to tie to Moscow’s apron strings. He said that
                            many copies of it had been obtained at Communist headquarters and had
                            been analyzed page by page and sentence by sentence; it was taken as
                            confirmation that the United States was disposed to intervene in Chinese
                            affairs, to throw its weight behind the side it deemed conservative, and
                            to regard with active disfavor any Chinese course in the opposite
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>A comment was interpolated to the effect that the publication was
                            regarded by others as a blow to the Chiang regime. Chow observed that
                            the China White Paper had established a high mark for abortiveness as a
                            diplomatic gambit. This appraisal I did not contest.</p>
                        <p>Chow said the policy of “leaning to one side” had been brought forth
                            tentatively soon after the issuance of the White Paper, and in sequence
                            then occurred the establishment of the Communist government at Peiping,
                            the recognition by Russia, and strong re-affirmation of the pro-Russian
                            orientation. He said that at that time the Politburo at Peiping was
                            divided on the policy of leaning to one side.</p>
                        <p>I asked whether these high authorities were still divided on this. He
                            said that they probably were, but this was supported by no overt
                            evidence, for whatever differences might occur within the Politburo they
                            were not outwardly reflected. He pointed out that the semiofficial
                            Foreign Relations Association at Peiping had recently issued some
                            statement alluding to the desire of the Chinese people for friendship
                            with all other peoples. He said that this indicated that the policy of
                            leaning to one side was not to be regarded as a universally accepted and
                            permanent formula.</p>
                        <p>Chase observed that the word “people” has special meaning in the
                            Communist lexicon—the populace regarded from the viewpoint in
                            proletarian politics. He observed that friendship for all peoples meant
                            not friendship for all governments or all nations but friendship for all
                            politically organized proletariats. I added that the word “people” had
                            special meaning in all totalitarian lexicons. I compared its meaning in
                            the Communist lexicon with its meaning in the Nazi, Fascist, and
                            Falangist vocabulary.</p>
                        <p>Chow said that anyway the policy of leaning to one side was not really a
                            policy but should rather be described as a strategy. He said it lacked
                            the permanence of a policy but did not bear on the ends of the regime
                            but related rather only to temporary means and would pass in time. He
                            said that some Stalinist zealots had espoused the idea of doing away
                            with instruction in English and Western European languages in the
                            Chinese educational system since important Chinese relations <pb
                                n="1657" xml:id="pg_1657" facs="0199"/>in the future would be only
                            with Russia but that this suggestion had been overruled on the ground
                            that China would again some day deal with the rest of the world.</p>
                        <p>Chow said that the true place of the policy—or strategy—of leaning to one
                            side might soon be made clear in a book being written by Mao. He said
                            that Mao had retired from the scene of active politics some months ago
                            in order to write a book bringing up to date the theoretical basis of
                            the party. He said Mao believed he had become too deeply enmeshed in
                            practical politics and had need of refreshing his theoretic sources.
                            Meanwhile, he said, the leadership had devolved on Chou En-lai for
                            running the government and on Liu Shao-chi for party affairs. He said
                            that many people made the mistake of distinguishing ideologically
                            between these two, failing to take into account that the differences
                            between them stemmed from the circumstance that one was operating in a
                            governmental framework and the other in the party framework.</p>
                        <p>Chow resumed his account of the growth of Russian control in China. He
                            said that Mao had been highly flattered during his trip to Moscow the
                            winter before last. He had been paid respect beyond the measure allotted
                            to other satellite leaders and was told repeatedly that China was a
                            partner of the Soviet Union—a, partner almost equal to the Soviet Union
                            itself. Chow said that in this atmosphere of flattery and talk of
                            dignified collaboration, the Sino-Soviet treaty<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d83fn2">The text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of February 14,

                        <p>Chow said that when the Korean affair came up, the Soviet leaders turned
                            to China saying: “This is something in your sphere. As our main
                            partner—as the next greatest Communist power, you should take care of
                            this. This will mean sacrifices for you for a while, but the role of
                            world communist leadership is not an easy but an heroic one. Anyway, we
                            Russians will be making even greater sacrifices in the common cause when
                            the inevitable final struggle with the capitalist world occurs.”</p>
                        <p>Chow then continued:</p>
                        <p>As of last fall the Chinese were really afraid of attack, really believed
                            the United States planned to extend the struggle to the Chinese
                            mainland. In their view the logical way for the United States to do this
                            would be to get a lodgment in Korea, move northward against the
                            hydroelectric power sources of vital importance to the industry of
                            Manchuria. Chu Teh had made a speech last September to the effect that
                            the Chinese must watch to see what the U.S. intentions were. <pb
                                n="1658" xml:id="pg_1658" facs="0200"/>Chu Teh had said these
                            intentions would be shown by whether U.S. forces crossed the 38th
                            parallel, for if they crossed, it would mean that their intentions were
                            beyond the restoration of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> and
                            aimed at jeopardizing China. Chu had said that the Chinese could not
                            tolerate the United States’ forces getting into a position to threaten
                            the power sources for Manchurian industry.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese concurrently were sure of a U.S. landing at Shanghai and had
                            taken preparations for it.</p>
                        <p>Chow remarked that this might sound silly to us, but it was not silly to
                            anyone who understood the Chinese Communist mentality. He said it was
                            important to remember that their only window was on Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Chase asked whether the Chinese Communist leaders had their eyes open now
                            that the United States had manifestly not acted aggressively against
                            China. Chow said the critical question was not only as to having one’s
                            eyes open but also as to what windows were available for one to look
                            through.</p>
                        <p>Chase asked specifically whether the men of Peiping now saw that they
                            were misled in judging the intentions of the United States as
                            aggressive.</p>
                        <p>Chow said in answer:</p>
                        <p>The men of Peiping were solid in their view that the United States was
                            their enemy and that a U.S. war with Russia was a high probability.</p>
                        <p>They were persuaded by the logic of history that the Western powers would
                            be defeated by the Communist powers in such a war and that the
                            victorious emergence of the Communists were assured, with or without
                            war. This was the logic of history.</p>
                        <p>I said the following:</p>
                        <p>The logic of history was a subtle and theoretic thing; I preferred the
                            study of history to the study of the logic of history. The course of
                            recent history was strewn with the bones of regimes that had
                            underestimated the will and power of the United States. If war came it
                            would happen again.</p>
                        <p>We did not want war. This was not because we had doubts about its
                            outcome. On that we were assured. We would win. We had the strength. We
                            knew our capabilities. It would be a hard ordeal. We would suffer
                            greatly. But we would win. Anyone who consulted the data of our strength
                            would know this. Only those who took refuge in the logic of history to
                            avoid the plain lesson of the present facts could doubt it.</p>
                        <p>We wished to avoid that war not because of expectation of defeat but
                            because of our knowledge of the pain it would cause not only to <pb
                                n="1659" xml:id="pg_1659" facs="0201"/>ourselves but to all the
                            world. Such a war would be an ordeal for us but would be painful beyond
                            all experience to the nations we would defeat. We certainly hoped to be
                            spared the necessity of participating in such a human tragedy.</p>
                        <p>A further factor in our desire for peace was our anticipation of the
                            effect of a war upon the American spirit and American institutions. The
                            United States would certainly come out of a Third World War into a Roman
                            phase in its historical development.</p>
                        <p>Up to now we had attempted to deal with other nations on a basis of
                            comity, fairness and compromise. If we were forced to go through the
                            ordeal of a Third World War in the defense of our own national security
                            we would put all of those impulses behind us. We would have no
                            disposition to show mercy or consideration to any nation which had
                            helped our adversary.</p>
                        <p>It would be woeful for China if its rulers in their blindness caused
                            China to be in our adversary’s camp if and when a war should come. There
                            would be no possibility of China’s starting out in the camp of our
                            adversary and then shifting over when the tide of battle had definitely
                            shifted our way. During World War II we did permit Italy to make this
                            sort of a shift, but I was sure that Marshal Bagdolio would go down as
                            the last man to have saved his neck by being a turncoat. If China were
                            caught in the camp of our adversary at the outbreak of a world war it
                            would have to suffer the consequences to the bitter end. We could not
                            afford to show it mercy or consideration. It would probably mean that
                            the Chinese would be set back a century or more in their progress. We
                            would regret this. We would regret that the blindness of China’s rulers
                            had forced such a situation and such a choice upon us.</p>
                        <p>Men of reason and good will everywhere must now be thinking just as such
                            men had thought in the summer of 1914 and in the long months of anxiety
                            in 1938 and 1939. The thought uppermost in their mind was the urgency
                            for finding some way to avoid a tragedy.</p>
                        <p>Such a thought was strong in the minds of the men who determine policy in
                            the United States. Unfortunately the choice was not theirs. The
                            determining power was in the hands of the men who ruled in Russia and
                            who rule in China. It was particularly within the power of the latter to
                            choose a line of policy which would relieve the dangers of war or to
                            persist in a line of policy that would make war virtually inevitable.
                            The best chance of avoiding war was to create circumstances which would
                            give pause to men in the Kremlin. The best way to produce those
                            circumstances would be to create an independent course of action in
                            China as a substitute for the present Chinese line of subservience to
                            the world designs of Moscow.</p>
                        <pb n="1660" xml:id="pg_1660" facs="0202"/>
                        <p>During this part of the discussion Chow lost his ebullience. His face
                            became set and grave. He divided his time between watching me and
                            watching his plate. I was certain that my words had had a great effect
                            on him. I checked this impression with my companions and they were of
                            the same view.</p>
                        <p>After a brief pause Chow renewed the discussion by observing that I
                            seemed to have found all the faults to be on China’s side and asked
                            whether I did not think the United States had also made some mistakes. I
                            said that of course the United States had made mistakes and that an
                            errorless course of action was no more to be expected of a nation than
                            it was to be expected of an individual. I said that the circumstance
                            that all governments made errors could not be made the basis for
                            excusing tragic folly in the conduct of any particular. I asked Chow
                            specifically what he had in mind.</p>
                        <p>He said that it occurred to him that a great deal of the difficulty and
                            the impasse would have been avoided if the United States had early
                            recognized the Peiping Government as the dominant and sovereign power in
                            China.</p>
                        <p>I spoke as follows:</p>
                        <p>Personally I was inclined to agree with this point of view. I did not
                            regard recognition as a stamp of approval or as carrying any moral
                            quality or implying any value whatsoever. Recognition was just a conduit
                            for doing business.</p>
                        <p>In my view if the United States had problems with China those problems
                            should be dealt with through some channel. This meant that there should
                            be some regular channel of handling affairs between the two countries
                            and that in turn meant diplomatic recognition.</p>
                        <p>Chow appeared pleased and remarked that he was glad to find me in
                            agreement with him.</p>
                        <p>I resumed as follows:</p>
                        <p>So far I had spoken about the theoretic aspects of recognition. I wanted
                            to add something about the practical aspects because these bore upon the
                            present problem of relationships between the United States and
                            China.</p>
                        <p>We had recognized a number of the satellite countries in Eastern
                            Europe—all to no good purpose. Recognition of the regimes in Bulgaria,
                            Hungary, Rumania, Poland, etc., had not achieved the purpose for which
                            recognition was extended.</p>
                        <p>The reason for this was no deficiency in recognition as a channel, per
                            se. It was in the simple circumstance that the governments concerned had
                            lost their moral autonomy and were no longer capable of doing business
                            in their own right.</p>
                        <p>Any government which wanted to be recognized as a government was under
                            the compulsion to make sure that it remained in essence a government.
                                <pb n="1661" xml:id="pg_1661" facs="0203"/>One of the essential
                            characteristics of a government was its ability to enter into and carry
                            out contracts in good faith.</p>
                        <p>Every Chinese should ask himself the question whether the government at
                            Peiping fulfilled that test. We in the United States had looked with the
                            utmost anxiety upon the penetration of China by alien authorities
                            responsive not to Chinese needs or Chinese aspirations but to the will
                            and purposes of the Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>China was in the gravest danger—perhaps this had already occurred—of
                            becoming a colony to a new imperialism which went under the name of
                            anti-imperialism.</p>
                        <p>Chow responded heartily to this and said I had hit the nail on the head,
                            or words to that effect. Chow observed further:</p>
                        <p>Americans did not appreciate the emotions which guided the men of
                            Peiping. We should take more into account the prides and inward feelings
                            and emotional content of their minds.</p>
                        <p>They were dominated by a great resentment against the United States for
                            its persistent support of the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss>
                            against the Communists and there would be a long period of bitterness
                            and conflict before this emotion could work itself out.</p>
                        <p>I then spoke as follows:</p>
                        <p>It would be one of history’s most tragic paradoxes if a nation, namely
                            China, should be led into a terrible tragedy simply because of some
                            emotional feeling on the part of the men who ruled it.</p>
                        <p>We in the United States also had emotions but we had better sense than to
                            allow our emotions to rule our policy.</p>
                        <p>My own emotional impulse was that the United States should carry the war
                            to the Chinese mainland, destroy Chinese commerce and industry and teach
                            a terrible lesson to the men of Peiping for their affronts to my country
                            and for their destruction of American lives in Korea, all to the purpose
                            only of serving our enemies in the Kremlin. This emotion was shared by
                            our military establishment, by our diplomatic establishment, by the
                            public leaders of the United States, by our press and by President
                            Truman himself.</p>
                        <p>We put this emotion aside, however, and tried to be guided by reason in
                            the interest of humanity.</p>
                        <p>The consequences were always tragic when the rulers of nations attempted
                            to use public policy as a means of satisfying their own emotional
                            drives. It was certainly devoutly to be wished that the men of Peiping
                            would take a more reasonable and calculating view of their situation and
                            do it soon.</p>
                        <p>It would be a mistake to assume that the determination of the United
                            States to guide by reason and to withhold itself from indulgence of its
                            emotional impulses was limitless. There was certainly a <pb n="1662"
                                xml:id="pg_1662" facs="0204"/>point—I did not know where or when it
                            would be reached—at which the American people and their government would
                            say, “To hell with it. Let’s give the Chinese what they’re asking
                            for”.</p>
                        <p>Chase made the following observations:</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists did not appreciate the tremendous pressure under
                            which the government of the United States was being placed.</p>
                        <p>There was a growing demand in the United States for direct action against
                            the Chinese mainland and that this demand was not abated but was
                            actually intensified by occurrences in the sequel to the removal of
                            General MacArthur.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese were to make a mistake if they interpreted the MacArthur
                            removal as eliminating the possibility of direct action against the
                            Chinese mainland.</p>
                        <p>Chow said that the Chinese Communists had their own special
                            interpretation for the MacArthur issue. He particularized as follows on
                            this interpretation:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>At present the press was most interested in the conflict of the point
                                of view between General MacArthur and Secretary Marshall. This was
                                being presented as a conflict between two wings of American
                                capitalism. The first wing was dominant in the Eastern states and
                                centered in New York. It reflected the view of the American
                                capitalists who were interested in investments and business
                                opportunities in trade with respect to Europe. Marshall was seen as
                                the champion of this group. This group wanted to turn primary
                                attention away from Asia and towards Europe for the time being. The
                                other wing was dominant in the Middle West and in the Far West. It
                                represented a more traditional Republican point of view. Its
                                overseas concern was mainly in the Pacific area rather than in the
                                Atlantic. Its view was articulated by the mid-western members of
                                Congress and was reflected notably in the Chicago <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Tribune</hi>. Its champion was General MacArthur, who was from
                                Wisconsin, who had made his career in the Pacific and who was close
                                to the international circles of the Republican Party. This group
                                would make American capitalist stakes in the Pacific the primary
                                concern of the American foreign policy. It favored the re-conquest
                                of Asia as item number one on the American agenda.</p>
                            <p>Another element in the interpretation was that MacArthur had been
                                relieved because of a military failure. As the Chinese Communists
                                had interpreted the events to the public in China, MacArthur had
                                been sent north in Korea to cross the Yalu, penetrate Manchuria and
                                make war on China. He had misinterpreted the strength and timing of
                                the Chinese resistance, had made a bungle of the campaign and had
                                been removed for that reason. The United States was concealing its
                                chagrin by making rationalizations for the removal of MacArthur.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Chow said that from the American point of view, it was obvious that the
                            North Koreans had caused the aggression, but this was being with-held
                                <pb n="1663" xml:id="pg_1663" facs="0205"/>from the Chinese; they
                            were consistently being given the interpretation that the South Koreans
                            had been the aggressors and had acted at the instigation of the United
                            States and with close support of American forces.</p>
                        <p>Chase inquired as to how they explained away the circumstances that there
                            were obviously no American forces in Korea at the time that the fighting
                            occurred. He pointed out that General MacArthur had brought this out in
                            his testimony and that it was obviously the case in everyone’s
                            recollection.</p>
                        <p>Chow said that the Communist press in China had interpreted MacArthur’s
                            testimony in this respect as an alibi by which MacArthur was trying to
                            explain away his failures as a commander and to remove from his
                            reputation the onus of failure.</p>
                        <p>Chow continued as follows:</p>
                        <p>The notion of South Korean aggression was obviously without foundation in
                            fact to men who had free access to all the information. He had had an
                            editorial problem in the publication of his paper in Hong Kong. If he
                            had followed the Peiping Communist interpretation of events he would
                            have made his paper the laughing stock of everyone in Hong Kong.
                            Accordingly he had tried to be vague as to the identity of the aggressor
                            as of last June 25. He had always treated the subject by referring to
                            the long period of local sorties back and forth across the border and by
                            observing that apparently the sortie that had touched off all the
                            trouble happened to have been one made by the North Korean forces.</p>
                        <p>This had caused a great deal of criticism of his editorship by Communist
                            authorities and he had been reproved by the Editorial Supervisory Board
                            of his paper.</p>
                        <p>As a result he expected to be ousted as editor within the next month or
                            so.</p>
                        <p>He was in a difficult position because he had no way of getting an
                            explanation through to the authorities in Peiping as to the necessity
                            which caused him to put forth this interpretation. All Communist affairs
                            were handled by strict adherence to the chain of command and he was
                            forced to deal exclusively through the channels of the Chinese news
                            agencies and with the editorial board immediately above him.</p>
                        <p>Clough, Chase and I interpreted this last point as prompted by Chow’s
                            recognition that we were trying to give him a message to get over to
                            Peiping. He may have been signalling to us that he no longer had a
                            channel by which to get such a message through or he may have been
                            providing a cover for his intention to get the message over. It was
                            difficult to say which was the case.</p>
                        <pb n="1664" xml:id="pg_1664" facs="0206"/>
                        <p>In the closing phases of the conversation Chow commented on contemporary
                            conditions within China. He spoke as follows:</p>
                        <p>It was difficult to tell whether the war in Korea had been forced upon
                            the Peiping government as a means of stepping up its internal program or
                            as a consequence of stepping up its internal program.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the cause and effect of relationship might be, there was no
                            doubt of a direct and essential connection between the war and the
                            course of internal policy.</p>
                        <p>Concomitantly with the war the land reform program had been put through
                            ruthlessly. It would probably have been impossible to do this except in
                            the atmosphere of war.</p>
                        <p>Virtually everybody was better off than before the Communists had come
                            in. Minor bureaucrats had more power, were getting better pay and
                            enjoyed the situation of working in an effective government. Workmen
                            were generally much better off than previously and had benefited greatly
                            by the Communist policy of concentrating the food supplies in the cities
                            at the expense of the countryside. Small farmers were about as well off
                            as formerly. The tenant farmers were much better off, and only the
                            landowners had suffered.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of the conversation Chow made special inquiry as to how
                            long we would be in Hong Kong and where we were staying. I told him we
                            would be around for about one week. Chase emphasized that the time was
                            extendable in the light of what might turn up to challenge our continued
                            attention here.</p>
                        <p>Chow rode back to the center of Hong Kong with Chase and me. His whole
                            demeanor was of the utmost friendliness. He repeatedly expressed his
                            gratitude for having been given such a disclosure of the attitude of the
                            United States. He left us with an expression as to his appreciation of
                            the privilege of holding a free conversation with free men who still
                            enjoyed the privilege of free thought.</p>

                            other subjects, the possible need of some modification in the general

                            Mission in Formosa should conduct its relations with the Chinese

                            elsewhere, for the improvement of Chinese Government policies and
                            practices in the broad fields of agricultural reform, export and import
                            controls, industrial rehabilitation and in the basic field of fiscal

                            Mission should attempt to achieve the proper and effective use of
                            Chinese revenues from all sources as well as the most effective
                            utilization of American economic aid. To this end the <gloss

                            exercise of coordinated pressures, and should continue to assign as
                            observers on the Economic Stabilization Board representatives qualified
                            to provide sound technical and policy advice.</p>
                        <p>An important and relevant problem arises from Chinese military
                            expenditures on Formosa. It is probably inevitable that the military
                            establishment must continue to impose a heavy burden on the national
                            budget. It is not necessary, however, that its charges on Formosan
                            resources be so unpredictable, arbitrary, and irresponsible, in terms of
                            the social and economic consequences they produce, as to render sound
                            economic planning almost, if not completely, impossible. I have
                            requested Mr. Cabot to give careful and urgent consideration to the
                            feasibility of working out arrangements, perhaps as a condition for the
                            delivery of United States military assistance, for bringing under some
                            kind of rational control the military expenditures of the Chinese
                            National Government. If we can work out and then obtain the cooperation
                            of the Chinese National Government in such arrangements, they would
                            contribute basically to the prospects for the genuine and enduring
                            results which <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> is seeking in the
                            economic field. I am certain that Mr. Cabot will, in the near future be
                            inviting the cooperation of the Economic Cooperation Administration as
                            well as that of the Department of Defense in his study of this
                            problem.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Greenhill called today and read to me a message of April 30, 1951,
                            received by the Foreign Office from Mr. Leo Lamb, their Chargé at
                            Peiping, stating that the Chargé had failed to obtain an interview with
                            lower-level officials of the Communist foreign office to protest the
                            detention of United Kingdom, United States, Canadian and Australian
                            nationals in China. Mr. Lamb said that an attempt to see higher
                            officials during the May 1 celebration week would probably be fruitless.
                            Therefore he was sending a memorandum, along the lines of the text
                            already cleared with the Department of State,<note n="1" xml:id="d85fn1"
                                >See Clubb’s memorandum of conversation of April 10, <ref
                                    target="#pg_1625">p. 1625</ref>.</note> to the Communist vice
                            minister of foreign affairs on April 30.</p>
                        <p>In his message to the Foreign Office, Mr. Lamb suggested that at least a
                            week be allowed for the possible return of the memorandum by the
                            Communists without acknowledgment. This apparently has not occurred, but
                            the British now plan, with the agreement of the U.S., Australia and
                            Canada, to go forward with a public announcement about May 21 along the
                            lines of the attached draft.<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> Mr. Lamb had suggested that the announcement might
                            be either elicited by a question in the House of Commons or by an
                            arranged question from press representatives to the Foreign Office; it
                            is probable that the latter procedure will be followed, Mr. Greenhill
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Greenhill said the Foreign Office had suggested that the United
                            States, Canadian and Australian foreign affairs departments might wish
                            to simultaneously make similar (although not the same) announcements. He
                            said that the question was also being put before the Canadian and
                            Australian Governments and that he would appreciate having our views as
                            to the possible U.S. statement<note n="3" xml:id="d85fn3">On May 21, the
                                State Department issued a statement to the press expressing concern
                                Over the imprisonment by Chinese Communist authorities of more than
                                thirty American nationals, who had been denied access to legal
                                counsel and to British officials, and over the denial of exit
                                permits to some Americans who were trying to leave China. The
                                statement noted that the British Chargé at Peking had made
                                representations on April 30 on behalf of the Americans under arrest,
                                as well as the United Kingdom, Canadian, and Australian nationals in
                                that situation. For the text of the statement, see the Department of
                                State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 11, 1951, p. 947.</note>
                            and the timing <pb n="1667" xml:id="pg_1667" facs="0209"/>thereof. I
                            told Mr. Greenhill that I would immediately check and mentioned that in
                            our own announcement we would probably also like to note the situation
                            of Americans who have long been denied exit permits.</p>

                        <p>[Name deleted] was regarded in the political section of the Consulate
                            General as the person who had the surest channel to persons near the
                            center of authority in Peiping. …</p>

                        <p>Preceding the conversation I consulted with [name deleted] on tactics. It
                            was agreed I should volunteer remarks only about the idea of
                            establishing a secret contact to use in event it should ever become
                            propitious to approach the problem of restoring peace; that I should not
                            seek to pump [name deleted] for information and that I should not
                            attempt to bring up the topic of the U.S. attitude and policy; that if
                            he should make inquiries about them, I should give him the same line I
                            had given Eric Chow …, but with great reserve.</p>
                        <p>I opened the conversation by stating to [name deleted] the following:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I was in the line of policy at the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>I was in Hong Kong to study certain problems in relation to our Far
                                Eastern policy.</p>
                            <p>I understood that [name deleted] had told him of my presence and that
                                he had communicated this to friends in Peiping who had the ear of
                                those in authority.</p>
                            <p>This initiative on his part was interesting. It had given me an idea.
                                It seemed advisable for people on both sides of the quarrel to give
                                attention to how to go about settling it in event the times should
                                become propitious.</p>
                            <p>It was hard to see how the initial steps could be taken in the public
                                and somewhat rigid framework of the UN. It was difficult to set up
                                an official and overt channel between the governments.</p>
                            <p>It seemed therefore that people having access to the two governments
                                should establish a line of communication so that the chances for
                                peace would not be lost merely for lack of a way to open
                                conversations. It occurred to me off-hand that probably such talks,
                                if they ever should come to pass, would have to pass through three
                                stages. First it would be necessary to talk about having talks about
                                talking. If all went well, it would then be possible to go on
                                talking over arrangements for talks. At about that stage some
                                informal system of credentials would have to be set up so that each
                                party would know it was not being deceived as to the status of the
                                other. Finally, after some exchange of less informal credentials,
                                the process could advance to definite talks about a basis on which
                                to arrange an end to the conflict.</p>
                            <p>After such a basis had been agreed to—and only after that—it would be
                                possible to make public disclosures and proceed to formalize the
                                agreement through the UN or some other channel.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>[Name deleted] said this all seemed to make sense.</p>
                        <p>I said it might be opportune for us to get the idea into people’s <pb
                                n="1669" xml:id="pg_1669" facs="0211"/>heads in Peiping. I said I
                            was sure I was right in saying that my suggestion was compatible with
                            the highest official views in Washington. I suggested that the channel
                            to Peiping used to get through the message might be used in reverse in
                            event Peiping ever came to a more sensible view about the war in Korea
                            and saw its way clear to ending it.</p>
                        <p>[Name deleted] then asked whether he might make a statement. I assented.
                            He continued as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>[Name deleted] asked me whether I could give assurance that the United
                            States would not change its policy and attitude in the midst of efforts
                            on the part of [name deleted] and himself and others to arrange an
                            approach to peace. He said he wished to be sure that our moderate
                            position would continue and that they would not be left in the lurch
                            incident to a sudden toughening of policy or a sudden move toward full
                            war.</p>
                        <p>I told him the following:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I certainly could not give him such assurance.</p>
                            <p>I could not promise an unchanged attitude because I was aware that
                                the United States’ attitude toward the Korean struggle had already
                                undergone changes. For example, up until a few weeks before, that
                                    [<hi rend="italic">there</hi>] had been wide divergence of
                                opinion on the question whether we should continue the struggle.
                                Many had argued that we should get out and write the whole thing off
                                as something we had started without knowing how to finish it. Within
                                the past few weeks, however, the national will had become resolved.
                                No significant persons suggested that we should withdraw from Korea.
                                We were in there to fight the thing to a finish. Of that no doubt
                                could be entertained. It was up to the Chinese to decide what sort
                                of a finish it would be. It could be a settled conclusion of
                                hostilities by mutual arrangement, or it could be a conclusion
                                reached after untold bloodshed over a very wide front.</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>[Name deleted] inquired about the degree of urgency in getting messages
                            through and trying to lay the lines for conversations looking toward
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>I spoke as follows:</p>
                        <p>This was a question for the Chinese to answer, not for Americans.</p>
                        <p>We felt we were doing pretty well in Korea now. We were sure we could
                            stay on indefinitely. We would prefer not to have to, but on the other
                            hand the Korean venture was proving advantageous to us in getting our
                            army ready for its larger mission—that of forming a deterrent to the
                            Russians or, if war proved inevitable, of defeating the Russians.</p>
                        <p>One prospect that made the question urgent for the Chinese was the
                            prospect of war between the United States and Russia. It would be a <pb
                                n="1670" xml:id="pg_1670" facs="0212"/>tough and bloody war. United
                            States victory was pretty certain, but it would come only after a
                            terrible ordeal. We would be hard pressed and would certainly show no
                            consideration to any nation found in our enemy’s camp at the onset of
                            hostilities. If I were a Chinese I would be getting very anxious about
                            the possibility of protracting the Korean struggle until the full war
                            erupted. I would know that in that event it would be the end of China’s
                            hopes for perhaps a century.</p>
                        <p>A second prospect that should make the Chinese feel anxious was that the
                            United States would come into the fullness of its strength in about 18
                            months. That was a certainty—whereas war was problematic. The United
                            States was like any other nation in that its attitude in the fullness of
                            strength was likely to be different from its attitude in a more or less
                            necessitous situation. I could not promise what our attitude toward
                            China might become. I knew what it was at present. General Bradley had
                            just stated it very well in his testimony in Washington.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d88fn2">General Bradley had begun his testimony at the
                                MacArthur hearings on May 15.</note> We wanted a reasonable and
                            peaceful settlement and were ready for it any time the Peiping people
                            came to their senses. We might throw all that overboard at a later stage
                            of full strength.</p>
                        <p>More important than official statements was the attitude shown by the
                            American people. We had been fighting the Chinese now for some months,
                            yet no significant showing of hostility toward China had taken place.
                            Our press, radio, and other channels of opinion had reflected no
                            opprobrium for the Chinese. Chinese walked our streets and did business
                            in our country without fear of insult or injury. This was a new
                            phenomenon to us—to fight a passionless, rancourless war. It indicated a
                            residual friendship that the Chinese should be loath to squander. If the
                            Chinese nation should be able to reestablish rational control of its
                            policy and come to terms with us, it would be making an accommodation
                            with a friend, not coming to terms with an enemy.</p>
                        <p>Yet this very circumstance of passionless struggle contained a danger
                            that the killing of Chinese might become a sort of a habit with
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>My remarks about friendship for the Chinese people should not be
                            construed as indicating approval of their rulers. We made a clear
                            distinction. We regarded the men of Peiping as guilty of the blindest
                            and most reckless folly.</p>
                        <p>[Name deleted] said that it would be difficult, perhaps out of the
                            question, for the Chinese to come to a termination and settlement with
                            us in Korea if the United States and its allies should crow about the
                            matter as if it were a victory; that the Chinese could not swallow <pb
                                n="1671" xml:id="pg_1671" facs="0213"/>pride. He asked me what
                            assurances could be given in this regard. I said:</p>
                        <p>The Korean struggle was marginal to us. The big adversary was not China,
                            but the Kremlin. We would not be likely to waste a lot of time crowing
                            about a secondary development.</p>
                        <p>The same factors that had caused us to restrain our passions in the
                            fighting would likely cause us to restrain them if the fighting were
                            halted.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. had made clear that it sought not victory but a restoration of
                            the Korean situation conforming as far as possible in the circumstances
                            to what it was before the aggression.</p>
                        <p>But so far as lightening for the Chinese the burden of their
                            consciousness of not being able to finish what they started—that was
                            beyond our capability.</p>
                        <p>The conversation ended with a grave exchange of good wishes.</p>

                            500 (V), recommending an embargo on the shipment of arms, ammunition,

                            Foster Dulles, Consultant to the Secretary, discussed Sino-American

                                of the people of China, particularly their historic demand for
                                independence from foreign control. That Government will continue to
                                receive important aid and assistance from the United States. Under
                                the circumstances, however, such aid in itself cannot be decisive to
                                the future of China. The decision and the effort are for the Chinese
                                people, pooling their efforts, wherever they are, in behalf of
                                China.</p>
                            <p>“If the Chinese people decide for freedom, they shall find friends
                                among all the peoples of the earth who have known and love freedom.
                                They shall find added strength from those who refuse to believe that
                                China is fated to become a land of tyranny and aggression and who
                                expect China to fulfill the promise of its great past.”</p>

                            repeated what had been said by both the President and me many times in
                            the past. The attention given to this speech and the implications sought
                            to be drawn from it were the product of the present investigation on the

                                consists of traditional bandit and war-lord groups who have always
                                fought against the ruling authorities and whose activities are now
                                directed against the Communists as the ruling authority and of some
                                non-Nationalist anti-Communist groups. The guerrillas are virtually
                                uncoordinated, are poorly supplied, and operate in small bands. If
                                well supplied and coordinated, those guerrillas who are strongly
                                anti-Communist could form the core of a potentially effective
                                resistance movement.</item>

                                guerrilla forces presents difficulties to the achievement of these
                                objectives. Some non-Nationalist opposition groups might not
                                cooperate in a resistance effort which was under Nationalist
                                auspices, but an alternative leader capable of arousing all
                                anti-Communist elements has not yet emerged. It would, therefore, be
                                hard to build up an effective guerrilla resistance movement on the
                                mainland without the collaboration of the Nationalists in Taiwan.
                                Support for the anti-Communist, non-Nationalist resistance units
                                would be difficult because these groups do not possess a secure base
                                of operations. Opposition between Nationalist and non-Nationalist
                                forces is not likely to become acute unless guerrilla activity grew

                                            <p>“15. Full US logistical and operational support of a
                                                Chinese Nationalist invasion of the mainland would
                                                almost certainly be regarded by the USSR as a
                                                serious threat to its security interests in the Far
                                                East. Although we are unable, on the basis of
                                                intelligence, to determine what measures the USSR
                                                would take to meet such a threat, we believe that
                                                the USSR would take steps which would increase the
                                                risk of general war. So long as the Kremlin
                                                estimated that the existence of the Chinese
                                                Communist regime was not in jeopardy, we believe
                                                that the USSR, while giving support against the
                                                invasion, probably would not openly commit its own
                                                forces against US forces. If, however, the Kremlin
                                                estimated that the existence of the regime was in
                                                jeopardy, there is a serious possibility that the
                                                Kremlin would openly commit Soviet forces against US
                                                forces actively engaged in operational support of
                                                the invasion. We believe, however, that the Kremlin
                                                probably would not deliberately initiate a general
                                                war for the sole reason that its security interests
                                                in the Far East were thus threatened.” [Footnote in

                                acknowledge its support of the Chinese Communist regime. However, in
                                view of Soviet security sensibilities and the definiteness of
                                Moscow’s published commitments to Peiping, formal Soviet support of
                                Communist China under terms of the Sino-Soviet pact must be
                                considered a distinct possibility. In any event, if the Soviet Union
                                did provide major overt support to the Chinese Communists, it
                                probably would cite the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in an
                                effort to justify its actions before world opinion.</item>

                            <item>In view of the expressed US desire to avoid a general war, and of
                                the opposition of the Western European powers to the expansion of
                                any Far Eastern conflict into general war, the Kremlin might
                                estimate that a US–USSR conflict starting in China could be
                                localized in the Far East. On the other hand, the possibility cannot
                                be disregarded that the USSR might be willing, or even might desire,
                                to have a Far Eastern conflict expanded into a general war between
                                the US and the USSR, leaving to the US the responsibility for
                                initiating such a war and thereby exposing the US to the risk of
                                losing its most important allies. Indeed, at every stage from the
                                extension of covert aid to the initiation of local or general
                                hostilities, the USSR would probably seek to force the US to take
                                the initiative, and thereby to incur the onus of
                                “aggression.”</item>

                            <item>We are unable, on the basis of present intelligence, to determine
                                whether the Kremlin would be in fact willing to have a Far Eastern

                                making its decision, the Kremlin would undoubtedly take into

                                    <hi rend="italic">General</hi>. Several factors condition the
                                    vulnerability of the Chinese Communist regime to military
                                    action. Some of these are basic to China regardless of the
                                    regime in power. The internal transportation system is
                                    inadequate and there is consequently a tendency toward
                                    autonomous economic, social, political, and military regions.
                                    The low level of industrialization has forced China to depend on
                                    outside sources for all but the small and simple types of
                                    military equipment. The enormous population can provide an
                                    almost inexhaustible supply of untrained military manpower, but
                                    the general economic and administrative development of the
                                    country is so backward that neither the Nationalists nor the
                                    Communists have been able effectively to exploit China’s full
                                    manpower resources for military purposes. The almost complete
                                    lack of steel facilities and indigenous petroleum resources and
                                    the small output of the steel industry force China to rely on
                                    foreign sources for the support of its military
                                    establishment.</item>

                                <item>Other factors conditioning Chinese Communist vulnerability to
                                    military action are peculiar to the Communist regime’s present
                                    situation. The most important of these is the war in Korea,
                                    which has diverted a major part of Communist China’s military,
                                    transportation, and economic resources to meet the requirements
                                    of this large-scale operation. This in turn has prevented the
                                    Communists from carrying out their program of economic
                                    reconstruction and development. It has also undoubtedly delayed
                                    the complete consolidation of control over China proper,
                                    particularly in the areas of South China which were last to be
                                    “liberated” and which are most vulnerable to guerrilla attack
                                    and amphibious invasion. Finally, there have been indications of
                                    a growing dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. This
                                    dissatisfaction, although presently not serious enough to
                                    constitute a real danger to the regime’s control, represents a
                                    potential source of support to an effectively organized
                                    opposition movement.</item>

                                    areas of Southeast, South, and Southwest China are especially
                                    suitable for anti-Communist guerrilla operations. The population
                                    has been traditionally hostile to central authority from outside

                                    iron and steel and munitions industries are few in number and
                                    are principally concentrated in North China and Manchuria. They
                                    are all within medium bomber range of Taiwan, Okinawa, Japan and
                                    Luzon. Over 90 percent of these targets are within range of
                                    carrier-based aircraft. Thus, these installations are
                                    particularly vulnerable to air attack. Because China must import
                                    such critical items as petroleum, tanks, motor vehicles, heavy
                                    weapons, and aircraft, the weak and tenuous lines of
                                    communication are key targets for air attack or sabotage. The
                                    only available rail line capable of moving heavy equipment from
                                    Manchuria to China runs from Chinhsien to Tientsin along the
                                    coast and is vulnerable to naval bombardment as well as air

                                    essentially rural and could function, albeit at a low level of

                                    support of key industries, the Communist regime is largely
                                    dependent on foreign sources. China is also dependent on exports
                                    for obtaining needed foreign exchange. Moreover, a large portion
                                    of domestic commerce is carried in coastal vessels. China’s
                                    present vulnerability to a naval blockade is consequently high.
                                    A blockade would require Communist China to rely on the USSR for
                                    virtually all its import requirements and would restrict all
                                    shipments from the USSR to the already-burdened rail and road

                                    defend its coastal areas from invasion. The South China coast is
                                    particularly vulnerable because of its proximity to Taiwan and

                                <item>Between 600,000 and 650,000 Chinese on the mainland are
                                    believed to be active in organized or semi-organized groups
                                    opposing <pb n="1681" xml:id="pg_1681" facs="0223"/>the
                                    Communist regime. About half of this number are estimated to be
                                    under loose Nationalist control. The remainder consists of
                                    traditional bandit and war-lord groups who have always fought
                                    against the ruling authorities and whose activities are now
                                    directed against the Communists as the ruling authority and of
                                    some non-Nationalist anti-Communist groups.</item>

                                <item>By far the greater proportion of these dissidents are south of
                                    the Yangtze; most of them in the southeastern provinces of China
                                    (see Map).<note n="2" xml:id="d93fn4">Not reproduced.</note>
                                    There are perhaps 100,000 men in the various
                                    Nationalist-oriented guerrilla bands in the coastal Provinces
                                    south of Shanghai. Guerrilla forces in the mountainous interior
                                    are largely independent, but may be considered as a Nationalist
                                    potential. On the northwest perimeter of China proper, among the
                                    minority peoples mainly of the Moslem faith, there appears to be
                                    some guerrilla activity. Although far from contact with the
                                    Nationalist Government and anti-Chinese in feeling, these
                                    guerrillas might become part of the Nationalist potential if
                                    given guarantees as to their future autonomy and adequate
                                    support.</item>

                                <item>The resistance movement on the mainland now consists of
                                    virtually uncoordinated, dispersed, and very poorly supplied
                                    bands. The largest known groups consist of about 3,000 men. Even
                                    those who are claimed to be under Nationalist control are
                                    frequently without effective communications; moreover, rivalry
                                    exists among Nationalist governmental groups and officials on
                                    Taiwan for the allegiance of guerrilla forces. Despite the
                                    Communist campaign against the guerrillas during late summer of
                                    1950 and the ensuing winter, activity by resistance forces,
                                    particularly in Kwantung and Kwangsi, is continuing and may
                                    actually have expanded. A substantial part of these guerrilla
                                    units is probably motivated by strong anti-Communist feeling and
                                    could form the core of a potentially effective resistance
                                    movement.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>At the present time, there is no organized anti-Communist,
                                    non-Nationalist political resistance movement on the mainland or
                                    in Hong Kong. There are a number of small, uncoordinated groups
                                    of such dissidents, but they have no leader of sufficient
                                    stature to head an effective movement. The bandit and war-lord
                                    forces which are harassing the Communist regime could not be
                                    expected to give firm support to an organized anti-Communist
                                    movement except on terms advantageous to them.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The effectiveness of the guerrillas could be greatly increased
                                    by better supply and more competent organization, even though no
                                    new recruits were gained. If supply and organization were
                                    improved, <pb n="1682" xml:id="pg_1682" facs="0224"/>however,
                                    new recruits would in fact be added. Numbers would probably not
                                    grow much beyond 1,000,000 unless a substantial area of the
                                    mainland were secured by anti-Communist forces. At that time
                                    defections from the Communist ranks could be expected.</item>
                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>Under present conditions, there is little or no prospect for
                                    bringing about significant defections from either the Chinese
                                    Communist Party or Army. The Communist regime has thus far been
                                    able to control any dissident movement. Nevertheless, defections
                                    could be expected after the commencement of large-scale
                                    guerrilla or military operations on the mainland. The number of
                                    defectors would depend largely on the prospects of the
                                    insurrectionary movement’s success. If an area on the mainland
                                    had been made secure, defections could probably be stimulated by
                                    the use of the traditional “silver bullet” approach.</item>

                        <p>I have the honor to enclose a summary, as well as memoranda of
                                conversation,<note n="1" xml:id="d94fn1">The enclosures are not
                                printed.</note> regarding relations between the United States and
                            Tibet, which resulted from a visit recently made by an Embassy
                                officer<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">Fraser Wilkins, First Secretary
                                of Embassy in New Delhi.</note> to Kalimpong in West Bengal.</p>
                        <p>Although I realized that the Consulate General in Calcutta has been able
                            to maintain association with Tibetan authorities from time to time, the
                            Embassy’s direct knowledge of developments in Tibet and acquaintance
                            with Tibetan authorities has been limited in recent months because of
                            the Communist Chinese invasion of Tibet and because Tibetan
                            representatives now refrain from visiting New Delhi for fear of becoming
                            entangled with the Communist Chinese Ambassador here. In order to
                            re-establish our relations with Tibetan officials and to clear up a
                            number of outstanding questions, such as the export of Tibetan wool to
                            the United States and the purchase of gold by Pangdatshang,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d94fn3">Yangpel Pangdatshang was endeavoring to purchase
                                gold on behalf of the Tibetan Government.</note> I considered it
                            advisable to dispatch an officer from the Embassy to Kalimpong. Such
                            visit would also provide an opportunity to counteract recent reports
                            which indicated that important Tibetans were of the belief that the
                            United States had no interest in <pb n="1683" xml:id="pg_1683"
                                facs="0225"/>their welfare and therefore the Tibetans had no
                            recourse but to accept the demands of Communist China.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Department will find the enclosed summary and
                            memoranda of conversation of great interest. It is also believed that
                            the visit of an Embassy officer to Kalimpong at this particular time has
                            had a salutary effect on Dzasa Liushar, the Foreign Secretary, and on
                            Yangpel Pangdatshang, the elder brother of one of the most important
                            families of Eastern Tibet and one of Tibet’s wealthy exporters of
                            Tibetan wool.</p>
                        <p>It was discovered, for example, that while the Tibetan authorities were
                            in the midst of discussions with the Government of India regarding the
                            applicability of an Indian export duty on Tibetan wool, reports had been
                            received that the United States was no longer interested in importing
                            Tibetan wool. As the export of wool is a matter of the highest
                            importance to the foreign trade of Tibet and one on which substantial
                            numbers of the Tibetan people are dependent for a livelihood, the
                            Foreign Secretary was greatly concerned. It was his belief, if the
                            reports were true, that the American restrictions indicated, as did
                            other things, that the United States was no longer interested in
                            Tibet.</p>
                        <p>It was also reaffirmed that, because Tibet had received no response from
                            the United Nations and some of its member states with respect to its
                                appeal<note n="4" xml:id="d94fn4">Tibet had appealed to the United
                                Nations on November 13, 1950, regarding the Chinese Communist
                                invasion but the United Nations did not discuss the question.</note>
                            regarding Communist China’s invasion of Tibet in October 1950, the
                            Tibetan authorities had fallen into a dejected and fatalistic frame of
                            mind and appeared to be convinced that they would have to accede to the
                            demands of Communist China regarding Tibet. Although precise information
                            was difficult to obtain, it seemed likely that Communist China was
                            insisting on control over all of Tibet. Tibet, on the other hand,
                            appeared willing to make every concession, including such important
                            attributes of sovereignty as defense, external affairs and
                            communications, except autonomy for internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>According to the Foreign Secretary, the Tibetan Delegation, which
                            recently proceeded to Peiping, was on the eve of its talks with the
                            Communist Chinese. It was his belief that, even if the talks were to
                            Tibet’s disadvantage, Tibet would in the long run emerge unscathed.
                            Tibet really desired its full independence and close relations with the
                            United States. Meanwhile, it was the Foreign Secretary’s hope that we
                            would not be disheartened by little actions which they might be forced
                            to take.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Dzasa Liushar’s statements, he was immediately informed that
                            we were not aware of any important change with respect <pb n="1684"
                                xml:id="pg_1684" facs="0226"/>to the import of Tibetan wool into the
                            United States but was promised that the situation would be investigated
                            at once. Reference is made in this connection to the Embassy’s telegram
                            3258 of May 17, 1951,<note n="5" xml:id="d94fn5">Not printed.</note> in
                            which the Foreign Secretary’s remarks were reported and it was requested
                            that the Department discuss this matter with the Department of Commerce
                            and the Treasury Department. Since the dispatch of this information, the
                            Embassy has learned that associates of Pangdatshang in Calcutta have
                            received reports from American importers in Boston that Foreign Assets
                            Control regulations have been altered and now require statements from
                            Tibetan exporters and American importers to the effect that they have no
                            cause to believe that specified shipments of Tibetan wool have come from
                            those sections of Tibet which are under the control of the Chinese
                            Communists. As this does not appear to be the case, the Tibetan wool
                            exporters in Calcutta state that they believe Tibetan wool will continue
                            to go forward to the United States as usual.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, however, the Indian export duty of 30% has so cut the margin
                            between cost and sale price of approximately $1.00 per pound that
                            Tibetan wool may be held up for a strictly economic reason. It is
                            recalled, on the other hand, that the Tibetan authorities have already
                            approached the Government of India regarding this matter and they may be
                            able to obtain exemption or set up some form of bonding arrangement. The
                            Embassy, for its part, plans to lend such assistance as is proper to the
                            Tibetan authorities in achieving this objective.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Secretary was also informed of the interest which the United
                            States had manifested with respect to its international problems. The
                            statements of United States interest in the continuance of Tibetan
                            autonomy and sympathy regarding its appeal to the United Nations, based
                            on previous instructions from the Department, were recalled and
                            reiterated. It is believed that the Tibetan authorities appreciate the
                            significance of these statements although, for reasons of geography and
                            proximity to the new military power of Communist China, they feel they
                            cannot take advantage of them and rely entirely on the United Nations at
                            the present time.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy remembers that the Department has in the past expressed the
                            opinion that despite the lateness of the hour it does not believe that
                            Tibet should be lost by default. There seems little doubt that it would
                            be most unfortunate not only for the forces of freedom but also more
                            immediately for India if Tibet were woven into the fabric of Communist
                            China. Remote and unimportant as Tibet may seem to the western mind, it
                            nevertheless occupies a strategic and <pb n="1685" xml:id="pg_1685"
                                facs="0227"/>geographic position to the north of the Himalayas from
                            which countries as far east as Indo China and as far west as Pakistan
                            could become the object of Communist propaganda and infiltration. From
                            Tibet, India—the most important country in Southeast Asia—would be
                            constantly menaced. It therefore seems to us that we should exert every
                            opportunity to be of assistance to Tibet. It is our belief that such
                            assistance will be small and relatively insignificant in comparison with
                            assistance which the United States is supplying elsewhere but that it
                            will yield exceptional benefits. It is therefore suggested that the
                            Department give immediate consideration to various lines of action
                            including the following: <list>

                        <p>In brief, Shakabpa stated he personal representative Dalai Lama and had
                            come Calcutta for purpose seeking US advice what Tibet should do when
                            Tibetan-Communist Chinese talks at Peiping broke down. Shakabpa said
                            Tibetan Government had received word from Tibetan delegation at Peiping
                            that on May 13 talks “were almost at deadlock”.</p>
                        <p>Shakabpa said Communist China wanted suzerainty over all Tibet “as far as
                            Himalayas” including control defense and external affairs. Tibet would
                            be willing concede for Inner Tibet but Dalai Lama and Tibetan Government
                            wished autonomy for internal affairs and conduct own defense for Outer
                            Tibet. Dalai Lama adamant in refusing concede control defense to
                            Communist China and if forced do so either by pressure or extension
                            present Communist Chinese military occupation would immediately leave
                            Tibet.</p>
                        <p>Shakabpa also added that while passing through Kalimpong from Yatung to
                            Calcutta Dzasa Liushar had shown him Ambassador’s letter to Dalai Lama

                            carrying Yatung for discussion with Dalai Lama and Tibetan Government.
                            Embassy also considers highly important at this stage relations between

                            therefore exists this government which is reported sympathetic Communist
                            China may have been set up and itself approved agreement rather than

                        <p>On May 13 Dzasa Liushar told Wilkins Tibetan delegation did not have full
                            powers and all important points would have to be referred back to
                            Yatung. Shakabpa also stated Dalai Lama adamant in refusing relinquish
                            control Tibetan defense and if forced do by pressure or extension
                            Chinese Communist military occupation Tibet, would leave Tibet.</p>

                        <p>Embassy therefore believes official Tibetan announcement should be
                            awaited before accepting Peiping statement as conclusive. Meanwhile
                            Shakabpa’s questions re possible departure Dalai Lama from Tibet take on
                            added importance and should be answered urgently. Furthermore, Embassy
                            convinced US should demonstrate interest in Tibet in every practical
                            political and economic way; otherwise there is little doubt Tibet will
                            fall under complete Communist Chinese control by default.</p>

                        <p>3433. Interview with Bajpai yesterday was requested by Steere to

                            Indo-Tibetan agreement.</p>
                        <p>Bajpai stated text agreement just reed from Panikkar agreed with press
                            version in all substantial respects. Panikkar had commented <pb n="1692"
                                xml:id="pg_1692" facs="0234"/>very briefly, emphasizing that
                            agreement provided for trade and friendly relations with neighboring
                            countries. Bajpai intimated that Panikkar had failed to secure any info
                            during course of negots, and Steere gained impression <gloss

                            capitulation.</p>
                        <p>Bajpai endeavored gloss over fact <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            disappointed at Tibetan failure secure better terms and gave
                            unmistakable indication that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> feels
                            helpless in face this development and is likely accept it without
                            protest. He said India was heir to Brit policy which had sought achieve
                            buffer state in Tibet against Russia and Chi. <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> however was not disposed create or support buffer
                            states. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> however states throughout
                            centuries Chi influence and control in Tibet had fluctuated with
                            strength of regime in power. Weak Chi govts lost nearly all influence,
                            strong govts regained it. “It was inevitable that present Chi govt shld
                            gain control of Tibet, and there was nothing that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could do about it”.</p>
                        <p>Steere pointed out that announced <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            attitude was same as Brit had been; namely, recognition of Chi
                            suzerainty but with autonomy for Tibet, and that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> had maintained rep in Tibetan capital. He asked what
                            attitude of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> toward question wld be
                            in case Dalai Lama shld refuse approve agreement. Bajpai seemed
                            surprised and said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wld have consider
                            what attitude it wld then adopt.</p>
                        <p>Bajpai said he had impression from Tibetan del when in Delhi enroute
                            Peking that it had full power, but he did not seem positive. He added
                            del had requested Indian dipl support in negots; <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> had promised do what it could, but Tibetan del as far
                            as he knew, had never come near Indian Emb Peking. Steere remarked this
                            was not surprising.</p>
                        <p>Bajpai was asked whether developments wld not affect India’s position
                            such countries as Nepal, Bhutan, Burma, Korea. He admitted it wld, but
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had not had time fully consider
                            these matters. He then volunteered in confidence info that mil comite
                            had been estab to survey problem of defense northeastern and eastern
                            borders fol Chi Commie invasion of Tibet last autumn. Comite had
                            recently reported. Recommendations, which <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> was going implement, wld involve strengthening border
                            posts, improvement communications, particularly roads, and efforts
                            improve condition and morale of area inhabitants who had always been
                            neglected. He added, however, that India was not a power in mil sense
                            and there were definite limits to what she could do. He said <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> for example felt it could be of little
                            assistance militarily to Burma; nor could Burma help India. <gloss

                        <p>4. Question arises whether US should make any overt move this juncture
                            when attitude Dalai Lama towards agreement announced by Peiping not yet
                            clear. Neither Dalai Lama nor any responsible member or representative
                            Tibetan Government has indicated acceptance or approval alleged
                            agreement; we believe Dalai Lama and his advisers still in state
                            indecision as to what they should do. It looks like Peiping exerted
                            pressure on members Tibetan delegation to obtain agreement and now
                            trying through pressure prevail on Dalai Lama accept. So long as Tibet
                            Government remains silent it is difficult for US denounce agreement as
                            effort deprive Tibet its autonomy by pressure and threat of force. In
                            case Tibetan Government should announce refusal accept agreement we
                            believe US should be prepared issue sharp statement denouncing Peiping
                            machinations to force Tibetans under duress to abandon their long
                            established rights to autonomy. Such announcement should, of course, be
                            couched in such terms as not give undue offense to non-Communist China
                            by questioning Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. In meantime we think it
                            might be helpful if at press conference spokesman for Department in
                            response to query could say Department not prepared comment on alleged
                            agreement between Communist China and Tibet since only information re
                            conclusion such agreement has come from Communist Chinese sources and it
                            is by no means certain <pb n="1697" xml:id="pg_1697" facs="0239"

                            by Peiping.</p>
                        <p>5. We wld like at earliest possible moment have further discussion with
                            Shakabpa but cannot do so without being able make some kind replies his
                            various questions (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 3398, May
                            29). We realize these questions involve matters much delicacy and cannot
                            be answered without careful consideration all ramifications.
                            Nevertheless our ability answer some of them early date might affect
                            decision Dalai Lama as to future relations Communist China. Indeed
                            possible he might be postponing decision pending receipt replies from

                        <p>Attached are some reports<note n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            pulled from <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> files which present a
                            fragmentary but perhaps useful picture of Nationalist raiding operations
                            against the mainland during the past few months. Several of the reports
                            come from official, Nationalist sources. The Taipei radio <pb n="1699"
                                xml:id="pg_1699" facs="0241"/>has boasted of more raids to come. It
                            therefore appears that the Nationalists may be attempting to feel us out
                            on the subject in which case our present silence would logically be
                            interpreted as consent.</p>
                        <p>The following paragraphs summarize the highlights of the reports and
                            present some observations regarding the “legality” of the raids under
                            the Chinese Government’s “neutralization” undertaking.</p>
                        <p>A series of raids on points on the Chekiang mainland and the island of
                            Yuhuan, off the Chekiang coast apparently took place November 19–22,
                            1950. According to a US Army report (attached), the raid was made by
                            Nationalist “commando groups”, with the assistance of the Nationalist
                            Navy. … However, it is interesting to note that this report describes
                            only the hit-and-run attack on the outlying Communist-held island
                            “Yuhuan-hsien”, and makes no mention of concurrent raids on mainland
                            points. While the report describes the role played by Nationalist naval
                            units (gunboats), it indicates that the troops landed were guerrillas
                            (“from the Action Column of the Kiangsu-Chekiang People’s Anti-Communist
                            Assault Army, in cooperation with Nationalist elements in the Communist
                            Yuhuan-hsien Battalion”). The report describes in detail tactics used
                            and gives a glowing description of successes: 451 Communists killed, 210
                            wounded, 94 prisoners; rifles, ammunition, and miscellaneous booty
                            seized. All this was accomplished, it is said, by 992 Nationalist
                            “effectives”, of whom only 49 were killed.</p>
                        <p>The press carried reports of Nationalist guerrilla attacks “on Sanmen Bay
                            and Nanchen Island” on March 9. The Embassy was asked to investigate
                            these reports (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1047, April

                            press of an April 22 guerrilla raid in Wenchow Bay, again on the
                            Chekiang Coast. The guerrillas were said to have withdrawn after seizing
                            50 tons of rice and killing or wounding 400 Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>It is interesting to note that the Nationalists, in describing these
                            raids, have endeavored to make them appear “legal” under the
                            neutralization undertaking. On the surface it appears that their
                            reasoning might have some validity.</p>

                            Taipei radio broadcast (that raids would be launched from a
                            Nationalist-held island “Outside the sphere of the Seventh Fleet’s
                            patrol”) would appear to have little validity. The undertaking which the
                            Chinese Government accepted “in principle” made no reference to the
                            Seventh Fleet’s “sphere of responsibility” and hence our ban presumably
                            covers raids launched from Nationalist-held islands outside that sphere.
                            However, the two reports received … describe raids undertaken by
                            guerrillas against Communist-held “offshore islands”. The Nationalists
                            are perhaps reasoning that these raids are within the letter of the law,
                            since (1) they were allegedly undertaken by independent Nationalist
                            guerrilla units (not “forces under [the Gimo’s]<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d102fn7">Brackets in the source text.</note> command”), and
                            (2) they were directed against offshore islands (not “against the
                            Chinese mainland”).</p>
                        <p>Taipei radio, on March 26, referred to a December Nationalist raid on
                            “Yungwan” Island, off the Chekiang coast, and predicted that the
                            Nationalists may unleash “a series of limited amphibious operations to
                            recapture some small but strategically important islands off the South
                            China coast before this autumn, ‘in the name of guerrilla forces’.” It
                            is emphasized that these operations will be necessarily limited in
                            scope, “aiming at either the recapture of some small islands or staging
                            commando operations on a certain thinly defended part of the
                            Red-controlled China coast”. It is stated that Nationalist authorities
                            will exercise utmost care to observe our neutralization policy, and that
                            future operations must accordingly be launched from Kinmen and Taicheng
                            Islands (Nationalist-held), off the Chekiang coast, “both outside the
                            sphere of the Seventh Fleet’s patrol”.</p>

                            that the Nationalists are attempting to feel us out on the subject of
                            mainland and offshore island raids, by broadcasting their intentions in
                            this manner and, previously, by furnishing us … reports of raids
                            undertaken. In the case of the Yuhuan-hsien raid we received a detailed
                            account, apparently a “sales job” for our benefit. It is likely that
                            other raids have been undertaken without our knowledge. In any event, it
                            appears from the Taipei broadcast that more may be forthcoming. In the
                            absence of any reaction from the US Government to radio and press
                            publicity and official intelligence handouts, the Chinese Government is
                            likely to conclude that we do not consider these raids a violation of
                            the “neutralization” undertaking (or that we are condoning these
                            operations regardless of their “legality”).</p>
                        <p>These raids have certain obvious advantages from the standpoint of US
                            interests: 1. Only a few Nationalist troops are committed at any one
                            time, hence the results of a total defeat would not be disastrous from
                            the standpoint of the defense of Formosa and the morale of
                            anti-Communist elements in Southeast Asia and on the mainland; 2. No US
                            involvement has been necessary so far; 3. A certain amount of damage can
                            be done, perhaps to Communist staging centers along the Formosa invasion
                            coast; 4. Numerous hit and run raids up and down the coast might tie up
                            a considerable number of Communist troops for defensive purposes
                            (perhaps causing a greater diversion of troops than would result from an
                            all-out assault); 5. If the Nationalists are earnestly attempting to
                            coordinate mainland guerrilla operations … and have any support among
                            mainland anti-Communist elements, these raids should afford them an
                            opportunity to establish communications and perhaps furnish
                            supplies.</p>
                        <p>These are points which Defense … should properly weigh. …</p>

                        <p>2. I asked what his opinion attitude <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            wld be if Dalai Lama wld repudiate treaty; insist it obtained duress
                            from del without authority to make such agreement. Bajpai said he did
                            not know. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> thus far had taken it for
                            granted Dalai Lama wld accept treaty as best terms obtainable. He
                            personally thought matter one between Dalai Lama and Peiping. If former
                            shld refuse agree to treaty he thought <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> wld find it difficult regard treaty as legal document.
                            If after rejecting treaty Dalai Lama shld ask for asylum in India <gloss

                        <p>3. I said seemed to me this treaty if accepted wld mean end Tibet
                            autonomy and advance Commie Chi to Indian frontiers. I cld not see how
                            India cld view such development with equanimity. In my opinion wld be to

                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> requests that the Generalissimo
                            come forward with his own recommendation for control arrangements. We
                            will not be precluded from revising his proposals. We believe it
                            important, however—quite as much for the effect produced in Southeast
                            Asia as in Formosa itself—that when we proceed with working out the
                            precise arrangements under which we will subtract from the
                            Generalissimo’s sovereignty in the field of military administration, we
                            make as our starting point proposals which he himself has advanced and
                            not arrangements of our own which he could construe as an explicit
                            ultimatum.</p>
                        <p>Our <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> contains the veiled inference
                            that military and economic assistance may not be forthcoming, in maximum
                            amounts, unless the Chinese come forward with acceptable arrangements to
                            bring their local military expenditures under control. This contingent
                            aspect of our programs could be lost on the Chinese if the <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> is not presented until after
                            Congressional consideration of the Foreign Assistance Program for Asia
                            has begun. Therefore, we consider it to be of the greatest importance
                            that the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> be presented at once.</p>
                        <p>My recommendation is that, if you approve of the telegram we propose,

                        <p>Ambassador Koo stated that the National Government had already expressed
                            its need for additional economic and military aid in the <pb n="1704"
                                xml:id="pg_1704" facs="0246"/>coming year as compared with last
                            year. The matter of economic aid had been discussed with <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> at Taipei. Here, too, more was needed
                            than in the previous year. When $50–60 million (<gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1951) were allocated for economic assistance to Formosa,
                            for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952 there would probably be
                            needed about $70 million,<note n="*" xml:id="d105fn1">Corrected by phone
                                by Minister Tan Shao-hua June 7 to $75 million. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> the increase being due to what might be called
                            economic “impact costs” arising from an increased military program.
                            Estimates of requirements for military aid had been presented to
                            Minister Rankin in mid-February, with the request having then been made
                            for $82 million for the next three months. The figures presented last
                            autumn were of course larger but were for the whole year. In mid-April
                            the National Government gave the Embassy three copies of a supplementary
                            request for military aid. Under the military aid program they “would
                            expect” to get additional amounts of planes, tanks, guns. For the proper
                            utilization of this war matériel it would be necessary to meet what
                            might be called military “impact costs” falling into two categories,
                            namely, (1) $133 million military impact costs in foreign currency to
                            purchase additional food for the nutrition of the troops, clothing,
                            textiles, petroleum products, and (2) approximately $54 million local
                            currency costs which would have to be spent by the National
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Noting that the military aid bill was evidently to be presented to the
                            National Government all in one package, Ambassador Koo said that the
                            National Government was interested in getting a reply to the question
                            “Where do we stand?”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk confirmed that by present intentions the military aid program
                            would be presented to Congress in an omnibus bill. He was not certain
                            that it had yet been formally presented to Congress for their
                            consideration. In that bill, as it will probably be passed, there would
                            of course be no specification of definite amounts for particular areas
                            such as Formosa. In any event one prominent question would be that of
                            the availability of military supplies: the passage of the bill did not
                            mean necessarily that the goods would be instantly forthcoming. When
                            hearings were to start on that bill was unpredictable. Mr. Rusk asked if
                            there had not been discussions respecting the matter with <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and General Chase on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo confirmed that there had been such discussions. He asked
                            what the time-table of the bill’s passage would probably be. Mr. Rusk
                            said that it was to be anticipated that the bill would have heavy going,
                            that its course was uncertain, that almost certainly a considerable time
                            would ensue before its passage. The question was left on the suggestion
                            that it might not pass until early fall.</p>
                        <pb n="1705" xml:id="pg_1705" facs="0247"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo referred to the testimony of General Omar Bradley in the
                            current Senate hearings to the effect that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> had reported that $300 million were to be provided for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1952. Mr. Rusk said that he was
                            uninformed in respect to the particulars, and it was to be noted in any
                            event that this was an over-all sum.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo said that more <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid was
                            needed, that there is at the present time a gap which worries the
                            National Government, that there are growing economic difficulties
                            confronting Formosa. It is desirable that somehow or other some “timely
                            aid” be supplied to fill that gap. He noted that there was a surplus
                            existing in the European <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> funds,
                            noted that some surplus had already been transferred, and wondered
                            whether there could be an additional transfer for the purpose of
                            enabling the National Government to tide over the present difficult
                            period—which would presumably last until new <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> funds became available. Mr. Rusk replied that the
                            question arose whether there had not already been transferred all that
                            it was possible to transfer by the existing authority. He noted that in
                            the case of such transfers it was of course necessary to consult
                            Congress and effect only such transfers as were within Congress’s
                            authorization.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo said that it was the Nationalist feeling that <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> was sympathetic to the Nationalist
                            needs, and wondered whether the matter was not primarily a political
                            question. He was unable to define clearly the reason why the question
                            might be considered “political”. He referred again to the big surplus
                            existing in the European funds, and was told by Mr. Rusk that it would
                            be necessary to consult Congress in case there was contemplated any
                            transfer in excess of existing authority.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo next referred to the difficult foreign exchange position
                            now occupied by the National Government, and referred to it as a
                            separate problem from that of economic aid. He stated that in the
                            current year there had been sold 200,000 tons of sugar netting $30
                            million (U.S.?). The new sugar crop, although substantially increased in
                            acreage, will not be harvested until the end of September, and until
                            that time there will exist a serious gap in the “foreign exchange
                            requirements”. The <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> people at Taipei
                            have given certain advice with respect to the foreign exchange position,
                            and the Nationalists are consequently cutting down the import
                            requirements. They nevertheless need approximately $5 million monthly
                            for the next six months. There has already been some inflation in
                            Formosa. The Nationalists have the project of raising $30 million on the
                            security of next year’s sugar crop, which will yield, it is estimated,
                            500,000 to 550,000 tons. Two hundred thousand tons would be offered as
                            security. The arrangements might be made in two manners: (1) either by
                            advance sale of the sugar crop, with payment in advance, or (2) by the
                            making of a straight loan on <pb n="1706" xml:id="pg_1706" facs="0248"
                            />that part of the crop as security. In both instances the National
                            Government would plan to repay the advance (or loan) by the end of May
                            1952.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Koo said that they had approached the Ex-Im Bank with respect to the
                            matter in point, but that the Bank had indicated disinterest because it
                            is concerned with strictly commercial propositions, and this is
                            considered partly political. Mr. Clubb asked why the Ex-Im Bank
                            considered it partly political, and Dr. Koo replied that presumably it
                            was because of the political uncertainties surrounding the island.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Koo said, in response to a question from Mr. Rusk, that the proceeds
                            would be used in meeting import requirements in excess of those now
                            covered by <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> action. Heretofore the
                            National Government has been meeting the deficit from their reserves and
                            with <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid. In the event that there is
                            failure to meet those needs, public confidence would be shaken. Those
                            imports are required. Mr. Clubb asked what particular imports in
                            addition to those now made possible by <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> aid were needed for Formosa. Dr. Koo replied that they
                            were primarily consumption goods such as, for instance, cotton
                            cloth—only a part of Formosa’s current needs being met by <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid. Formosa has only about 40,000
                            spindles, and no raw cotton.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo said that the Nationalists had taken soundings in
                            commercial circles respecting the possibility of making a loan on the
                            sugar crop only to discover that, while commercial interests considered
                            that the loan was o.k. as a commercial proposition, there still existed
                            (as in the case of the Ex-Im Bank) the question of “political security”.
                            It was hoped that if the United States Government were approached by
                            commercial interests they would give a favorable report in respect to
                            the security aspect.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question from Mr. Rusk, Ambassador Koo said that this
                            loan, although somewhat similar to the currency stabilization project,
                            would in fact be used only to meet international payments. He said that
                            the problem had already been discussed with <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rusk being called from the room, Mr. Clubb asked Ambassador Koo what
                            would happen in respect to the budget plans of the National Government
                            if they spent their income from the sugar crop in advance as now
                            projected and then were called upon to repay the advance by the end of
                            May next—and thus were left short of the funds that they would otherwise
                            have. Ambassador Koo replied that he himself had queried his Government
                            in respect to that very point, but that their reaction was that they
                            would “cross that bridge when they came to it”. Mr. Clubb asked whether
                            there was not a possibility that the export of pineapples—previously a
                            large export item—could go some distance toward meeting the foreign
                            exchange deficit. Ambassador <pb n="1707" xml:id="pg_1707" facs="0249"
                            />Koo remarked that the previous market in Japan particularly had been
                            largely lost, that the Japanese had bought some bananas but were
                            uninterested in obtaining more of even those. (Mr. Cornelius Roosevelt
                            in a conversation later in the day reported that the Nationalists lost
                            their pineapple market because of the export of inferior product after
                            V–J Day.) Ambassador Koo remarked that the world sugar price was
                            somewhat up, and expressed (somewhat halfheartedly) the hope that
                            perhaps the United States could purchase some. It was remarked that the
                            United States obtained its main supplies from Cuba and the
                            Philippines.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Koo expressed the hope that some encouragement could be given
                            in respect to this matter of the foreign exchange deficit. This could be
                            done preferably through the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> who are
                            themselves apprehensive of the situation in that regard. Mr. Rusk said
                            that there were fundamentally two questions, one, of the balance of
                            international payments, and the other, of currency stabilization. The
                            latter question was complicated and difficult. We would, however, have
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> take a look at the whole
                            problem.</p>

                            msg meant that if there were any prospect assistance from US, Dalai
                            Lama, who was opposed terms Sino-Tibetan agreement and was determined

                            US. Shakabpa agreed, however, it wld be wiser Dalai Lama remain India or
                            Ceylon and thoroughly understands importance their doing so. Shakabpa
                            also understands US cannot assume any responsibility personal expenses
                            Dalai Lama and retinue. Shakabpa considered US willingness receive Dalai

                            important points US response.</p>

                            appreciated reaffirmation US promise based on certain conditions limited
                            mil assistance but pressed for more definite statement re help through
                            loans money. Shakabpa informed more definite statement cld not be made
                            as wld depend developments Tibet; nevertheless US was prepared give
                            consideration act in [<hi rend="italic">action?</hi>] which might be
                            effective in encouraging Tibet regain and maintain autonomy. Shakabpa
                            considered this aspect sitn another most important point US response.

                        <p>Re US informal rep under question 5, Shakabpa hoped some American

                            22. Based on convs with Shakabpa it also seems probable Tib will wish

                            and these associates now assure him that the plans of the stockholders
                            have high backing in the headquarters of their firm.</p>

                            handed Thai Amb ltr from Comite for a Free Asia, Inc. addressed to Secy
                            which contained fol substance:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The Comite has followed with sympathy flight of Dalai Lama and his
                                brave but unsupported resistance to demands and threats of Chi
                                Commie Govt. His continued silence since Peiping reported agreement
                                May 23 between Peoples’ Central Republic and Tibetan local Govt is
                                indicative his non-acceptance of terms. It is our belief that Dalai
                                Lama is both a symbol and potential leader of Asian resistance to
                                Communism. As such he has become religious and polit refugee without
                                suitable asylum.</p>
                            <p>“The Comite for a Free Asia desires make contribution provision of
                                asylum but of necessity limited to moral encouragement and some
                                financial assistance. Asylum in the US wld be far from ideal for it
                                wld take him away from peoples of Free Asia and from direct contact
                                with the followers of Buddha. Of the various Buddhist countries to
                                which Dalai Lama might go Thailand combines profound devotion to
                                Buddha with proud record of independence and has taken lead among
                                Asian countries in resisting Communism. Moreover for centuries Thais
                                and Tibetans have been neighbors and allies. In such atmosphere of
                                common religion the Dalai Lama might feel at home.</p>
                            <p>[“]If Thai Govt wld extend asylum to Dalai Lama and entourage and wld
                                proffer him a suitable invitation to that effect the Comite for a

                                The US Government cannot however go forward with prospect of
                                successful implementation of the program for Formosa without
                                assurances that the National Government of China will cooperate

                                island under planned control. Therefore the US Government requests
                                as a matter of urgency that the National Government of China
                                formulate and propose for urgent consideration by and discussion

                        <p>A memorandum of June 22, 1951, from Policy Planning Staff Director Nitze
                            to Kenneth C. Krentz, drafted by Charles Burton Marshall, commented on a
                            report on Third Party’s activities after his departure from the United
                            States. Nitze’s memorandum stated that the attachment (not filed with
                            the source text) raised some interesting questions because of
                            discrepancies in the views stated by Third Party in his indirect
                            conversations with Marshall and the views he expressed after leaving the
                            United States. It stated that he was represented in the attachment as
                            “doubting the existence of any real or potential cleavage in the Chinese
                            Communist party” and “criticizing the withholding of Formosa from the
                            Red Chinese” and that he had apparently “let on” that “he was doing a
                            job in the U.S. more or less as an agent of Peiping” although “his faith
                            in the effectiveness of the independent groups in Peiping”, as reported
                            in the attachment, was “quite consistent with what was adduced in
                            interviews in this country.” The memorandum speculated as to whether
                            Third Party was dissimulating in his conversations in the United States
                            or after his departure or was “just naive and behind the times” or “just
                            a self-seeker without much sense of direction.” (S/P Files: Lot 64 D

                        <p>Nye<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">Sir Archibald Nye, High Commissioner for
                                the United Kingdom in India.</note> listened closely particularly to
                            reasoning substance of which was we regarded Sino-Tib agreement as
                            additional evidence aggressive intentions Chi Commies; agreement
                            emasculated Tib autonomy which we had recognized; we considered it
                            incumbent upon us, therefore, if Dalai Lama rejected agreement, not only
                            to express sympathy and support to Tibs themselves, but to make our
                            attitude clear before world on such important event. I also observed
                            that if <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> or Tib Govt did not soon
                            reject agreement Tib autonomy wld be gone forever.</p>
                        <p>Nye said that he had expressed view to <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> following announcement Sino-Tib agreement that <gloss

                                accompli</hi> and take no action that might disturb relations with
                            Chi Commies. He had also recommended that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                >HMG</gloss> attitude shld be recognized paramount interest Ind in
                            Tib and keep step with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> re this
                            matter. Nye agreed to further conversations soon as he cld prepare
                            himself; eventually talk fixed for today.</p>
                        <p>Nye began with questions on assurances given Tib reps. In particular had
                            we committed ourselves to make official statement of US sympathy for
                            Tibs regardless attitude of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> (or UK)
                            or before <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> might indicate its
                            attitude. I said we generally committed to making statement if <gloss
                                target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> rejected Sino-Tib agreement. Tenor and
                            timing wld depend considerably upon Tib statement. We wld probably want
                            to make our statement soon after Tibs.</p>
                        <p>Nye observed that US statement might show attitude differing with Ind and
                            therefore embarrassing to Ind and that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> was likely take offense at and even regard as
                            unfriendly, such US statement particularly if made without consultation
                            with or prior advice to <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. He even
                            thought that <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> in such event might
                            find itself leaning toward Ind rather than US side in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I replied that US statement, if made, wld be based upon attitude US (and
                            UK) had long maintained toward status of Tib, i.e. recognition of
                            autonomous Tib under Chi suzerainty. Ind only few months ago had
                            confirmed similar attitude. We proposed maintain that position, <pb
                                n="1720" xml:id="pg_1720" facs="0262"/>and not recognize even
                            tacitly, <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> by Commie Chi. I cld not
                            see what basis <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wld have for
                            objecting on substantive grounds to statement maintaining US attitude,
                            if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> shld decide change its position
                            which we hoped it wld not do.</p>
                        <p>I also said under my instrs our conservation was to endeavor find common
                            basis for both of us approach <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> with
                            view enlisting Ind support if possible for some practical assistance to
                            Tibs in their dilemma. It was also my intention inform <gloss
                                target="#t_MEA1">MEA</gloss> about Emb convs with Tibs soon as
                            possible (<gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss> 2252 para 1). I
                            therefore did not think <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had basis
                            for taking offense at course US following.</p>

                            took above remarks extremely well, it seemed, as also hope I expressed
                            he might agree that we both shld rep to <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> that it in Ind national interest for <gloss

                            asylum in India.</p>
                        <p>We discussed advent Chi del and bearing on Tib statement. Nye at first
                            thought not necessarily serious if del arrived and proceeded Yatung, but
                            finally seemed accept Emb view that Tib declaration before Chi arrival
                            best.</p>
                        <p>Nye suggested <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> and Dept might
                            usefully examine legal aspects of Sino-Tib agreement in re Tib autonomy.
                            I agreed. We agreed Nehru absence Kashmir wld impede <gloss

                            might not be bad.</p>
                        <p>Conversation concluded with Nye stating it most useful and he wld
                            communicate <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> for further instrs.</p>

                            agreement as being unacceptable in its terms and as going beyond powers

                            and with respect to the issuance of visas to these representatives for
                            entry into the United States.</p>
                        <p>Following the receipt of these telegrams, the Embassy communicated with
                            the Tibetan representatives at Kalimpong by mail. As no replies were
                            received and as the matters under discussion were of some importance,
                            copies were forwarded to the Dalai Lama on April 4, 1951.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the Dalai Lama’s response of May 21, 1951 was written
                            before the conclusion of the Sino-Tibetan agreement at Peiping on May
                            23, 1951. In view of subsequent developments it is of interest that the
                            Dalai Lama on May 21 apparently anticipates that it might be necessary
                            for Tibet again to approach the United States for help.</p>

                            US Govt with ChiGovt. Most important evidence US purpose depends on

                            direction Chinese affairs will be afforded depends upon your exercise
                            tact, perseverance and firmness and in causing Chinese to adopt these
                            plans and directions as their own. By “direction” in foregoing we mean
                            providing vigorous, clear and persuasive guidance. Such guidance to be
                            undertaken by some practical method whereby competent American authority
                            may exercise, jointly with responsible Chinese military and civilian
                            officials, effective supervision over budgeting and expenditure of
                            Formosan resources and funds for support of military establishment and
                            civilian economy. Exercise greater authority would however entail
                            out-right assumption responsibility for Formosa which would conflict
                            with basic US policies both with respect to Formosa and Far East as a
                            whole. Our job, in short, is to cause Chinese on Formosa to undertake

                            Shakabpa told Thacher he had recd and already answered five questions

                        <p>Thacher states replies which Shakabpa told him he had made to foregoing
                            questions seem accurately to reflect US Govt’s position as previously
                            communicated to Shakabpa. Implications of fourth question are, however,
                            extremely disturbing. Shakabpa, who seemed personally aware of dangers
                            of cooperating with Chi Commies, told Thacher he knew of no plans in
                            this connection. However on June 29 when discussing same point, Shakabpa
                            expressed opinion not over 50 percent of Tibetan officials had clear
                            understanding of implications of present situation faced by Tibetan
                            Govt.</p>
                        <p>In his conversations with Tibetans, Thacher has evidently reiterated US
                            position skillfully and Shakabpa has given repeated assurances he has
                            made forceful representations to Yatung. Shakabpa appears to have been
                            unable, however to persuade Dalai Lama to act and Thacher has clear
                            impression that Tibetan Govt unable make up its mind.</p>
                        <p>In discussing proposed US Govt statement, Shakabpa emphasized that since
                            Tibetans had never recognized Chinese suzerainty, he hoped <pb n="1727"
                                xml:id="pg_1727" facs="0269"/>our statement wld not mention
                            suzerainty in any way. As Thacher requests instrs on this point,
                            comments of Dept or Emb wld be welcome.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">The
                                Department replied in telegram 4 to Calcutta, July 3, 1951: “Dept

                                be merely told that his views had been made known to this Govt.”

                                Office of Chinese Affairs. The director of the office, Oliver Edmund
                                Clubb, and John Paton Davies of the Policy Planning Staff were
                                suspended on June 27, 1951, pending hearings by the State Department
                                Loyalty Security Board. The Department announced on July 30 that
                                Davies had been cleared and returned to active duty; his domestic
                                tour of duty was to expire the following month and he was then
                                scheduled for assignment to Bonn. On March 5, 1952, Secretary
                                Acheson told a press conference that the Board had determined that
                                Clubb was a security risk; he had appealed his case to the Secretary
                                who had overruled the Board’s finding and reinstated him, and he had
                                subsequently resigned. For the text of the Department’s
                                announcements concerning the two cases, see the Department of State

                        <p>Messrs. Burrows and Belcher of the British Embassy called on Mr. Merchant
                            today at their request to discuss Tibet. In response to Mr. Burrows’
                            general query, Mr. Merchant briefly sketched the background of our
                            thinking and gave an account of our recent relations with the Tibetans
                            along the lines which had been given to the UK High Commissioner in New
                            Delhi by our Chargé.</p>
                        <p>The discussion brought out that the British were concerned with bringing
                            the Indian Government more into the picture, particularly as regards any
                            moves the U.S. Government might make or contemplate making. Mr. Burrows
                            made the point that the Indian Government might be useful in the very
                            aims which we wished to achieve, and that, contrarily, if the Indians
                            were left without any knowledge of such matters as a statement to be
                            issued by the U.S. or our support of a UN <pb n="1728" xml:id="pg_1728"
                                facs="0270"/>appeal, their attitude might actually be adverse; thus
                            the Indians might help if their cooperation was enlisted and they might
                            definitely hinder our efforts if it was not. Mr. Burrows, evidently
                            acting under instructions, made it fairly clear that the British
                            Government’s attitude and action toward the Tibetan question, including
                            the possible repudiation by the Dalai Lama of the Peiping agreement,
                            would likely closely follow the lead of India (whether or not India had
                            first been brought into the discussions).</p>
                        <p>The British representatives also pointed out the importance of timing,
                            particularly as related to the Korean armistice negotiations before us.
                            Mr. Merchant assured them that we had this very much in mind, and it was
                            pointed out that we had freedom of action both as to the timing and the
                            scope of any comments we might make if the Dalai Lama decided to disavow
                            the agreement. It was noted that the question of the support this
                            Government would give the Tibetan case in the UN would depend on the
                            type of appeal made by the Tibetans and in the light of the fact that
                            the interests of many other member nations besides our own were
                            involved.</p>

                                Dalai Lama summarizing his conversations with U.S. representatives

                            proceed USA regardless <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss>’s advice and
                            wld tele <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> was doing so. Said he wld

                            proceed to USA. Taktser reasoned that if, as appeared likely, situation
                            in Tibet <pb n="1729" xml:id="pg_1729" facs="0271"/>shld deteriorate in

                            in Washington where he cld maintain contact with US Govt. He thought
                                <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> wld probably agree when informed

                            forced sign agreement on Chi terms and had been denied opportunity refer

                            sign or “there wld be war”. [Name deleted] had also told Taktser that
                            throughout stay in China they had been “as in an iron box” and had been
                            continuously watched and followed. They had seen Mao but not Chou. [Name
                            deleted] was evidently disturbed re consequences their action. Later
                            Taktser had recd call from all four Tib delegs who had anxiously queried
                            him as to probable reaction in Yatung. He had not seen Chi del.</p>

                            connection.</p>
                        <p>The Report and Recommendations, which had previously received my
                            concurrence and that of the Chief of the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> Mission, were first handed by General Chase to General
                            Chou Chih-jou, Chief of the Chinese General Staff, who reviewed them,
                            had a translation prepared, and transmitted the original and translation
                            to the Generalissimo as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Before
                            the translation was sent to the Generalissimo, however, it was reviewed
                            by American officers with a knowledge of Chinese and found to be
                            accurate.</p>
                        <p>After the Generalissimo had studied the Report and Recommendations, a
                            conference was arranged for June 27 in the Generalissimo’s office. Those
                            attending, besides the Generalissimo, included General Chou Chih-jou,
                            Director-General Wang Shih-chieh, Dr. Moyer of <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss>, General Chase of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            and myself. Dr. Shen Chang-huan, the Government Spokesman, acted as
                            interpreter.</p>
                        <p>General Chase reviewed and added explanatory remarks to various <pb
                                n="1731" xml:id="pg_1731" facs="0273"/>points in this report. There
                            seemed to be agreement in principle on all recommendations in so far as
                            their implementation lies within the province of the Chinese Government.
                            Toward the end of the conference, which lasted for an hour and a half,
                            the Generalissimo asked me whether I had any further comments to make. I
                            remarked that while agreement had been expressed on virtually every
                            point which came up for discussion, the Generalissimo at the outset had
                            indicated that there were some points on which he disagreed. I inquired
                            whether he wished to discuss these on the same occasion. He replied that
                            he would deal with them in a written communication. I then said that any
                            suggestions we were making to the Chinese Government, whether in
                            military or economic fields, were intended to improve the effectiveness
                            of the Chinese military establishment and to contribute to the economic
                            well-being of the people of this island—not for doctrinaire political
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the above conference General Chase received the following
                            letter dated June 27, 1951:</p>

                                        is a highly centralized ‘Empire’, guilty of hoarding much
                                        matériel presently needed by the troops for training and
                                        operations. The Divisions have to go back to rail-heads and
                                        bring up their supplies on the backs of their men.</p>
                                    <p>“10. There is, throughout the Armed Forces, a highly
                                        objectionable system of Political Commissars, that acts to
                                        penalize initiative and under-mine the authority of
                                        commanders of all echelons.”</p>

                                study carefully in consultation with you the concrete measures that
                                should be adopted to implement your recommendations. I am confident

                            same time maintaining his position on these points, appears to be the
                            opening move in a renewed Sino-American contest over the manner <pb

                            aid is to be utilized. The differences over Combined Services may prove
                            less important than the Generalissimo apparently had feared, since the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> desires only to improve the
                            effectiveness of this organization—not to abolish it. The question of
                            political commissars, however, lies close to the center of the gap which
                            separates American and Chinese thinking in a field at once ideological
                            and practical. It is intended to pursue this matter firmly and
                            consistently on the practical basis of establishing the authority of
                            military commanders in a degree commensurate with their responsibilities
                            and, in general, promoting morale and mutual confidence. Unquestionably
                            the Chinese Government must have means of coping with subversion and
                            espionage among both the Armed Forces and the civil population. There
                            must also be appropriate provision for indoctrination and morale
                            building among the troops in particular. However, informed Americans and
                            many if not most Chinese military officers consider the present methods
                            used in both fields to be seriously defective. With the possible
                            exception of the actual apprehension of spies, it seems likely that more
                            harm than good is being accomplished as regards the effectiveness of the
                            military establishment. (See Embassy’s despatch No. 4 of July 2, 1951,

                            intentions toward Tibet. Little opportunity given Tibetans present their

                        <p>2. We have no reliable evidence that reverses in the Korean war have
                            created a rift among the higher Chinese Communist political and military
                            leaders. Rumors suggest, however, that dissatisfaction with the course
                            of events in Korea may have accentuated differences of view that already
                            existed among them. There is fairly reliable evidence that military and
                            political figures of secondary importance have become uneasy over
                            China’s involvement in Korea and its isolation from the West. On the
                            other hand, several factors have tended to insure party solidarity, such
                            as the lifelong isolation from nonCommunist Western influences and the
                            common ideological conditioning of most Chinese Communist leaders, the
                            mutual interest they have in maintaining a united front among themselves
                            and with the Soviet Union, and the strength of party discipline.</p>
                        <p>3. The initial Chinese popular reaction to intervention in Korea appears
                            to have been one of pride in victory, and even the later holding actions
                            were viewed as triumphs when compared with the long series of Chinese
                            humiliations in the past. As the war has gone on, popular
                            dissatisfaction with the regime, already in evidence before <pb n="1739"
                                xml:id="pg_1739" facs="0281"/>the struggle began, has been
                            intensified by heavier taxes and levies in kind, increased conscription
                            and militia duties imposed on an already war-weary people, purges,
                            further disruption of the traditional Chinese family system, and other
                            harsh repressive measures. In addition, there is evidence from reliable
                            sources that among certain of the more educated groups, including some
                            ardent supporters of the regime, misgivings have developed about the
                            regime’s relations with the USSR and the USSR’s intentions with respect
                            to China and Korea.</p>
                        <p>4. The decline of popular support and the apparent necessity to impose
                            greater restrictions and demands upon the home front have resulted in
                            the regime’s speeding up its efforts to consolidate further its control
                            of the country. Terroristic measures to suppress “counterrevolutionary
                            activity” have been reinforced by positive steps to strengthen the
                            public security system, to centralize and expand militia units, and to
                            increase membership in the Communist-directed “people’s organization.”
                            The regime has also been required and probably will have to continue to
                            maintain large military forces within China to assist in preserving
                            order. While the control measures have thus far been successful in
                            checking the development of an effective opposition, their harshness has
                            lost to the regime the willing cooperation of at least some community
                            leaders, educators, engineers, and others whose prestige, training, and
                            technical skills the regime has regarded as essential to the furtherance
                            of longer range political and economic planning. In the long run, these
                            developments might have serious effects on the stability of the
                            regime.</p>

                        <p>5. There is insufficient evidence upon which to base a complete estimate
                            of the effect of the Korean conflict on the Chinese Communist economy,
                            which, though it has to support an urban population of over 60 million,
                            is undeveloped industrially and preponderantly agrarian. It is entirely
                            possible that any such effect would not be apparent within as short a
                            period as has elapsed and it is improbable that satisfactory statistical
                            evidence of such effects would be quickly or readily available to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>6. It seems almost certain that the demands of the Korean war have
                            limited the Peiping regime’s reconstruction efforts to those projects
                            requiring only the investment of labor, such as the building of dykes,
                            irrigation systems, airfields, and roads.</p>
                        <p>7. Although the regime has been successful in preventing the prices of
                            domestic goods from rising sharply, inflationary pressures have built up
                            since mid-1950, and Western trade restrictions and rising world prices
                            have resulted in precipitous price rises for certain imported strategic
                            raw materials and manufactured products.</p>
                        <pb n="1740" xml:id="pg_1740" facs="0282"/>
                        <p>8. Foreign trade with the West was at high levels in 1950. We estimate
                            that during the first quarter of 1951 this trade at least remained at
                            the 1950 levels, primarily because of the sharp increase in imports
                            chiefly of strategic materials through Hong Kong. Data on Western flag
                            shipping with Hong Kong and Chinese Communist ports since 1 April
                            indicate that such shipping has fallen off significantly and we believe
                            that the volume of trade has correspondingly declined. We believe that
                            Western trade restrictions are almost entirely responsible for this
                            decline in shipping and that these restrictions will have an
                            increasingly adverse effect on Communist China’s import capabilities
                            during the remainder of the year. Smuggling and trade from Communist and
                            non-Cooperating non-Communist nations will probably increase and will
                            offset to some extent the effect of these restrictions.<note n="2"

                                    primarily because of the sharp increase in imports, chiefly of

                        <p>9. Since the industrial sector of the Chinese Communist economy operates
                            virtually on a day-to-day basis, both in terms of raw materials and
                            plant maintenance, effective curtailment of imports is likely seriously
                            to affect Chinese Communist industry. There have been shortages for some
                            months of petroleum for civilian use and of certain fairly important
                            specialized industrial items. Very recently as a result of raw cotton
                            shortages textile mills have shut down. The Communists assert that they
                            are related to import difficulties as well as to the failure of the
                            cotton collection program in China itself. However, we believe the
                            munitions industry, in spite of reports of plant dispersals and raw
                            materials shortages, is producing at capacity and expanding.</p>
                        <p>10. During the large initial troop movements northeastward in the summer
                            and autumn of 1950, there were serious interruptions in the rail
                            movement of non-military goods throughout China. Since that time,
                            although military traffic has presumably interfered with the general
                            distribution of goods throughout China, and particularly in Manchuria,
                            and although there have been recent indications of delay in the movement
                            of individual non-military shipments, there is no <pb n="1741"
                                xml:id="pg_1741" facs="0283"/>evidence that the aggregate volume of
                            traffic outside Manchuria in essential non-military items has been
                            sharply curtailed.</p>
                        <p>11. The diversion of draft animals and manpower to military purposes has
                            impeded agricultural production in China, but the country is not likely
                            to face a critical over-all food situation in 1951.</p>
                        <p>12. Although such evidence as we have does not suggest that the Korean
                            conflict has as yet posed a critical threat to the economic stability of
                            the Chinese Communist regime, the Korean war has forced the Chinese
                            Communists to modify their program of long range economic development
                            and to place their economy on a war footing, has subjected the nation to
                            economic sanctions imposed by the Western world, has increased
                            inflationary pressures, and has strained the economic relations between
                            urban and rural areas. These factors are likely to increase the economic
                            difficulties of the government during the next year.</p>
                        <p>13. The Korean war has increased Peiping’s present economic dependence on
                            the USSR from two points of view. In the first place, we believe that
                            the Chinese Communists do not have the industrial resources to meet
                            their requirements for continued operations on the scale of the Korean
                            campaign over an extended period for even the type of military equipment
                            now being used by them in Korea. In the second place, the increased
                            East-West tension that followed the outbreak of hostilities in Korea is
                            resulting in more effective Western trade restrictions.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">III. <hi rend="italic">Military Effects of Korean
                                War</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14. The Korean war has resulted in the deployment of major portions of
                            Communist China’s best military forces in Korea and/or Manchuria. Supply
                            requirements of the war are taxing heavily Communist China’s limited
                            logistic capabilities. In addition, guerrilla activity and increased
                            unrest have required the commitment of large military forces within
                            China for the maintenance of internal security. We estimate, therefore,
                            that present Chinese Communist capabilities for military operations
                            elsewhere have decreased as a result of their participation in the
                            Korean war.</p>
                        <p>15. The Chinese Communists had an estimated 277,000 troops deployed in
                            Korea on 19 June 1951. In addition, it is estimated that they had 11
                            armies and elements of 4 armies and special units in Manchuria totalling
                            358,000 men. These units constituted a major portion of their best
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>16. Chinese casualties in Korea are estimated to have been 577,000 as of
                            16 June 1951, including roughly 73,000 non-battle casualties and 16,500
                            prisoners of war. Among these casualties have been an undetermined but
                            considerable number of the better trained and politically <pb n="1742"
                                xml:id="pg_1742" facs="0284"/>more reliable troops, including
                            officers and non-commissioned officers who will be especially hard to
                            replace. There are indications that the units committed earlier were of
                            a higher caliber than those recently encountered by the United Nations
                            forces. Morale appears to be lower among Chinese forces in Korea than it
                            was initially and the rate of capture of prisoners of war has increased
                            greatly. However, Chinese Communist personnel losses in Korea probably
                            have not yet seriously affected their over-all military strength.</p>
                        <p>17. Despite heavy losses, the total estimated strength of the Chinese
                            Communist Field Forces increased from 1,770,000 on 1 October 1950 to
                            1,947,000 on 9 June 1951. Military District units and the Militia have
                            also been strengthened.</p>
                        <p>18. Losses of matériel in Korea have been considerable. Most of the
                            equipment which was not Chinese-made was of US and Japanese origin.
                            Communist China’s output of high explosives and military equipment,
                            including artillery, is insufficient to keep up with the expenditures
                            and losses of matériel in Korea and Communist China has no motor vehicle
                            and aircraft industries. Consequently, as the original stocks become
                            depleted, the Peiping regime is becoming increasingly dependent upon the
                            USSR for logistic support.</p>
                        <p>19. Relatively few Soviet ground force weapons and little ground force
                            equipment have been found in the hands of Chinese Communists in Korea.
                            There are a number of fairly reliably indications, however, that tanks
                            and heavy equipment are being supplied and that some training in their
                            use is being afforded to Chinese Communist units in Manchuria;
                            additional reports, probably with some basis in fact, state that the
                            Soviets have agreed to equip and train Chinese Communist divisions. We
                            estimate that there are 10,000 Soviet military advisers throughout
                            China, and that there are some 3,000 such advisers with the Communist
                            forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>20. The Chinese Communist Air Force has been steadily expanded,
                            especially by the addition of jet fighters supplied by the USSR. The
                            Chinese Communists, with a total of approximately 1,000 aircraft
                            available to them, now possess a far greater air capability than they
                            had at the outset of the Korean operation.</p>
                        <p>21. The USSR has provided almost all the aircraft, aviation equipment,
                            and supplies now available to the Chinese Communist Air Force, and there
                            is substantial evidence that it is now supplying the <gloss
                                target="#t_CCAF1">CCAF</gloss> with radar, antiaircraft equipment,
                            and technical personnel. It is probable that Soviet or other non-Chinese
                            “volunteer” personnel are operating many of the aircraft currently
                            available to the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>22. The USSR has provided the Chinese Communist Navy with <pb n="1743"
                                xml:id="pg_1743" facs="0285"/>advisers, technicians, and training
                            personnel, and possibly a few old submarines of the smaller types.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">IV. <hi rend="italic">Effects on Sino-Soviet
                                Relations</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>23. Official pronouncements and propaganda indicate no appreciable
                            friction between Communist China and the USSR, but on the contrary
                            suggest that the coordination of foreign policy and propaganda and of
                            military, economic, and social planning between the two countries has
                            continued and perhaps increased during the Korean War. However, reports
                            from sources of unknown reliability indicate dissatisfaction on the part
                            of both Soviets and Chinese with the Sino-Soviet alliance. As there
                            would appear to be many areas of conflicting interest and potential
                            friction between the Chinese Communist and Soviet regimes, including
                            possible rivalry for control of Korea, these indications are not
                            inherently improbable. Any genuine Sino-Soviet friction would doubtless
                            be concealed as long as possible.</p>

                                the Chinese Communists. Some of your advisers probably think that
                                they understand the Chinese Communists and can make a bargain with
                                them. We do not think they understand Communism or the record of its

                                but were forced to do so. However, the world is beginning to think
                                that you do not object to the agreement because you have made no
                                statement about it. We think you should make this statement soon
                                because the Chinese Communists are sending a delegation to Yatung
                                through India. If you make your statement before they reach India,
                                it should make it difficult for the Chinese delegation to come to
                                Tibet. If you do not make such a statement, we think that Tibetan
                                autonomy is gone forever.</p>
                            <p>The only access we have to Tibet is through the country of India. It
                                is therefore important that Tibet tell India what you now want to do
                                and persuade India to help you or permit other countries to help
                                you. We don’t know for sure but we think it possible India will
                                permit help because although India now seems friendly with the
                                Chinese Communists we know many Indians are fearful of the
                                Communists near India.</p>
                            <p>We ourselves are willing to help Tibet now and we will do the
                                following things at this time: <list>

                                        India, Thailand or Ceylon in that order of priority because
                                        then you will be closer to Tibet and will be able to
                                        organize its resistance to the Chinese Communists. Although
                                        we haven’t consulted India, we think it would let you come
                                        to India because it said you could come last year. We
                                        haven’t consulted Thailand or Ceylon but we will ask them if
                                        you can come if you want us to talk to them. If you are

                                        through India, We think, however, that you should first ask
                                        India for arms and, if they cannot give them to you, ask
                                        India for permission for other countries to send them
                                        through India, If you are able to organize resistance within

                                        loans of money to keep up the resistance, spirit and morale
                                        of the Tibetan people. This is important if Tibet’s autonomy

                                        impelled to seek asylum outside of Tibet. We will discuss

                                successful implementation of the program for Formosa without
                                assurances that the Govt of China will cooperate effectively in
                                bringing its military and civilian expenditures on the island under
                                planned control. Therefore, the US Govt requests as a matter of
                                urgency that the Govt of China formulate and propose for urgent

                            are planning return to Yatung seventeenth because of instructions from
                            Dalai Lama and because of their property in Tibet. Shakabpa believes
                            Dalai Lama’s plans for returning Lhasa are firm. Shakabpa has
                            reluctantly agreed ask Dayal if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will
                            receive Dalai Lama in India although in absence of authorization from
                            Dalai Lama to approach Dayal in this connection, contact will be
                            informal and Shakabpa believes on basis past experience will be
                            fruitless. At Shakabpa’s request Gibson will wait in Kalimpong for
                            Shakabpa’s report of conversation with Dayal. If <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> will receive Dalai Lama, it must so inform Dalai Lama
                            before Shakabpa arrives in Yatung or Shakabpa will advise Dalai Lama no

                            had been informed Dayal had no instructions from his govt. Shakabpa
                            conveyed this info to Vice Consul Gibson who was in Gangtok and who then

                            inform Dutt (<gloss target="#t_MEA1">MEA</gloss>) along lines proposed
                            in <gloss target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>, except that I did not
                            directly suggest invitation <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> to visit
                            India. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has several times indicated
                            to Emb its firm view that first approach re any such visit shld be made
                            by Tibetans and early in conversation Dutt stated that <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> did not wish to take any action that
                            might be construed as attempt to influence <gloss target="#t_DL1"
                                >DL</gloss> or Tibetan decision in Tibetan relations with Commie
                            China. It did not seem expedient therefore to do what cld have been
                            regarded as pressure.</p>
                        <p>I stressed to Dutt, however, belief held in Wash that Tibetan del
                            subjected duress in Peking, and indications that <gloss target="#t_DL1"
                                >DL</gloss> might not have freedom of action to make decision accept
                            or reject Sino-Tibetan agreement, also US policy of sympathy and support
                            where feasible for nations seeking maintain their independence and our
                            view that <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> shld have opportunity to
                            make free decision. In conclusion I said it was greatly to be hoped that
                            some way might be found to give <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> such
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Dutt had very little to say but did state that <gloss target="#t_DL1"
                                >DL</gloss> had been informed of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>

                        <p>At the suggestion of a mutual friend, Ed Lockett, General Claire
                            Chennault made an appointment and came in to see me today. He is in this
                            country on leave, having left Formosa only nine days ago. I had known
                            him slightly in China and we had a pleasant and, so far as I was
                            concerned, informative talk. I gained the impression that he had dressed
                            himself carefully and come to the State Department in the general
                            attitude of holy water dealing with the devil.</p>
                        <p>At the outset he started off by saying that he thought the truce in Korea
                            was a mistake because it would release Chinese military attention for
                            operations against Burma or Indochina or Formosa and possibly all three.
                            He also elaborated at some length his theory that if we <pb n="1761"
                                xml:id="pg_1761" facs="0303"/>bombed with conventional weapons
                            Mukden and the lines of supply from Mukden to the Yalu, we could reduce
                            in two months the tonnage of supplies moving up to the front by 33⅓%,
                            which would make it impossible for the Communists to maintain an
                            effective force on the battle line.</p>
                        <p>I did not debate him in detail but referred to the Joint Chiefs’
                            testimony and the MacArthur hearings.</p>
                        <p>I questioned the General in detail on conditions on Formosa. He said that
                            K. C. Wu<note n="2" xml:id="d153fn2">Governor of Taiwan Province,
                                Republic of China.</note> has done a remarkable job and that in the
                            past two years economic conditions have improved and the attitude of the
                            Formosans toward the mainlanders has notably changed for the better. He
                            described Formosa as the most peaceful country in the entire Far East
                            with the exception of Japan. On guerrillas, he says there are
                            comparatively few under the direction and effective command of the
                            National Government, but that this is due only to lack of communications
                            and lack of materiel. Both, he says, are being remedied from Formosa and
                            he believes that, given communications facilities and adequate supplies
                            of weapons and ammunition, it is within practical possibility to
                            organize a million guerrillas responsive to the Generalissimo in China
                            south of the Yangtze. He seemed to me very realistic in discussing the
                            difficulties, the present ineffectiveness of guerrilla bands and the
                            fact that many of them are nothing but bandits who are described as
                            guerrillas by whatever government is in power. Kueichow, he says, is in
                            a state of continuous uprising. He is hopeful also about conditions in
                            all of Yenan [<hi rend="italic">Yunnan</hi>], Kwangtung and Kwangsi.</p>
                        <p>General Chennault said that a considerable build-up by the Communists,
                            particularly in air preparation, is going on on the invasion coast. The
                            Amoy airfield has been lengthened to 8000 feet, paved, and its
                            foundation greatly deepened. It can handle jets and heavy four-engine
                            stuff. Similarly at Fuchow and a set of fields slightly in the interior,
                            important preparations are being made. Flights of jets apparently come
                            in one day and leave the next, down the coast as far as Canton and then
                            back.</p>
                        <p>According to the General, morale in the <gloss target="#t_CAF1"
                                >CAF</gloss> is poor because they are scared to death of jets,
                            having none themselves. He expects raids against Formosa almost any
                            week. <gloss target="#t_CAF1">CAF</gloss> is still flying P–40s and a
                            few P–38s and P–51s. They have “busted up” the last of the 250
                            Mosquitoes they got from Canada.</p>
                        <p>General Chennault was lyrical in his praise of Karl Rankin and on three
                            occasions urged that he be named Ambassador, first because he deserved
                            it and second because this would give a lift to the Nationalist morale.

                            protest. I then went into a considerable explanation of the importance
                            of securing an effective treaty which would permit the liquidation of
                            the occupation and pointed out that with Nationalist participation this
                            was impossible, I explained that there was no intention to embarrass or
                            needlessly impair the prestige of the Nationalists and that it is this
                            Government’s earnest desire to handle the matter in the most friendly
                            possible but effective manner. General Chennault seemed greatly
                            impressed and I am hopeful that he will do some good on this issue.</p>

                        <p>There has been considerable speculation that any cooperation of the
                            Chinese Communists in cease-fire talks in Korea would result in
                            increased <pb n="1765" xml:id="pg_1765" facs="0307"/>Chinese pressure
                            elsewhere in Asia. It is believed appropriate, therefore, to review the
                            mass of intelligence reports available and to endeavor to ascertain
                            whether such pressure is likely to occur. The following recent
                            developments can be evaluated as “true” or “probably true”.</p>

                                sharply with the open pro-Communist psychological reaction which
                                followed the Chinese Communist initial success in Korea last

                                is simultaneously creating a USSR “sphere” as a buffer area between

                            <item>With the consolidation of internal administrative control and with
                                the development of increased dependence on the USSR, there will
                                probably be a weakening of the united front which previously existed
                                among key Chinese leaders. Thus, there have been increasing reports
                                of friction between Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai, and Mao. It is of
                                interest that numerous recent articles coming from Communist China
                                concerning the history of the Chinese Communist party have praised
                                only Mao, and have found fault, in at least minor respects, with
                                some of the other leaders. It is yet too early to know whether a
                                large group inside China is opposed to Chinese dependence upon and
                                subservience to USSR; however, it is reasonable to expect that
                                success in imperialistic programs in the Middle East and southeast
                                Asia will tend to enhance the confidence of those Communists who are
                                “ambitious nationalists” as well as Communists.</item>

                            <item>It is inevitable that the rapid increase in the Chinese armed
                                services will decrease proportionately within the armed services
                                command control by old-line Communist party men who were experienced
                                in the long fight against Chiang Kai-shek. There have been recent
                                reports of defections of small militia units and isolated army units
                                to guerrilla bands. Furthermore, there is some evidence of the
                                development of a Whampoa clique of Army officers who oppose the
                                dependence on Moscow.</item>

                            <item>Communist China losses of men and material in Korea have been
                                serious and cannot quickly be replaced. Despite reliable evidence of

                                and of increasing supplies of material along China’s east coast, it
                                is unlikely that in the near future the Communists will launch an

                                Kong; A major assault on Taiwan would constitute premature

                                Communists can expect at least US and possibly UK or UN forces to be
                                involved. In addition to its commercial usefulness, Hong Kong is
                                valuable as a blackmail weapon to be used in encouraging friction
                                between the UK and US.</item>

                                <item>Re Catholics, Chou said Commies had ample evidence it was

                                    even teach Christianity. However, Chou made it plain there was
                                    no room for foreigners actively seeking converts.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>As regards exit permits for businessmen, Chou admitted there

                                    businessmen always wld be welcome in Chi, and emphasized desire
                                    of Chi trade with West, pointing out that in 1950 Chi trade with
                                    West appreciably greater than trade with East (Lamb comments

                                    obligations incurred by their principals, Chou said he was
                                    willing to look into matter, but warned he cld not intervene if
                                    action taken was in accordance Chi law.</item>
                            </list>

                        <p>Panikkar feels Chou’s responses were generally encouraging, and that he
                            is prepared consider any reasonable case, Lamb reports. However, Lamb
                            himself comments he sees little evidence which wld justify optimism,
                            Chou’s refs to Chi security laws being particularly ominous. But Lamb
                            feels Panikkar has provided convenient opening for possible
                            representations, and therefore intends proceed with discussions with

                        <p>In forwarding summary, Lamb noted Panikkar probably did not intend report

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dean</hi>: I am very much disturbed to learn
                            that there has been a change in the plans of our relationship to a
                            Chinese Third Force movement. I have put a great deal of effort into
                            laying the groundwork with the Philippine government for them to accept
                            such a movement in principle and to give some practical, concrete form
                            to this acceptance. Given the feeling of the Filipinos toward the
                            Chinese, this was no easy task. Had we proceeded to assure the
                            Philippine government of our willingness to accept responsibility for
                            the activities of Third Force leaders here—a responsibility we could
                            meet by exerting influence on these leaders, and had we clarified in
                            Chiang Kai-shek’s mind the fact that the Third Force is not
                            anti-Nationalist, but anti-Communist and so supplementary to his
                            efforts, it is incontestable that we should have gone a long way toward
                            the creation of an effective anti-Communist instrument.</p>
                        <p>The fact remains that there are large areas—political and
                            geographical—where the Nationalists under their present leadership have
                            no influence. Nor can any increase in Taiwan’s military potential give
                            the Nationalists influence in these areas. The Chinese Communists,
                            through terrorism at home and subversive activities abroad, are
                            organizing all Chinese in support of their regime and they are
                            increasingly successful <pb n="1772" xml:id="pg_1772" facs="0314"/>in
                            this because they meet no organized opposition. It appears to me that it
                            is our responsibility to develop and organize this opposition in areas
                            where Taiwan has no influence, by whatever means may be necessary, as a
                            counterpart to our support of the Nationalists. The project which we
                            seem to have abandoned, would, if taken firmly in hand, have gone far
                            toward creating an anti-Communist movement among Chinese where no such
                            movement now exists.</p>
                        <p>The recent increase in Chinese Communist activities in Southeast Asia in
                            general and the Philippines in particular is a matter of grave concern
                            to me. The local governments in this area have little or no capabilities
                            to prevent the build up of large, effective Communist undergrounds among
                            their Chinese populations. These Chinese, given the pattern of their
                            political relationships with the governments under which they live,
                            neither will nor can resist this Communist effort by themselves. They
                            will only do so on receipt of help, advice and direction from us. While
                            the Communist effort in this field is a large one, it lies well within
                            our capabilities to make a comparable, successful counter effort.
                            Indeed, it is incumbent on us to do so, unless we are willing to see the
                            Chinese of Southeast Asia mobilized as a Communist fifth column.</p>
                        <p>I would conclude by saying again that there is nothing in the Third Force
                            idea that detracts in the least from Taiwan’s potentiality. It would
                            doubtless detract from the prestige and self esteem of Chiang and his
                            principal followers, but these are scarcely to be reckoned as factors
                            contributing anything toward the American position, or even the total
                            anti-Communist position, in Asia. I hope that as our Asiatic policy
                            develops in the near future, it will accommodate as an integral part the
                            Third Force idea and that we will have some share here in the
                            implementation of that idea.</p>

                        <p>There are enclosed herewith copies of a letter of July 31, 1951, <pb
                                n="1773" xml:id="pg_1773" facs="0315"/>addressed by the American
                            Chargé d’Affaires to the Chinese Foreign Minister, and the latter’s

                                Yeh’s reply, not printed, stated that the calling up of 3,000 of the
                                original 15,000 men was to be indefinitely postponed and that 4,568

                                be released and placed on reserve status.</note> regarding the
                            call-up of 15,000 men for the Chinese Armed Services which was announced
                            July 25. The two letters are self-explanatory, but further details may
                            be obtained from the references listed above.</p>
                        <p>The action of the Chinese Government in announcing the conscription of
                            15,000 additional men was perhaps not in itself a matter warranting
                            official American opposition. It is understood that the Armed Forces
                            would still have been somewhat under the strength authorized when the
                            1951 budget was adopted. However, the particularly critical financial
                            position at the present moment, the fact that the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had not been consulted, and the delay
                            in replying to the Embassy’s communication of July 20, 1951,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d164fn3">See telegram 42 to Taipei, July 13, 1951, <ref
                                    target="#pg_1750">p. 1750</ref>.</note> on the control of
                            expenditures, all suggested the wisdom of making something of an issue
                            of the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese military authorities are not accustomed to being crossed, and
                            at first were adamant in insisting that the call-up should go through as
                            planned. The Generalissimo is reported to have sided with them for a
                            time at least. The Charge’s letter to the Foreign Minister was intended
                            to make the matter very clear but not an open issue. It was reinforced
                            by verbal representations in various quarters. The fact that the Chinese
                            military finally climbed half-way down from their earlier position is
                            sufficient evidence that they were impressed with American insistence,
                            however tactfully applied.</p>
                        <p>To date the entire affair has been kept out of the press, so that no
                            serious loss of face is involved. It is hoped that the result will have
                            a salutary effect in the proper quarters.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: Confirming our
                                conversation of last evening I hope you can make clear to your
                                colleagues in the Government that we take a very serious view of the
                                circumstances under which 15,000 recruits are scheduled to be called
                                up for service in the Armed Forces.</p>
                            <p>In the first place, a response to my memorandum (No. 8) of July 20 is
                                still being awaited. As you recall, that memorandum requested the
                                    <pb n="1774" xml:id="pg_1774" facs="0316"/>Government of China,
                                as a matter of urgency, to formulate procedures designed to bring
                                its military and civilian expenditures under planned control. This
                                was done upon specific instructions from the Department of State,
                                and the importance we attached to the subject was evidenced by the
                                fact that Dr. Moyer, General Chase and I discussed it at a special
                                conference with the Generalissimo on the same day you received my
                                memorandum.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, you are familiar with the extraordinary efforts being made
                                by the economic branches of your Government, in close cooperation
                                with <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, to close the serious
                                budgetary gap which now threatens the entire financial structure of
                                this island. It was with this situation in mind that General Chase
                                has reiterated to the Chief of Staff, General Chou Chili-jou, his
                                opposition to any addition of recruits to the Armed Forces.</p>
                            <p>Under the circumstances we see no justification for the action of the
                                Ministry of National Defense in calling up these recruits, at a
                                substantial cost to the Government, without full prior consultation
                                with the American officials most immediately concerned and against
                                their known opposition in principle, as well as without the approval
                                of the Economic Stabilization Board. If such action is permitted,
                                then the operations of the Board and the efforts of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> experts to assist in budget and tax
                                improvements become largely meaningless. This will be only too
                                apparent to our Government in Washington.</p>
                            <p>I see no alternative, therefore, to asking you to persuade the
                                Executive Yuan to defer indefinitely the implementation of this
                                order calling up recruits. I would ask also that a reply to my
                                memorandum of July 20 be expedited in order to establish procedures
                                as soon as possible which would prevent a recurrence of such
                                developments as that under immediate discussion.</p>
                            <p>I have written to you in the form of a personal letter, in the hope
                                that this question can be solved discreetly. However, I would ask
                                you to leave no doubt in the minds of your colleagues of the
                                seriousness with which we regard this matter.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <p>I appreciate reasoning behind our previous practice of sending unsigned

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dean</hi>: Nearly five months have gone by
                            since I saw you in Washington<note n="1" xml:id="d168fn1">Rankin had
                                visited Washington for consultations in late February and early
                                March 1951.</note> and it may be time for an informal review of the
                            past as well as a look ahead.</p>
                        <p>I recall that one of the points you emphasized was the importance of the
                            Chinese keeping out of American politics. Both before and since that
                            time I have worked on this problem; at least a number of the leading
                            Chinese here can no longer be in doubt as to how we stand on this point
                            and where their own best interest lies. In actual fact, I am fairly well
                            persuaded that nothing of consequence is now being done in this field
                            except by persons over whom the Chinese Government has little or no
                            control. The latter include various Americans in and out of public life
                            as well as certain unofficial Chinese residing in the United States.
                            Such material as we have unearthed at this end has been reported to the
                            Department (see, for example, mytel 1717 of June 17, which also referred
                            to previous communications; also our <pb n="1779" xml:id="pg_1779"

                                xml:id="d168fn2">None printed.</note> respectively). In the absence
                            of comments from the Department I am unable to determine how any or all
                            of this may complement information available in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Incidentally, one of my earlier efforts to discourage the Chinese from a
                            partisan demonstration seems to have backfired, but I hope without doing
                            any harm. I refer to my confidential despatch 84 of November 27, 1950,
                            on Senator Knowland’s visit to Formosa, which the Department supplied to
                            the Senate Committee during the MacArthur hearings.<note n="3"

                        </p>
                        <p>A second point which you brought up was that the Nationalists should do a
                            better job of winning the support of overseas Chinese in various parts
                            of the world. This subject naturally has had some attention from all of
                            us right along, but I asked Rinden<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">Robert W.
                                Rinden, Second Secretary at the Embassy in Taipei.</note> to review
                            it in a comprehensive despatch. The result is No. 330 of June 21,
                                1951,<note n="5" xml:id="d168fn5">Not printed.</note> which seems to
                            me a very workmanlike job; it is entitled “Overseas Chinese and
                            Nationalist China”. Foreign Minister Yeh, who is specifically
                            responsible for cultivating relations with the overseas Chinese, has
                            discussed the matter with me on numerous occasions. He and others seem
                            to be making a genuine effort, and I believe that this effort should be
                            continued. Frankly, however, I do not expect much to be accomplished of
                            a tangible nature except as this island takes on more and more of the
                            appearance of a band wagon as a result of our military and economic aid.
                            Promoting trips to Formosa, inviting individuals of some prominence to
                            come here and take official positions, and exchanging basketball teams
                            and bands may be about as far as we can expect the Chinese Government to
                            go for the time being. Yeh tells me that they are particularly avoiding
                            the solicitation of financial assistance from the overseas Chinese
                            living in various parts of Asia; they fear that such action would scare
                            many of them off at the present time. On the other hand, they would
                            welcome suggestions from us as to how they might collect taxes from
                            Chinese residing in the United States.</p>
                        <p>I agree that we should not put all of our eggs in the Formosa basket, but
                            I still feel that we should not expect very much from any “Third Force”
                            in China. If I recall correctly, this term was first used in France. At
                            any rate, for a number of years we have been looking around in various
                            countries for nice, clean, honest, “democratic”, middle-of-the-road
                            groups to which we could give our support. We have at least something
                            substantial to work with in Western Europe, although even there our
                            search has not been notably successful. <pb n="1780" xml:id="pg_1780"
                                facs="0322"/>One basic difficulty is that where Communism is an
                            immediate and serious threat there seems to be no place for
                            middle-of-the-roaders. People have to choose one side or the other;
                            neutrality becomes an anachronism.</p>
                        <p>The so-called Third Force in Hong Kong seems to have neither
                            organization, program nor money, except for what financial support some
                            of our people may be giving them. The relatively large committee set up
                            in an effort to coordinate matters has proved unwieldy and could
                            scarcely have been expected to unite such disparate and even mutually
                            hostile elements. In any case, the British seem to be putting on the
                            heat, with the result that our most prominent worthies reportedly are
                            moving to Manila. (The British also have clamped down on various
                            Nationalist operations in Hong Kong to date; eight of the leaders are
                            said to be in jail). Just what we are doing in Singapore, Bangkok and
                            elsewhere I do not know, but I have been somewhat disturbed by vague
                            rumors that we are reviving Wang Ching-wei<note n="6" xml:id="d168fn6"

                            remnants in Japan for Third Force purposes. I assume, however, that all
                            of this is being coordinated somewhere along the line.</p>
                        <p>The encouragement of any and all anti-Communist elements is justified up
                            to a point where the law of diminishing returns begins to operate. It is
                            not a bad idea at all to keep the Nationalists and the others on their
                            toes by giving appropriate support to all of them, but when they begin
                            to feel that we intend to play them against each other in any important
                            respect, we shall begin to lose not only their confidence but their
                            cooperation. We are already noticing that here to some degree.</p>
                        <p>The third point you made was, as I recall, that the Chinese Government
                            must put its economic house in order. In this field they have done
                            rather well during the past year. Ray Moyer will have discussed this
                            with you in Washington, but I might refer to a recent <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> telegram from Taipei (No. 701, July
                                26),<note n="7" xml:id="d168fn7">Not printed.</note> which
                            summarizes the situation and a considerable part of which I drafted
                            myself. The essential considerations are that little more can be done in
                            the way of raising revenues or reducing expenditures, and that if we are
                            going to do a job here it will cost a lot of money. Assuming that all of
                            our best efforts are exerted, the more funds we have, within reason, the
                            better job we can do. And $50 million additional now may be worth $100
                            million more a year or two hence.</p>
                        <p>Seen from Washington, as a comparatively minor part of a global problem,
                            our insistence on the need for more economic aid for Formosa may seem
                            exaggerated. I assure you that it is not. Our present military-economic
                                <pb n="1781" xml:id="pg_1781" facs="0323"/>program for this island
                            is considerably larger than that for which $350 million was spent in
                            Greece during the first year of the Truman Doctrine when world prices
                            were appreciably lower. The size of the civil population is about the
                            same in each case, but the military establishment on Formosa today is
                            nearly three times as large as that of Greece in 1947–48. I would be
                            willing to settle for a smaller military program here in <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>52 if the savings could be diverted to
                            economic support (see mytel 1458 of April 20): the latter is more
                            urgent.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> Formosa would
                            require outside economic assistance for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss>52 of approximately $75 million to keep the economy
                            afloat, assuming no further drafts on the modest gold reserves still
                            held by the Central Bank. I understand that we now propose to allocate
                            military “hardware” valued at $217 million in the current year. Our best
                            estimate here is that $75 million should be added to the total for
                            purely military items to cover additional imports (<gloss
                                target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>, etc.) for military purposes and to
                            prevent monetary inflation as a result of increased local currency
                            expenditures incidental to the military program. To make a $217 million
                            military hardware program fully effective, therefore, we should have
                            approximately $150 million additional for all other categories of aid.
                            Yet $90 million is all that Congress was asked for, and even this figure
                            may be reduced.</p>
                        <p>It is true that <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> allocated a
                            substantial sum to Formosa toward the end of <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss>51 which will be reflected in commodity imports during
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>52. However, there will be a
                            partially offsetting carry-over into <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                            >FY</gloss>53. The <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> Mission tells me
                            that, assuming the $90 million allocation is adhered to, Formosa will
                            have, in effect, about $38 million less than they requested for <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>52. This figure is only 12 percent of what
                            we propose to spend in any case, but it may well represent the
                            difference between a balanced, full scale operation, and one involving
                            severe limitations.</p>
                        <p>The possibility of modifying our military program in the light of
                            matériel availabilities and the amount of economic aid authorized
                            should, it seems to me, be looked into immediately. Whatever the sum
                            made available for strictly military purposes in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss>52, it presumably would be fully obligated during the
                            year. It is more than likely, however, that many of the military items
                            so ordered could not be delivered until <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss>53 or even 54. This is particularly true of artillery,
                            tanks and communications equipment. American productive capacity for all
                            such critical items doubtless will be used to the full in any case, and
                            there would seem to be obvious advantages in not allotting them to
                            individual foreign countries so far in advance. The situation a year or
                            more hence may be quite different from that today. In any <pb n="1782"
                                xml:id="pg_1782" facs="0324"/>event, a substantially smaller sum
                            than $217 million, plus the carryover of $71 million from <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>51, should cover everything that Formosa
                            could expect actually to receive in the way of matériel during the next
                            12 months and still provide a normal carry-over into <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>53. Such savings would have no practical
                            effect on our <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>52 military program and
                            might be used to justify the larger economic aid without which both
                            programs may be seriously curtailed. I hope that flexibility of this
                            order will be maintained in the interest of optimum results.</p>
                        <p>There is also the more fundamental question of the standards to be
                            followed in arming “underdeveloped” countries. This is in large part a
                            technical military matter, but it is one that deserves the best thought
                            of all of us if we are to get the most out of our resources. Of course,
                            we are not going to provide battleships or super-bombers to such
                            countries as China, Thailand, Iran or even to Turkey, Greece or
                            Yugoslavia. But lines should be drawn very much lower than this.
                            Whenever I see Chinese soldiers riding about in American trucks, I think
                            we would do better to provide them with good shoes and more proteins in
                            their rations. When I see tanks go by—or stand in junk yards—it makes me
                            wonder what will happen to the new and highly complicated Pattons which
                            we have planned to furnish them at a cost to the taxpayers of $240,000
                            each. Moreover, by the time the Chinese are ready to maintain and
                            operate such weapons properly, the Patton may well be obsolete.</p>
                        <p>It seems all too evident that for countries where there is plenty of
                            manpower, but a shortage of technical skill and manufacturing
                            facilities, we should provide as a matter of policy the simplest
                            possible arms. I am thinking of light automatic weapons, bazookas,
                            mortars, rockets, recoilless rifles, hand grenades, mines, etc. Often
                            these, and any needed ammunition, can also be manufactured by simple
                            methods in such places as Formosa. Going a step higher, it may be
                            questioned seriously whether any countries outside Western Europe
                            (probably excluding Japan also for the visible future but for different
                            reasons) should be furnished with aircraft larger than fighter-bombers,
                            or artillery above 105 mm, or naval vessels for other than patrol needs.
                            If we go appreciably beyond such standards we shall not only be spending
                            excessive sums at the outset but also burdening these countries with
                            equipment which they can never afford to maintain or renew with their
                            own resources.</p>
                        <p>In summary, it seems to me that our underdeveloped friends should be
                            armed primarily for defense. If this is well done, further Communist
                            aggression will be discouraged and we shall also have useful allies in
                            case of trouble. We, with some help from Western Europe, <pb n="1783"
                                xml:id="pg_1783" facs="0325"/>would be compelled in any case to
                            provide the highly modern striking forces of bombers, carriers,
                            submarines, tanks, etc., without which victory could not be ours in a
                            large conflict.</p>
                        <p>Along these lines I believe that we could make out very well with a
                            substantial reduction in military expenditures for Formosa. However,
                            this would not permit of a proportionate decrease in economic and
                            quasi-military outlays. The chief explanation is that many
                            quasi-military expenditures are essential features of the first year
                            during which <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> will operate. As a
                            rough estimate, the additional $38 million mentioned above would also be
                            a measure of the non-recurring expenditures incidental to inaugurating
                            the military aid program, including additions and repairs to docks,
                            airfields, roads, warehouses, etc. Most of this should not be postponed.
                            We are already very late and such construction work takes time.</p>
                        <p>Any way we look at it there is a great deal of money involved, and the
                            end is not in sight. I believe, therefore, that we should project our
                            thinking well beyond the current fiscal year. Of course, a general
                            conflict might break out at any time, in which case we should have to
                            revise much of our planning in Formosa and elsewhere. But I take it that
                            our policy is to prevent such an outbreak if at all possible and, by
                            implication, to preserve more or less the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi> in anti-Communist countries around the Curtain. I take it
                            also that we expect to succeed in carrying out this policy. If so, we
                            should be looking ahead five or even 10 years in Formosa. We should then
                            come face to face with basic problems which we have tended to avoid
                            because of their medium to long-term character. Among these problems are
                            the future of the Chinese military establishment on this island, the
                            reorientation of export and import trade, and a related shift in
                            agricultural and industrial production.</p>
                        <p>Without going into great detail in this letter, I believe that we should
                            undertake studies to determine how much the armed forces could be
                            reduced over a period of years while maintaining or actually increasing
                            their total combat effectiveness. Other export commodities probably
                            should be developed to replace sugar, which now accounts for 80 percent
                            of Formosa’s export trade and yet apparently cannot be produced
                            economically under local climatic conditions. Domestic production of
                            certain essential items, notably chemical fertilizer, should be expanded
                            and imports reduced accordingly. This short list will illustrate what
                            should be done if Formosa is to enjoy increasing stability and the
                            burden on the American taxpayer gradually reduced.</p>
                        <p>I believe, too, that when we take a longer range viewpoint the political
                            situation falls into better perspective. Whatever the shortcomings of
                            the regime on Formosa, it is evolving and, on balance, improving. <pb
                                n="1784" xml:id="pg_1784" facs="0326"/>Certainly it differs
                            enormously, both in theory and practice, from the Communist strait
                            jacket which holds the Mainland. And individuals do not live forever!
                            Now that the United States is again taking a decisive part in supporting
                            Free China’s economy and its armed forces, we can use these channels to
                            influence other developments. China has the oldest civil service system
                            in the world but it needs to be modernized. Governor Wu would welcome
                            American help in this field, particularly in devising methods of job
                            analysis which would gradually weed out unnecessary employees.
                            Paralleling this, better systems of pay and promotion should be
                            introduced in both civil and military services as a prerequisite to
                            eliminating squeeze and promoting general efficiency. There will always
                            be squeeze in any country where government employees cannot live on
                            their pay! Budgetary, accounting and tax procedures also need attention
                            and are already receiving it from <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                            specialists who have recently arrived.</p>
                        <p>In summary, I believe that we could well adopt a simple formula for our
                            effort here: improve efficiency while retaining enough individual
                            liberty so that a genuine Chinese democracy can evolve.</p>
                        <p>In the process of looking ahead it is also important to keep our thinking
                            clear on the fundamental problem of overpopulation in so much of the Far
                            East. The Communists have promised higher living standards without
                            caring whether these promises could be kept. Americans have tended to
                            outbid them in this regard, with the best of intentions but without
                            realizing the full implications of such promises. During the current
                            fiscal year we are by way of assuming at least a degree of
                            responsibility for the economic welfare of nearly 700 million people in
                            Asia and its nearby islands. For this program we propose to spend an
                            average of about 54 cents a head. A great deal of good can be done with
                            this money, but no one can pretend that it will produce any discernible
                            rise in general living standards. As a matter of fact, we shall be doing
                            very well indeed if we can prevent present standards from declining in
                            the face of fears and dislocations caused by the Communist menace.</p>
                        <p>Of course we can and should push on with our programs of technical
                            assistance and of direct economic aid to meet emergency conditions. But
                            we know that improvements in the fields of agriculture and public health
                            will be offset by a net increase in population as regards any general
                            effect on living standards in most of Asia, including Formosa. Only when
                            such efforts are complemented by wide scale industrialization and birth
                            control will the economic lot of the common man in Asia begin to
                            improve. This is not only a very long term conception, transcending any
                            aid program we have ever envisaged, but it also involves fundamental
                            questions of economic security. Elimination of colonialism also did away
                            very largely with sound currencies, reasonable credit facilities and a
                            conception of property rights essential <pb n="1785" xml:id="pg_1785"
                                facs="0327"/>to private enterprise. However much the colonial powers
                            may have profited in the past, a very large number of Asiatics benefited
                            economically from colonial rule. Now all of them are being thrown back
                            upon the oldest of all forms of economic security: breeding the largest
                            possible number of children. The Communists could not have ordered
                            matters better toward the attainment of their ends.</p>
                        <p>We are feeling all of this here in Formosa. The population is increasing
                            rapidly from an excess of births over deaths. Due to this fact, and to
                            the much more rigorous collection of taxes from the largely agricultural
                            population, some of our best American experts have become convinced that
                            the average inhabitant of this island is worse off economically than he
                            was a year or two ago. Yet during this period there have been very real
                            improvements in agricultural production and in marketing methods,
                            largely as a result of the assistance of <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> and its affiliated <gloss target="#t_JCRR1"
                                >JCRR</gloss>. Now we are complicating this problem enormously,
                            although quite properly, by a large scale program of military aid. It is
                            none too soon to undertake a careful study as to where all of this is
                            leading us. Such a project is worthy of the attention of two or three of
                            the best men the Department and <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> can
                            find. Several months probably would be required to complete such a
                            study, during which time those participating should be free from any
                            operational or administrative responsibilities. Their findings might
                            well provide not only a blueprint for the future of Formosa but also a
                            useful guide in developing our Mutual Security Program for other
                            countries of Asia and the Pacific area.<note n="8" xml:id="d168fn8">Rusk

                                which dealt primarily with the question of how U.S. forces on

                        <p>613. Ref Contel 114, rptd New Delhi 110, Aug 13 from Calcutta. Emb
                            appreciates opportunity which exists in possible transmittal letter on
                            US letterhead signed by Amer official to Tib Defense Min … for purpose
                            persuading Tib officials to disavow Sino-Tib agreement and to advise
                                <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> to leave Tibet.</p>
                        <p>Emb believes, however, risks involved in transmittal proposed letter are
                            far greater than advantages which may result for US and Tibet.</p>
                        <p>If such document fell into Commie Chi hands, it might be used as evidence
                            US endeavor imperialistically to interfere in internal affairs of Tibet
                            and to disrupt ostensibly friendly relations between China and Tibet. It
                            might even be possible, if Tibs were hard pressed in further negots with
                            Commie Chi, that Tibs might use such document to reinforce their
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Emb questions, in any event, whether additional communication from US,
                            even on US letterhead and signed by Amer official, would increase Tib
                            knowledge and belief in US position. As Dept and ConGen aware, all
                            previous msgs re US position were transmitted to <gloss target="#t_DL1"
                                >DL</gloss> through two and in some cases three channels of
                            communications. These channels included Shakabpa, Taktse and Harrer.
                            Important Tib officials surrounding <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss>
                            were probably informed substance these msgs in transmission to <gloss
                                target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> by <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> fol
                            receipt. Harrer has informed Emb <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> sent
                            him two ltrs in which <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> acknowledged
                            receipt all US communications and indicated that he himself would have
                            preferred to <pb n="1787" xml:id="pg_1787" facs="0329"/>leave Tibet but
                            decided return Lhasa in accordance with “wishes and opinion of the
                            majority of Tibet”.</p>
                        <p>On balance, therefore, Emb believes <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> and
                            Tib officials are well informed re US position and that proposed letter
                            to Tib Defense Min would not sufficiently add to such knowledge to
                            justify risks involved. Furthermore, Dept msg quoted in <gloss

                            sent. In such message Emb believes it might be helpful to suggest that
                                <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> send personal rep in whom he and
                            Tib officials had confidence to India for informal discussion with Amer
                            officials. Such rep would be able return Tib and make report which would
                            confirm substance US position and wld be more likely serve as basis for
                            such further actions as <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> prepared to
                            take. In addition, Taktse might write <gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss>
                            at that time observing that Taktse’s own ltrs may not be reaching him
                            and recommending rep be sent India for informal discussion with Amer
                            officials re possible future courses of action.</p>
                        <p>Suggestions advanced in foregoing para are based on belief Tibs in Lhasa
                            will continue to “stall” in their negots with Commie Chi and have merit
                            of avoiding dispatch official US documents to Tibet where they may reach

                        <p>650. ConGen contacts on Kwangtung principally Catholic priests coming out
                            and persons with guerrilla connections give picture of diminishing overt
                            resistance there. Guerrillas for most part said to be lying low as
                            action bring prompt and heavy retaliation. At same time there is
                            evidence Commies having increasing difficulty with disaffection and

                        <p>Info hangs on Kwangsi report guerrillas there under heavy pressure.
                            Recent arrival from west Kwangsi told ConGen informant that guerrillas
                            that area split by current Commie suppression drive into three separate
                            groups and short both food and ammunition. South Kwangsi guerrilla
                            leader who arrived month ago told ConGen his small force just able
                            maintain self in mountains but not expand. Others in frequent touch with
                            new arrivals from Kwangsi pessimistic regarding guerrillas future.
                            Former Governor of Kwangsi Huang Hsu-chu quoted by reliable source as
                            saying it is folly to plan in terms of guerrillas at this stage. While
                            not all observers as discouraged as Huang opinion more and more gen that
                            only direct, continuous Amer aid can enable guerrillas to survive as
                            active anti-Commie force. Generally agreed upon fact that main railways
                            and highways of Kwangsi now practically free of guerrilla interference
                            is clear indication of latter’s diminishing influence. While they have
                            by no means been reduced to few thousand as recently claimed in Commie
                            propaganda their numbers and activity certainly not increasing in
                            Kwangsi.</p>
                        <p>In contrast above picture Hong Kong press past several months has carried
                            large number accounts of alleged sabotage by guerrillas, shooting of
                            Commie cadres and defection military units particularly in Kwangtung and
                            Kwangsi. Nearly all such stories impossible verify and ConGen has
                            maintained skeptical attitude particularly toward those in strongly

                            rather sensational reports have more than once proved without
                            foundation. However, Hong Kong polit advisor who has also been skeptical
                            of such reports, is swinging to view that there is some foundation for
                            belief that there has been flare-up of anti-Commie activity at least in
                            Kwangtung. He told ConGen that Brit observation posts confirmed that
                            large explosion took place Shumchun on August 3 and that press reported
                            guerrillas threw grenades into military depot there and destroyed
                            several hundred drums kerosene, tires and other items.</p>
                        <p>ConGen still disinclined to believe anti-Commie elements these two
                            provinces becoming more active. Undoubtedly many incidents of sabotage
                            and opposition occur particularly in areas where Commie land program
                            being put into effect but such incidents are not indicative of
                            improvement in guerrilla supply, organization or numbers. Reports <pb
                                n="1789" xml:id="pg_1789" facs="0331"/>of friction between local
                            Commies and northerners and of Commie anxiety over possible Nationalist
                            invasion are encouraging but have hardly reached stage where they wld
                            lead to frequent defection to guerrillas. Those whom ConGen considers
                            most competent to judge feel that guerrillas fighting losing battle.
                            Unless they receive effective outside aid they will be reduced by end
                            year to small scattered pockets which may be able to survive but can
                            hardly represent more than irritant to Commies. By this time completion
                            of Commie land program will have established polit controls in
                            countryside similar to those of north Chi which wld make it much more
                            difficult for resistance groups to operate.</p>

                            single countries. Since latter approach evidently considered tactically
                            desirable by <pb n="1792" xml:id="pg_1792" facs="0334"/>Brit and others,
                            it becomes necessary this Govt exploit all possibilities individual
                            approaches. Dept must have as much concrete evidence as possible that
                            steps in behalf Amers in particular being taken. This means Dept must
                            not only be generally satisfied definite efforts being made by
                            representing powers, but that it also have evidence to which it can
                            point when interested parties, who have legitimate reason for deep
                            anxiety, inquire re action being taken. This applies to evidence that
                            any principal power has declined assist.</p>
                        <p>Swiss apparently not mentioning Amers. Roschin apparently did not do so
                            and Dept unaware whether Panikkar did. We believe representation shld
                            mention situation Amers (without necessity naming individual cases) in

                        <p>General Yu, who has just returned from Formosa to take charge at the
                            Chinese Embassy of all American aid matters, called on me <pb n="1794"
                                xml:id="pg_1794" facs="0336"/>today at his request. After the usual
                            exchange of greetings and the amenities, I told the General that I was
                            delighted that he had accepted this position and that I wanted to assure
                            him the complete cooperation of the Department and this Bureau in
                            assisting him in any feasible way. I went on to say that I wished to
                            talk frankly to him as an old friend on the general subject of our aid.
                            I said that he was no doubt familiar with the <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> which our Chargé had delivered to the Gimo on the
                            subject of effective supervision. General Yu said that he was completely
                            familiar with this and also with the Chinese reply. I said that the
                            latter we accepted as an expression of the desire of the National
                            Government to cooperate fully with our Embassy, our <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> Mission. I said that the general order of our combined
                            programs requested for fiscal 1952 was in the neighborhood of $300
                            million, that this on a per capita basis was the equivalent of between
                            $12 and $15 billion for the mainland and must be by far the largest
                            program of aid on a per capita basis to any country in the world. I said
                            that we were totally serious in our intent to see that every penny was
                            properly and effectively used and that we looked to his Government for
                            complete and full cooperation in this regard. I told him that his
                            Government had many sincere friends in Congress and our Government but
                            it also had many individuals who were aware that our aid in the past had
                            not always been effectively used and that we had a duty to our taxpayers
                            who were assuming so heavy a burden for the entire free world to see
                            that our contributions were not misused. General Yu expressed himself as
                            being in complete agreement and said that he would use all his influence
                            with his Government to assure effective cooperation between us on
                            Formosa.</p>

                            seems likely Tib officials will shortly engage in further talks with
                            Commie-Chi officials on subj Sino-Tib agreement. While many Tib

                            Commie-Chi control in Tib, Emb inclined believe they will continue
                            temporize in their dealings with Commie-Chi in hope developments in
                            Korea will make it difficult for Commie-Chi implement such provisions

                                are at this time more than 20 Amer cits imprisoned in China, the
                                majority of whom have been under arrest for 6 months or more. One
                                has died in prison and several are believed to be in great physical
                                or econ distress. There are approx 30 Amer natls under what is known
                                as ‘house arrest’. A nr of others have for a varying period of 2
                                years or more been consistently refused permission to leave China, a
                                condition which is tantamount to forced detention. Of the persons

                            Sept 4. Before doing so I read message to him and orally informed him of
                            contents of second and third to last paras of <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Vishinsky remarked that message had not been sent to most important
                            addressee, Commie Chi, I replied that we had no dipl relations with
                            them, as he knew. He made interesting remark that it was not necessary
                            have dipl relations in order exchange direct message from one govt to
                            another. Continuing, he said this was a matter concerning internal
                            affairs in Chi and, of course, Sov Govt cld not intervene. I said that
                            many factors were involved in establishment dipl relations <pb n="1799"
                                xml:id="pg_1799" facs="0341"/>and that among other reasons ITS had
                            been unable extend recognition Commie Chi because of its failure fulfill
                            internatl obligations. Vishinsky stated he held another view. He
                            considered that laws for treatment of offenders were domestic concern of
                            each country and expressed belief that those under arrest in Chi were
                            being given justice and said that their Amer nationality did not warrant
                            their going unpunished. I reiterated that treatment of this kind
                            accorded Amer natls was one of reasons why US cld not establish dipl
                            relations with Commie Chi. He said that he did not presume to recommend
                            recognition or interfere into a matter of concern only to two govts
                            involved but he said he did not believe that our contention about this
                            treatment was the reason for not recognizing Commie Chi but only that
                            the US Govt preferred not to recognize the lawful govt that truly
                            represented the 500 million population of Chi, but rather to recognize
                            Chiang Kai-Shek whose regime had been driven out by the Chi people. He
                            said that if it were not for the presence of the Amer 7th Fleet, that
                            regime wld be disposed of within an hour. He said, however, that he did
                            not wish to continue this discussion. Our message wld be read and
                            considered and an answer given to it.</p>
                        <p>I said that the US position on these matters was well known thru
                            statements of the Pres and Secy Acheson (whereupon he interjected the
                            remark, in Russian, “only too well”), and that I had nothing more to
                            add. Then I asked if I were to consider he had given me a definitive
                            reply that his govt did not intend to act in this matter, or whether I
                            shld hear again from him. He said his own views had already been
                            expressed but that, as usual, his govt’s views did not depend on
                            him.</p>

                            behalf Americans in China:</p>
                        <p>Sept 18: Foreign diplomatic representatives not happy about
                            representations re US nationals, regarding which they seem to have
                            received divergent instructions from their govts. Panikkar, who
                            genuinely anxious to help, considers joint or concerted <hi
                                rend="italic">démarche</hi>, particularly if directed solely on
                            behalf US nationals, would defeat its own object and might prejudice
                            representations which Swiss, Indian and Brit representatives have
                            already made on a broader basis. Moreover such a <hi rend="italic"
                                >démarche</hi> wld only embarrass representatives of Indonesia,
                            Burma and smaller European nations. Present moment most inopportune for
                            such a gesture, in view unfavorable reaction in Peiping to San Francisco
                            conference and Kaesong talks.</p>
                        <p>Sept 18: Lamb believes above described reactions not unreasonable, but
                            Indian, Swiss and Brit representatives all agreed some action should be
                            taken. Indian and Swiss representatives consulting their govts. Swedish
                            Amb has already discussed question informally with vice <gloss
                                target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> at a recent dinner party.
                            Panikkar fearful lest ultimate US objective is use any joint
                            representations as subject for political propaganda. He convinced
                            injudicious publicity wld undermine value of representations already
                            made and wld prejudice his own position. Swiss representative shares
                            this view. Nevertheless they anxious to help and are considering joint
                            approach to Raschin (who has just returned from Moscow) and say various
                            members of diplomatic body instructed make representations on behalf US
                            nationals. Easchin wld be urged act in a collective representative
                            capacity as <hi rend="italic">doyen</hi> of diplomatic body.</p>
                        <p>Sept 19: Indian and Swiss representatives approached Raschin <pb n="1809"
                                xml:id="pg_1809" facs="0351"/>on afternoon 18th stating they “felt
                            it their duty bring facts to notice of <gloss target="#t_CPG1"
                                >CPG</gloss>, not only in interests of foreign communities but of
                                <gloss target="#t_CPG1">CPG</gloss> reputation abroad, by explaining
                            actions and conditions capable of creating misunderstandings”. If
                            several representatives individually made representations on same
                            subject <gloss target="#t_CPG1">CPG</gloss> might become resentful and
                            it seemed infinitely better for one or two speak on behalf of majority,
                            for which purpose Raschin as <hi rend="italic">doyen</hi> was most
                            logical person. Raschin expressed sympathy with above views and
                            volunteered statement he faced similar difficulties in arrests Soviet
                            nationals about whom his representations often remained unanswered for
                            as long as three months. He deprecated delay re travel permits. Re
                            practice holding individuals responsible for liabilities their
                            employers, this unfortunately is in consonance with Chinese legal
                            concepts. Raschin readily agreed speak to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1"
                                >PriMin</gloss> along suggested terms, adding he cld make approach
                            within next day or so. Raschin seemed to have taken decision entirely on
                            own initiative. No indication he was acting on instructions from Moscow
                            as he did not react when Indian and Swiss representatives mentioned
                            their understanding Soviet Govt had been approached by US. Raschin in
                            complete accord with necessity avoid publicity. Lamb fears this view may
                            be unwelcome to Dept but believes nothing shld be done to prejudice
                            positions “these invaluable representatives” (i.e. Swiss, Indian and
                            Soviet) or hazard effectiveness past or future intervention by them. He
                            warns that even if representations are effective results will not begin
                            to be visible for some time afterward. Dept, he feels, must not be
                            impatient.</p>
                        <p>After careful scrutiny above tels, <gloss target="#t_EmbOff1"
                                >EmbOff</gloss> discussed content at some length with Shattock, head
                            China-Korea Dept. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff1">EmbOff</gloss> expressed
                            personal satisfaction protection US interests China in hands of such a
                            capable and sympathetic official as Lamb. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff1"
                                >EmbOff</gloss> added, however, Panikkar entirely wrong in believing
                            Dept motivated by political considerations; on contrary, Dept solely
                            concerned with welfare US nationals in China and desire convince friends
                            and relatives in US everything that cld be done for them was in fact
                            being done. <gloss target="#t_EmbOff1">EmbOff</gloss> said he wld
                            recommend that no publicity be given to representations on behalf US
                            natls by members of diplomatic body in Peiping, or if this proved
                            impracticable that names of members involved not be revealed. He said he
                            wld also recommend that any publicity given be cleared in advance with
                            London and Delhi or, better, that Lamb himself be given opportunity to
                            comment. Shattock replied he appreciated and agreed with <gloss

                                >FonOff</gloss> re foreign natls in China.</p>
                        <p>Sept 22: Panikkar in conversation with Lamb quotes Raschin as saying he
                            proposes ask Chou’s permission talk to chief security police in hope of
                            inducing him accord to foreigners treatment consonant with western as
                            opposed to Chinese standards (this seems to Lamb to be an imaginative
                            and possibly constructive move). Raschin suggested that after he had
                            spoken to Chou, Panakkar might likewise do so. Panikkar hopes carry out
                            this suggestion before he returns to India early October. Panikkar also
                            considering whether he might recommend to Nehru that he send suitably
                            worded personal message to Chou through Chi Amb Delhi invoking Chou’s
                            sympathetic consideration plight foreigners in China. Lamb urged
                            Panikkar carry out his move and said there seemed to be merit in the
                            thought certain govts might communicate their concern through Chinese
                            diplomatic missions abroad, instead of or in addition to making
                            representations in Peiping, in view of notoriously evasive tactics of

                                xml:id="pg_1811" facs="0353"/>recognition policy in 1949 for the
                            Senator to examine. Subsequently, at Senator Smith’s request, the Far
                            Eastern Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee met on
                            September 28 in executive session with Deputy Assistant Secretary
                            Merchant, who reviewed United States policy on the question of
                            recognition and read a number of documents to the subcommittee. The
                            meeting was recorded in a memorandum of conversation by Philander P.
                            Claxton, September 28, 1951, not printed (790.00/10–951). The memorandum
                            of a conversation of October 8, 1951, between Rusk and F. S. Tomlinson
                            of the British Embassy, which touched on this subject, is included on
                                <ref target="frus1951v07p1#pg_1005">page 1005</ref>.</p>
                        <p>The hearings cited above, held between September 27 and October 18, 1951,
                            concerned the nomination of Ambassador at Large Philip C. Jessup to
                            represent the United States as a member of the United States Delegation
                            to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Much of the
                            discussion was related to United States China policy, particularly
                            United States policy in 1949 on the question of recognition and Jessup’s
                            role in formulating it.</p>

                        <p>Dept of course not in position to stipulate precise method of approach by
                            Missions concerned, however it feels obliged to ascertain whether powers
                            approached are giving concrete assistance; some have already taken
                            definite action. While representations might be joint, parallel, or
                            delegated to one power, the important thing in our eyes is that the
                            central Commie auths be clearly cognizant which powers are participants,
                            that representations be so couched as to call for Commies to take a
                            responsible position, and that representing power or powers report back
                            action taken. Move by Roschin wld be acceptable if it is concrete and

                            pointed to as the strongest dipl effort it cld make. We remain cognizant
                            of unique problem various powers have in maintaining relations with
                            Commie regime. However, we do not believe that merely the fear of
                            embarrassing or drawing anger from that regime shld deter fon powers
                            from extracting from it internatl responsibility which it claims and <pb

                            acknowledged by accepting relations with it.</p>
                        <p>This Govt has no intention use representations as subj for polit
                            propaganda, more particularly as such use might tend defeat serious aim

                            and not to justifiable measures taken by protecting powers. Dept
                            probably cannot avoid giving some publicity eventually to present

                                Chia-kan.</note> last evening we discussed your communication of
                            September 17 to General Chou<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">Not

                            general, the two ministers were in full agreement with your
                            recommendations. However, they raised the following points: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The new plan involves at least one important change which is a
                                    matter of high policy: the proposed transfer of authority over
                                    budgetary matters from the Chief of Staff to the Minister of
                                    National Defense (your paragraph 4). The ministers personally
                                    favored such action. However, they remarked that the Minister of
                                    National Defense<note n="3" xml:id="d201fn3">Kuo
                                        Chi-chiao.</note> himself preferred not to take a position
                                    in this matter, apparently to avoid creating the impression that
                                    he was seeking more power, and that a decision of a higher level
                                    than General Chou’s was required in any case. They queried me as
                                    to what General Chou’s reaction was to this proposal in his
                                    discussions with you. I replied that I did not know in detail
                                    but understood that he had raised no objection.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>A somewhat less significant change but nevertheless one of
                                    considerable importance organizationally is the proposal to
                                    divide the military establishment into about five groups for
                                    budgetary and accounting purposes (your paragraph 3), according
                                    to the two ministers. Again, they are inclined to favor your
                                    recommendation. It was pointed out, however, that this might
                                    bring up several old issues such as the status of the Combined
                                    Service Forces, created several years ago on American
                                    recommendation to support all other branches but in practice
                                    today serving only the Army. They remarked that the
                                    Generalissimo had long favored more or less parallel treatment
                                    for the Air Force and Navy, but that opposition from these
                                    services had prevented its realization. The ministers indicated
                                    that similar opposition to a system of combined budgetary
                                    control might be expected. However, they advanced these points
                                    by way of explanation and not because of any objection to the
                                    new plan on their part.</item>

                                <item>The ministers commented on the use of the word “supervise” in
                                    your paragraph 13<hi rend="italic">a</hi>. They remarked that
                                    the nearest Chinese equivalent is stronger than the English in
                                    meaning, and questioned <pb n="1815" xml:id="pg_1815"

                                    expression “advise in” might be substituted for “supervise”. I
                                    should appreciate having your opinion on this point.</item>

                                <item>The Finance Minister expressed the urgent hope that, whatever
                                    may be decided as to your recommendations, nothing should be
                                    permitted to delay actual work on the 1952 military
                                    budget.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>I gathered that the two ministers were fundamentally very much in favor
                            of your recommendations and are only concerned lest we should not be
                            willing to push them enough to overcome possible opposition among the
                            military. In this connection, I assured them that we felt strongly as to
                            the principles involved, although we were ready to discuss details so as
                            to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations in the simplest
                            and most expeditious manner possible.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that General Chou will not reply in writing to your
                            September 17 communication, in view of the considerations mentioned
                            above. After reading the present letter and discussing the points raised
                            with anyone who you think might have further ideas to contribute, I
                            suggest that we get together to consider whether a more formal
                            communication to the Chinese Government on the same subject may be in
                            order.</p>

                                >Barnett had been in Formosa in late August and early September on
                                an information-gathering mission.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>On October 1, I met with the Policy Planning Staff to discuss Formosa. My
                            own remarks on this subject ran to some 45 minutes. There followed a
                            question and answer period lasting about one and a half hours. I am
                            setting down for you—without making an effort to achieve literary polish
                            or to convert a speech into a scholarly treatise—a somewhat fattened
                            version of the outline from which I talked.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese made Formosa a laboratory experiment in their form of
                            colonialism. As such, it was highly successful and there exist
                            exhaustive facts and figures to document every phase of the Japanese
                            record. The Chinese were, during my stay in Formosa, completing a number
                            of studies of the Japanese archives, trying to draw lessons <pb n="1817"
                                xml:id="pg_1817" facs="0359"/>from them and, unavoidably,
                            experiencing some shame in the deterioration which has occurred in
                            Formosa since 1945.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese are very short of exact facts and figures. This was brought
                            to my attention, soon after my arrival, by the Formosa correspondent for
                            the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Daily News</hi> who asserted that the
                            population of Formosa is ten million or more and that the Chinese (and
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>) working estimate of eight
                            million is a political figure designed to help obfuscate the drain on
                            Formosan resources brought about by the Mainland military and civilian
                            refugee population. I got no support from any official source for that
                            ten million figure; officials, however, differ widely amongst themselves
                            in their guesses as to what the population of Formosa actually is. The
                            inexactness of statistics on population is characteristic of the
                            inexactness of statistics on almost all aspects of the economic,
                            military, and social situation on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>It is with considerable reserve, therefore, that one accepts as fact what
                            one reads and hears on Formosa. Nevertheless, I came away from Formosa
                            with several convictions based upon what I heard about psychological and
                            other imponderable factors at work on Formosa, as well as upon what I
                            heard, read, or could observe first hand about objective factors:</p>
                        <p>First, if the United States Seventh Fleet mission in the Formosa Straits
                            was terminated, the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> aid program cut
                            off, and the military training and equipment program of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> stopped, Formosa would be in the
                            hands of the Chinese Communists in possibly so short a time as six
                            months. …</p>
                        <p>Second, the strategic benefits to the United States of the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> operation on Formosa is apt to be far
                            more significant politically than militarily. In view of the magnitude
                            and depth of political and military developments on the China mainland,
                            it appears improbable that US military assistance to Formosa—almost
                            regardless of its volume—will create a Chinese military establishment
                            which, as a self-contained combat force, would be capable of either
                            defending itself against an all-out Chinese Communist attack or of
                            establishing a military bridgehead on the Mainland for secondary
                            operations which would result in detaching important parts of China from
                            the hegemony of Peking. Massive US tactical and logistical assistance
                            should be assumed to be necessary for the accomplishment of either of
                            these military objectives. In contrast to the limited expectations we
                            should have for the military effort, per se, the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> operation can bring about very
                            important political and economic results.</p>
                        <p>Third, I can see no long-term future for Formosa except as a part of
                            China—a China, this means, of which Formosa could be a part without such
                            a coalescence doing harm to US interest and objectives <pb n="1818"
                                xml:id="pg_1818" facs="0360"/>in Asia. This opinion is shared, I
                            believe, by the Chinese officials on Formosa who hold the “optimistic”
                            view that World War III will produce this result. In Hong Kong a
                            different view prevails. It is that World War III would bring such a
                            catastrophe to Asia as a whole that the Chinese in Hong Kong—who,
                            detesting the Communists, refuse to return to the Mainland, and feel
                            much the same about Formosa—would not much care what became of Formosa.
                            Their hope is that a formula can be worked out for the achievement of an
                            independent, stable, and secure Formosa which would accomodate itself to
                            its neighbors in the Far East, including Communist China. When they are
                            asked what they think would be Chiang Kai-shek’s attitude towards
                            Formosa were he in Peking and Mao Tse-tung installed in Taipei they
                            admit that Chiang would insist upon the recovery of the Island for
                            China. When pressed, therefore, they too find it difficult to envisage a
                            Formosa dissociated permanently from the China mainland, whether it be
                            under Communist or non-Communist control.</p>
                        <p>Fourth, I am convinced that it is clearly in the United States interest
                            to keep Formosa out of Chinese Communist control partly for what that
                            act of mercy means to the people on Formosa and partly for the value of
                            its ports and air fields to any possible future US military effort in
                            the Pacific, but, far more important, for what it can mean as a
                            disturbing and psychologically undermining factor for Russian-dominated
                            Communist Chinese authority on the Mainland. I believe, further, that we
                            should plan to deny Formosa to Communist China <hi rend="italic"
                                >primarily</hi> by projecting on a publicly announced and “permanent
                            basis” the present mission of the Seventh Fleet and by including in our
                            military plans for Okinawa and Japan the use of US forces there to cope
                            with possible Communist attack on Formosa based upon the China mainland.
                            As a short-term corollary for this longer-term commitment and plan, I
                            believe that we should give to General Chase and the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> all the assistance that they are able
                            to administer efficiently for 1952, <hi rend="italic">provided</hi>
                            Minister Rankin, General Chase, and Mr. Moyer are able to secure from
                            Chiang Kai-shek a commitment that <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            should exercise veto authority over the size and character of the budget
                            for the military establishment on Formosa and should exercise a similar
                            veto authority over all military expenditures, whether the resources
                            drawn upon are of Chinese or United States origin. The State Department,
                            the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>, and the Defense Department
                            should, in my opinion, give our representatives in Taipei the fullest
                            support, whether it be diplomatic, by the acceleration of movement of
                            hardware, by the provision of highly trained personnel for specific
                            tasks, by the adequate staffing of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            field operations, or otherwise, to achieve basic reforms in the military
                                <pb n="1819" xml:id="pg_1819" facs="0361"/>sector of Formosan
                            society. These reforms should be brought about on the working hypothesis
                            that there should be final Chinese civilian responsibility and authority
                            in the administration of good government and sound finances on Formosa.
                            This does not now exist. It is a prerequisite for the accomplishment of
                            our military, as well as all the other important objectives which we
                            seek on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>It is only through the leverage of military assistance, however, that
                            either the military or other economic and social reforms needed on
                            Formosa can be accomplished. If achieved, they can set free for
                            constructive effort the remarkably fertile and expert civilian talents
                            which exist there and which have the potential for providing Formosa
                            with better government than has existed in modern China.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>This cannot happen so long as the Generalissimo preserves the Chinese
                            military establishment as a personal garrison, supporting itself by
                            whatever arbitrary devices it can get away with in exploiting the human
                            and natural resources on Formosa. Minister Rankin, General Chase, and
                            Mr. Moyer have requested and obtained from Washington authority to work
                            out with the Generalissimo arrangements whereby the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> will exercise authority in preparing
                            jointly with the Ministry of National Defense all military budgets and
                            supervising all military expenditures, whether out of US aid or local
                            resources. The Generalissimo has not as yet agreed to such arrangements.
                            If he does, General Chase’s hand will be strengthened greatly in dealing
                            with the three key problems of the Combined Service Forces, the
                            political commissar system, and the streamlining of the army itself.</p>

                            have had a useful function. On Formosa, it is a military-bureaucratic
                            colossus which hoards China’s present stockpiles of military supply. It
                            is the home base for the uselessly subsidized military and semi-military
                            supernumeraries. It directs military raids upon the agricultural and
                            industrial economy. While the Chinese Air Force and Navy operate largely
                            independent supply systems the Combined Service Forces hamstrings
                            General Sun Li-jen’s best efforts to obtain minimum requirements for the
                            troops themselves. It is headed up by two General Huangs who are little
                            more than instruments of the Generalissimo’s personal whims and wishes
                            as communicated to them by the Chief of Staff, General Chou Chih-jou. US

                            Ching-kuo, as Chairman of the Kuomintang Reform Committee, has reduced
                            the size of the Central Committee of the Party from 238 to 20 and
                            through this sensitive point exercises considerable indirect and
                            semi-police influence. General Chase has not set for himself the goal of
                            reforming Formosa. However the secret police, counter intelligence,
                            informer, and commissar activities in the army constitute—according to
                            both General Sun Li-jen and General Chase—an almost insuperable barrier
                            to the achievement of good military discipline, high morale, and
                            effective combat potential.</p>
                        <p>To streamline a military establishment requires, of course, some
                            knowledge of its size and organization. One is impressed on Formosa by
                            the lack of good statistical information on its actual size. I heard
                            estimates ranging from 350,000 to 800,000. General Chase has set for
                            himself the target of training and equipping 600,000—and no more. It
                            should be mentioned, parenthetically, that Colonel Rector, Chief of the
                            Air Section of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, has been very well
                            impressed by the success of the Chinese Air Force in preserving its
                            organization, maintaining its records, and carrying out training
                            operations. Its records are exact and complete. Its commissions are well
                            earned. There are only 13 generals in the Air Force as a whole. He
                            believes that the Air Force could achieve peak combat efficiency in six
                            to seven weeks after the arrival of fighter aircraft and within eight
                            weeks after the arrival of light bombers. The story of the army is very
                            different. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has persuaded the
                            Ministry of National Defense to reduce from 12 to 10 the number of
                            Chinese armies and from 38 to 21 the number of Chinese divisions. This
                            contraction of organization strength will result in the elimination of
                            “paper” units and bring to full strength units actually to be carried on
                            the books. This organizational reform is already taking place. The
                            organizational reform, however, is, in General Chase’s opinion, merely a
                            prerequisite of a reform in military thinking. The Chinese Communist
                            army fighting in Korea is an <pb n="1821" xml:id="pg_1821" facs="0363"
                            />excellent infantry army. The Chinese forces on Formosa can deal with
                            them only by learning to employ the tactics developed by the United
                            Nations forces in Korea. In short, the Chinese must learn the meaning of
                            the word “teamwork”, must master a wide range of weapons besides the
                            rifle, and must learn to use them together. General Chase estimates that
                            after arrival of US hardware a training program of eight months will be
                            needed to achieve the results he desires. The Chinese common soldier, as
                            I was able to see him myself on Formosa, looked good. I have been seeing
                            Chinese armies all my life and most recently in West China during World
                            War II. The troops I saw on Formosa looked healthier, were better
                            clothed, were furnished with more rifles, were quicker in their response
                            to discipline, and generally more alert than any large number of Chinese
                            troops I have ever seen before. I talked with General Sun’s two
                            attractive and intelligent young aides, and also to a number of Chinese
                            officers, including five or six generals of no political consequence,
                            but bearing important operational responsibilities. They struck me as
                            being highly competent in their fields of responsibility. Although my
                            impression is admittedly based on superficial evidence, I am convinced
                            that General Chase has good human material with which to work. I am
                            unable to evaluate the disturbing view expressed to me by Colonel
                            Barrett and Major Jack Young, who has recently been in command of a
                            combat unit in Korea, that perhaps General Chase’s most serious problem
                            is to create and preserve combat capabilities in an army which is
                            growing older month by month, is not being replenished by new bodies
                            from or retiring old ones into society, and which, without “blooding”
                            might well become so overtrained as to be incapable of fighting.</p>
                        <p>The military establishment, some characteristics and aspects of which I
                            have just mentioned, is the principal impediment to the accomplishment
                            on Formosa of constructive developments in the political and economic
                            field. If General Chase can bring about the military reforms he desires,
                            particularly in the fiscal and supply fields, there are on Formosa, in
                            my opinion, resources which will make possible the achievement of good
                            government and a healthly economy capable of meeting the welfare
                            requirements of an especially talented population.</p>
                        <p>One needs to see it to be fully aware of the high quality of Formosan
                            agriculture. The Formosan farmer population is more literate than any in
                            Asia except possibly that in Japan. Under Japanese tutelage it has
                            developed very advanced farming techniques. Farm production is highly
                            diversified and includes two cash crops, rice and sugar, which figure
                            prominently in earning Formosa’s foreign exchange. Rice production now
                            exceeds pre-liberation levels, although exports lag. The <pb n="1822"
                                xml:id="pg_1822" facs="0364"/>Formosan farm population is by and
                            large well off. Nowhere did I hear that Communism had made the slightest
                            headway in the rural sector of the Island. The Formosan farmer and his
                            farm associations, however, draw comparisons between Japanese and the
                            present Chinese administration which are favorable to the Japanese. In
                            retrospect, they feel that the one flaw in Japanese policy on Formosa as
                            it affected them was that the Japanese regarded them as second class
                            citizens; this the Chinese from the Mainland have avoided doing.
                            However, the Chinese National Government’s tax, credit, and pricing
                            policies have, the Formosan farmers feel, been administered with such
                            irregularity, stupidity, and harshness as to wipe out the benefits which
                            they expected to realize from the land reform programs instituted under
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCRR1">JCRR</gloss> two years and more ago. Taxes,
                            levies, and “voluntary” contributions have been called for by local and
                            provincial governments but also, and most exasperatingly, by agents of
                            the police and the military. It is claimed that there are seven times as
                            many Chinese police as the Japanese required for a more efficient
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>I saw for myself, and more than that heard glowing accounts from others
                            who had seen far more than I, the accomplishments of the Chinese in the
                            industrial sphere. Since 1945, Formosa’s cotton textile spindleage has
                            risen from 10,000 to, 80,000. Formosa’s power production has risen from
                            a Japanese peak of 152,000 kilowatt hours to 200,000. Production of
                            nitrogenous fertilizers has risen from 11,000 to 76,000 tons. Similar
                            indications of industrial recovery could be given for the cement
                            industry, mining industries, and so on. I saw three efficient textile
                            plants, a fertilizer plant, and the aluminum plant.</p>
                        <p>I talked with the plant managers and was able to obtain from them a
                            picture of what they considered to be the factors obstructing expanded
                            operation of existing plant capacity and enlargement of industrial
                            plant. The best general review of these problems was given me by Mr. Y.
                            C. Wang, General Manager of the Nanyang Cotton Textiles Company in Hong
                            Kong who is concurrently operating a small textile mill in Taipei. These
                            are the points he made: (1) Until recently the security of Formosa was
                            an unknown factor and a deterrent to industrial development and
                            activity. Chinese industrialists now regard Formosa as immeasurably more
                            attractive from that standpoint. (2) Formosan labor is very talented but
                            competitive bidding for labor force makes it excessively mobile and the
                            attractiveness of Formosan farms and the fact of strong family ties with
                            the farms cause migrations from industry to rural areas during harvest
                            and planting seasons. (3) Formosa is short of certain important raw
                            materials, such as raw cotton, but since the US export embargo applies
                            with greater severity to Hong Kong than to Formosa it is felt <pb
                                n="1823" xml:id="pg_1823" facs="0365"/>that it is easier to import
                            raw materials to Formosa than to many other areas, particularly with
                                <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> available to assist in
                            procurement. (4) Unlike Hong Kong, there are no commercial banks on
                            Formosa which extend cheap credit even against mortgaged plant or raw
                            materials. This means industrialists must go into the gray market and
                            pay exorbitant rates of interest. (5) The Government’s tax program is
                            such that industrialists cannot know upon what, or how heavily, taxes
                            will be levied from month to month. Industrialists are constantly
                            threatened by what amounts to military confiscation. (6) Chinese who own
                            capital conceal the fact and live in mortal terror that the police will
                            hold them as hostages or seize the property. (7) The greatest impediment
                            of all to industrial activity and development is the constant threat of
                            currency inflation. From the standpoint of the industrialist it is
                            immaterial at what level the Formosan dollar is stabilized, but without
                            stability the industrialist cannot plan and operate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wang said—and this was confirmed by what I was able to learn in Hong
                            Kong—that there is a large volume of Chinese capital in Hong Kong and
                            Southeast Asia which would welcome opportunities to invest in Formosa if
                            the difficulties here mentioned could in some way be reduced or
                            eliminated. It is my impression—and this is an impression which may not
                            be capable of demonstration—that with stabilization in the value of the
                            currency, and this alone, the contributions of Chinese capital for
                            development purposes, both from Formosa itself and from Hong Kong and
                            Southeast Asia, might exceed within the next twelve to fifteen months by
                            as much as three or four times the contributions which <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> could make.</p>
                        <p>The US Government is fortunate in having on Formosa, available for use by
                            the Chinese official and private business community, the J. G. White
                            Engineering Corporation. Mr. Val de Beausset has gained an enviable
                            position of respect amongst able Chinese economists, engineers, and
                            industrial operators. There is no shortage on Formosa of engineers,
                            technicians, plant managers, and the potential for rapid industrial
                            development on Formosa is very great. Mr. de Beausset believes that with
                            a modest investment of US-financed industrial equipment Formosa has the
                            capability of producing on Formosa items now being imported and
                            producing exportable commodities in a volume which, within two to three
                            years, would render the Island self-supporting—including the maintenance
                            of the military establishment which would have been brought into being
                            by US assistance at that time. This is admittedly an optimistic
                            forecast. If progress is to be made in the direction Mr. de Beausset has
                            been outlining for the Chinese there must first be basic reforms in the
                            fiscal <pb n="1824" xml:id="pg_1824" facs="0366"/>administration of the
                            Island and the establishment of an atmosphere of political and economic
                            self-confidence.</p>
                        <p>Responsible Chinese on Formosa can be divided crudely into those who are
                            “hell bent for return to the Mainland, no matter how, and to hell with
                            Formosa” and those who feel that “we have got to succeed on Formosa or
                            there is not much point in going back to the Mainland”. As one Chinese
                            in the latter group said to me, “China’s present purpose on Formosa
                            should be to run a country which would make the Chinese on the Mainland
                            say, ‘I wish I were there’.”</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo and his entourage belong to, and in fact lead, the
                            former group. I got an insight into some blank spots in their mental
                            processes, I think, when, during a lunch with Madame Chiang Kaishek, she
                            stated without caveat or explanation that the Chinese National
                            Government would be back in Peking next year. It was a simple statement
                            of faith. I was interested, too, to have her say that she and the
                            Generalissimo were making energetic efforts to persuade Mr. H. H.
                                Kung<note n="6" xml:id="d203fn6">H. H. Kung, former Chinese Minister
                                of Finance, 1933–1944, was living in the United States.</note> to
                            return to Formosa, presumably to resume his responsibility as Minister
                            of Finance. She spoke in the most glowing terms of his great genius in
                            running the Ministry of Finance throughout the Japanese war. She seemed
                            to have no feeling whatever of what impression would be produced upon
                            Chinese and American opinion by an announcement of his return to Formosa
                            as a high authority in the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>No Chinese with whom I talked, except those who without explanation
                            expected that World War III would miraculously restore the Kuomintang to
                            Peking, appeared to think that the reconquest of the China mainland can
                            be accomplished by military pressure alone. Soon after my arrival in
                            Formosa I tried to find evidence that the Chinese were attempting to
                            work out an ideological appeal of some sort to the Chinese on the
                            mainland, sick of and terrified by Communist police authority.</p>
                        <p>I brought this question up at a dinner which Dr. Chiang Mon-lin arranged
                            for me with Mr. Hollington Tong,<note n="7" xml:id="d203fn7">Managing
                                director of the Broadcasting Corporation of China and a member of
                                the Kuomintang Central Advisory Committee.</note> and Mr. K. Y. Yin.
                            Mr. Hollington Tong is the Chief of the Generalissimo’s propaganda and
                            publicity services. Mr. K. Y. Yin is the head of the Central Trust. In
                            order to put my question in a historical context, I referred to the fact
                            that there appeared to be in Chinese history since about 150 B. C. two
                            theories of Government. One was the political theory of the Chinese
                            legalists who perfected a doctrine for an authoritarian police state.
                            The other was Confucianist theory upon which most Chinese dynasties <pb
                                n="1825" xml:id="pg_1825" facs="0367"/>based their political
                            institutions—a theory of federalism under the general sovereign guidance
                            of a benevolent emperor. I asked if they felt that the Chinese
                            Communists belonged to this Chinese legalistic tradition or whether
                            Chinese Communism was a completely foreign importation. All agreed that
                            the Chinese Communist regime was allied to Russia, was dependent upon
                            the USSR for support, and had borrowed a part of its vocabulary from
                            Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist political writings. Notwithstanding this
                            fact, however, Dr. Chiang Mon-lin regarded the Chinese Communist
                            movement as essentially Chinese. Mr. Hollington Tong dissented and
                            considers it foreign. Mr. Yin was asked to cast his vote and he
                            associated himself with the view of Dr. Chiang.</p>
                        <p>I see some significance in this conversation beyond that on the surface.
                            It seems to me of the utmost importance to recognize that expression of
                            such disagreements in opinion could not be found anywhere in Communist
                            China, particularly where a foreigner was present. If there are
                            characteristics of a police state on Formosa, those characteristics are
                            certainly a mild version of what is found where the Communists have
                            established themselves.</p>
                        <p>When I inquired what ideology, perhaps based upon the Chinese tradition,
                            might serve as an alternative to Communist ideology, Mr. Hollington Tong
                            immediately replied that it was the San Min Chu I (the Three People’s
                            Principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen<note n="8" xml:id="d203fn8">Leader of the
                                Chinese Revolution of 1911.</note>—nationalism, people’s livelihood,
                            and the people’s democracy). Dr. Chiang Mon-lin and Mr. Yin felt that
                            the San Min Chu I had no dynamic appeal whatever to the Chinese people
                            and something else—they knew not what—was called for.</p>
                        <p>I talked at a later time with Mr. Chu Chia-hua, an intimate friend of the
                            Generalissimo and formerly a general secretary of the Kuomintang, on
                            this subject. He said that the San Min Chu I was hopeless as an
                            instrument of political or psychological appeal to the Chinese people.
                            The Chinese are fed up with the Russians and they would understand the
                            principle of nationalism. That, he said, however, was not enough. What
                            to add to it, he did not know.</p>
                        <p>… prior to my departure from Taipei . . . . I raised again the question
                            of usefulness of the San Min Chu I as a theoretical and philosophical
                            alternative to Chinese Communist doctrine. Without dissent, they all
                            agreed that it was out-dated and that there was nothing to take its
                            place. To keep the discussion going, I threw out the suggestion that a
                            new San Min Chu I might be formulated in the following terms: (1)
                            “Horizontalism instead of verticalism”, (2) “Benevolent Pao Chia-ism”,
                            (3) “Retain rice and clothing according to <pb n="1826" xml:id="pg_1826"
                                facs="0368"/>individual effort”. These, I suggested, were slogans
                            simple to comprehend in Chinese terms and yet capable of infinite
                            theoretical elaboration.</p>
                        <p>Horizontalism would, of course, be the antithesis of the central
                            authority which is exercised through a vertical chain of command by the
                            Chinese Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>Benevolent Pao Chia-ism would imply and require a shift of responsibility
                            for social action and discipline from external police authority, which
                            probes into the entrails of every family, to groups which at the grass
                            root level would be responsible to and for each other.</p>
                        <p>Retain rice and clothing according to individual effort would be the
                            antithesis to the Communist subordination of the agricultural and
                            industrial life of the country, regardless of individual hardship or
                            interest, to the demands of the Party, the army, and the
                            bureaucracy.</p>
                        <p>In a sense these slogans describe traditional Chinese society. The group
                            with whom I talked, while unanimously acknowledging the need for some
                            philosophical alternative to the Communists were understandably reticent
                            about commenting on the slogans which I had thrown out for their
                            comment. On reflection, it seemed to me easy to understand why.</p>
                        <p>Traditional Chinese society has been incapable historically of
                            accumulating capital resources which are essential for the operation of
                            a modern industrial state. A democratic—or a traditional—alternative to
                            Communist theories of social organization offers little or no promise
                            for the rapid development of China along modern industrial lines. The
                            intellectual dilemma of Chinese leadership on Formosa appears to flow
                            from the fact that they know that if they return to the Mainland to
                            throw off the pro-Russian bias of the Peking regime they might well be
                            compelled to preserve most of the centralism and authoritarianism of the
                            Chinese Communists, unless they could rely upon a massive commitment of
                            US resources for the feeding of the Chinese population, for the support
                            of the Government, and for the development of China’s industry. This is
                            something upon which they obviously could not rely.</p>
                        <p>If this diagnosis is correct it contains certain implications for the
                            objectives we should seek in Formosa and for our expectations.</p>
                        <p>We should not expect Formosa, however well administered, to become a
                            prototype for mainland China. Formosa is potentially a surplus economy,
                            perhaps even with its present military establishment. China is almost
                            certain to be a deficit economy at least for the next quarter
                            century.</p>
                        <p>What should be sought in Formosa is a society led by Chinese who, with
                            our help and in Formosa’s favorable economic environment, can come to be
                            regarded as <hi rend="italic">successful Chinese leaders</hi>. If that
                            leadership <pb n="1827" xml:id="pg_1827" facs="0369"/>can remain in fact
                            Chinese and look Chinese and be persuaded that our purpose on Formosa is
                            to help them achieve Chinese solutions to their problems, that will
                            offer a hope and an inspiration to the Chinese suffering Communist
                            tyranny on the Mainland who will see in one province of China, free of
                            Russian domination, successful Chinese leadership meeting the welfare
                            needs of the people and preserving the important Chinese values of
                            freedom of speech, thought, religion, and association.</p>
                        <p>For this to come about, the present leadership, policies, and programs of
                            the military and police establishments must be purged of its evils. I
                            came away from Formosa persuaded that General Chase is excellently
                            qualified to perform this task and that there are better-than-even
                            chances that he can do it.</p>
                        <p>I came away from Formosa also greatly impressed by the harmony of
                            interest, purpose, and operations of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> missions
                            under the tactfully handled guidance of Minister Rankin in the Embassy.
                            The Chinese are not offered opportunities for pitting Americans against
                            each other or engaging in wide end runs. The crux of the immediate
                            problem for Washington, it seems to me, is to give to the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> all the cooperation it needs in
                            acquiring competent personnel in the field of military finance, adequate
                            personnel for checking operations of the Chinese military establishment,
                            and such <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> assistance as will
                            contribute the military and short-term economic objectives <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> has set for itself. Success in the
                            short term may make possible institution by the Chinese, with the
                            guidance which Mr. Moyer’s <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> staff
                            could competently provide, of a “Dodge Mission” type of economic
                            recovery program in which there could be a gradual, but basic shift from
                            commodity assistance to industrial development. It is wishful, however,
                            to think in these promising terms—possible economic self support for
                            Formosa through industrial expansion—unless the operations of the
                            military establishment in the economic sphere are brought under the
                            effective control of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> in the

                            on own initiative, had referred to position of Amers and other fon natls
                            in China. Chen argued Indon had recently arrested 700 Chinese for
                            security reasons; therefore why should Indon take up defense of some 40
                            Amers arrested for similar reasons? Chen insisted this point though
                            Indon Charge pointed out that 80 were Chinese, balance being
                            Indonesians.</p>
                        <p>Lamb obtained impression from above that <gloss target="#t_CPG1"

                                n="1" xml:id="d210fn1">Telegram 187 from Calcutta, not printed,
                                requested instructions on two points raised by the Tibetan official
                                to whom the letter signed by Ambassador Henderson had been shown:
                                (1) whether the United States would provide financial assistance for
                                a retinue of 150 to 300 for the Dalai Lama, in order that officials
                                might bring their families with them, and (2) what the U.S. attitude
                                would be if the Dalai Lama were to stay in Tibet but send out a
                                group of trusted officials to organize resistance (793B.00/10–451).
                                The Embassy in New Delhi commented in telegram 1266, not printed,
                                that a small retinue of possibly 100 would be preferable, but that
                                it might be increased if the destination was India or Ceylon, where
                                expenses would be lower than elsewhere; the Embassy believed that,
                                because of the Dalai Lama’s symbolic significance, an outside
                                resistance group would have little chance of success if he remained

                            mentioned in above para.</p>
                        <p>We believe publicity on above at present moment through statements by
                            Generalissimo would serve no useful purpose. Progress to date is result
                            extensive discussions between Chi and Amers on all points plus detailed
                            consideration within Chi Govt both at top and working levels. Represents
                            notable restriction financial economy of Chi milit and shift to unified
                            civilian economic control with Generalissimo’s full approval on general
                            principles but with details and carrying out to be left to appropriate
                            agencies. Basic facts already widely known and appreciated in Chi Govt
                            circles. Practical implementation now under way involves concrete steps
                            which will make clear to ever increasing number the full implications.
                            Meanwhile, we believe wiser build up position of responsible agencies as
                            instruments of govt and to play down old idea that Generalissimo
                            personally handles all details of state which increasingly not the case.

                                until he had had an opportunity to consult with Foreign Minister

                            foreigners well treated. Chen had previously made equally “astounding

                            Generalissimo’s paramount influence on Formosa, it is necessary that US

                            Yatung had been instructed (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                            302 July 21) pass to Dalai Lama info that <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                            had been carried out thru third party since direct access Dalai Lama
                            impossible but he promised check <gloss target="#t_MEA1">MEA</gloss>
                            info and inform me. I asked if not definite that Dalai Lama had been
                            informed <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attitude, and if this
                            attitude unchanged, whether Sinha, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            rep Lhasa, might be instructed pass same info to Dalai Lama there.
                            Bajpai replied <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attitude re asylum
                            unchanged but that in present circumstances Lhasa, <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> wld be unable take such initiative
                            since it wld be open to construction <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            endeavoring encourage Dalai Lama leave Tibet. I then asked whether Sinha
                            informed that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> prepared grant asylum
                            to Dalai Lama if latter desired. Bajpai said he felt sure Sinha so
                            informed but that he wld investigate and wld have him informed if any
                            doubt existed. He added Sinha wld inform any authorized rep of Dalai
                            Lama re <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> attitude if such rep shld
                            make inquiry.</p>
                        <p>Above inquiries were made after explaining to Bajpai that from several
                            Tib sources Emb has heard that Dalai Lama had desired take refuge India
                            but had been discouraged by apparent lack <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                >GOI</gloss> sympathy for Tibet and in last analysis by failure or
                            inability receive assurances from <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            that it prepared accord him asylum. I added that it wld be most
                            unfortunate if simple mischance or misunderstanding shld result in
                            damaging effects on welfare of Tibet and possibly even on personal
                            safety Dalai Lama. Latter from all reports was intelligent, courageous
                            youth who deserved better fate.</p>
                        <p>Bajpai gave vent to some expressions regret but pointed out that there
                            had been little that India cld offer Tibet in way of polit or practical
                            support. He concluded by remarking that there now seemed little or no
                            possibility of Dalai Lama leaving Tibet even if he desired since <gloss

                        <p>1534. Re Calcutta despatch 169, October 13 and Contel 221, October 27 to
                                Dept.<note n="1" xml:id="d219fn1">Despatch 169 from Calcutta
                                recommended that the Department make every effort to have the
                                Treasury Department modify its restrictions on Tibetan wool; the
                                Consulate General thought this would be a gesture of good will which
                                might encourage the Tibetans to resist the Chinese Communists
                                (893B.24222/10–1351). Telegram 221 from Calcutta, not printed,
                                recommended urgent action to relax the Treasury restrictions lest
                                the Tibetans sell the next season’s wool to the Chinese, who
                                reportedly needed wool for blankets, “possibly needed in Korea”
                                (893B.24222/10–2751).</note> Even though US Treasury regulations
                            permit import Tibetan wool into US (paragraph 2, <gloss
                                target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 566 September 10), it appears
                            present procedure may be hampering shipment (ConGen despatch 169,
                            October 13).<note n="2" xml:id="d219fn2">Not printed.</note> Tibetan
                            authorities and people seem to interpret non-shipment indicative
                            unfriendly attitude on part US at time when Chinese Commies endeavoring
                            consolidate position Lhasa. Embassy strongly recommends consideration be
                            given by Dept and Treasury to application Treasury regulations in such
                            way as to simplify import into US of Tibetan wool which does not come
                            from Commie-controlled area of Tibet. One way might be to license
                            shipments and payments for short-term periods in names Indian exporters
                            and American importers who are reliable and who have customarily dealt
                            in Tibetan wool. These parties could file copies licenses with National
                            City Bank and other negotiating banks in Calcutta. Effect foregoing
                            procedure would be to protect US interest, provide assurance to Tibetans
                            US would take its wool under proper circumstances, and keep wool from
                            going to China.</p>

                            for your consideration the attached copy of a memorandum from the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff, dated 24 October 1951, on the US position with respect
                            to Formosa. This memorandum comments on the two draft position
                                papers<note n="1" xml:id="d221fn1">The two draft position papers,
                                both dated October 2, are not printed. One paper was based on the
                                assumption that an armistice would be concluded in Korea; for the
                                text of the final position paper based on that assumption, see <ref

                                was based on the assumption that there would be no armistice at the
                                time the question of Formosa came under consideration at the Sixth
                                Session of the General Assembly; for text, see <ref

                                papers, dated September 25, are filed with a covering memorandum
                                from Troy Perkins to W. Bradley Connors, September 26, 1951
                                (611.94A/9–2651).</note> prepared by the Department of State
                            regarding the position that the United States should take on the
                            question of Formosa should it arise during the forthcoming Sixth Session
                            of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>The views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with which I concur, reinforce
                            what appears to be the intent of these two position papers to <pb
                                n="1842" xml:id="pg_1842" facs="0384"/>prevent and avoid
                            consideration of this subject at the forthcoming Session. Therefore, I
                            strongly recommend that the revisions proposed by the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 be incorporated in the final position
                            paper for the US Delegation.</p>
                        <p>But this memorandum of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also sets forth US
                            security requirements regarding Formosa on the basis of developments
                            since their memorandum of 2 January 1951 on the strategic importance of
                            Formosa. In this respect, I would like to call your attention in

                            attached memorandum I believe that it might be useful to refer this

                                            7,850,000 persons. Of these, approximately 1,800,000, or

                                            is considered under circumstances in which the security
                                            interest of the United States is not paramount, such

                                            Chinese Nationalist people on Formosa could deprive the
                                            United States of military support of allies (present and

                                                  avoid discussion of the question of Formosa at the
                                                  Sixth Session. Public discussion in present
                                                  circumstances could only expose and underline the
                                                  differences between us and our allies. We should

                                                  our views, that while the armistice ended
                                                  hostilities, peace and security were not yet fully

                                                  that a satisfactory permanent solution could be
                                                  achieved at this time. The question could be
                                                  re-examined when there is a political settlement
                                                  in Korea or when the armistice had been in effect
                                                  sufficient time to establish Chinese Communist

                                decision on the ground that at this late stage, representations
                                might do more harm than good.</item>

                                nationals. Chou En-lai insisted that this was a question of internal

                        <p>Mr. Campbell permitted me to read a letter which had been received from
                            Mr. George Patterson, Canadian Consul General in Shanghai. He said he
                            was not authorized to leave the letter with me or permit me to take
                            notes on it. However, since it had been brought out of China by “safe
                            hand”, namely, the Indian Ambassador, Mr. Panikkar, Mr. Patterson had
                            discussed the situation a little more frankly than he was able to do in
                            other communications and consequently the Embassy thought it might be of
                            interest to us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Patterson pointed out the difficulty of his communications
                            facilities, stating that his only method of transmitting coded messages
                                <pb n="1850" xml:id="pg_1850" facs="0392"/>was through the British.
                            This involved five days transit time to Peiping and the necessity for
                            the message being read and encoded by his British colleagues.
                            Consequently his communications with Ottawa had been restricted largely
                            to selected press clippings.</p>
                        <p>The following are the highlights of Mr. Patterson’s comments on the
                            situation in China:</p>
                        <p>Few people outside of China appreciate the “sweep of the revolution” and
                            the fact that it has penetrated every phase of the lives of the Chinese.
                            The bureacracy has been built up to the extent that it touches the daily
                            activities of practically every Chinese individual who is thus
                            constantly aware of what the government is doing and what he is expected
                            to do. It is a delusion to think that there is any substantial
                            resistance to the present regime. The Communist Government has brought
                            efficiency, has removed to a large extent the corruption which existed
                            under the <gloss target="#t_KMT1">KMT</gloss> regime, and has succeeded
                            in spurring the Chinese to a high degree of activity. The Chinese are
                            working hard in every field and making great economic progress.</p>
                        <p>The peasants are in general behind the regime. They believe that Mao has
                            built his strength largely on the peasantry and that their welfare is
                            being enhanced by the policies of the Communist Government. This
                            estimate is contradictory to one made by Dean Trivett, Canadian Dean of
                            the Cathedral in Shanghai, who recently visited Washington. Dean Trivett
                            stated that the peasants were turning against the regime due to their
                            disillusionment with its fulfillment of promises made to them. In view
                            of the restricted opportunities for observation and gathering
                            information available to either Mr. Patterson or Dean Trivett, it
                            appears to me that the validity of their generalizations regarding “the
                            attitude of Chinese peasants” is open to considerable doubt, to say the
                            least.</p>
                        <p>The police controls are, of course, onerous and the Chinese chafe under
                            them. There has been a great deal of ostentation with regard to the
                            arrest and execution of large number of Chinese citizens. However,
                            according to Mr. Patterson, the average Chinese who sees these so-called
                            “criminals” being driven through the streets, believes them guilty of
                            crimes and deserving of punishment. Most Chinese do not, therefore,
                            resent these arrests and do not believe that people are being executed
                            just because of previous membership in the <gloss target="#t_KMT1"
                                >KMT</gloss>. This statement differs from the impression gleaned
                            from a conversation with Dean Trivett who thought a prevalent attitude
                            was revealed by one of his Chinese friends who placed his arms in the
                            position of being handcuffed and remarked, “Soon, we shall all be like
                            this!”</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Consul General discussed the situation of the remaining
                            foreigners in Shanghai as being one of continual nervousness and
                            anxiety. A number, of course, have been arrested. The others <pb
                                n="1851" xml:id="pg_1851" facs="0393"/>are subjected to endless
                            regulations and red tape. However, Mr. Patterson believed that most of
                            these regulations could be explained on a logical basis and, except for
                            the one which prohibited any departing foreigner from taking more than
                            20 ounces of silver out of the country, did not regard them as
                            particularly unfair.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Patterson concluded with a description of the oppressive and ominous
                            atmosphere which he admitted affected the attitude of foreigners living
                            in Shanghai. He said that no doubt psychologists could easily explain
                            it. He said that although one could walk freely in the streets, travel
                            beyond Shanghai was restricted and one had constantly the feeling of
                            being under surveillance and being subject to arrest or some other dire
                            calamity at any time.</p>

                        <p>Dr. T. F. Tsiang called by appointment on the Secretary at 5:30 on the
                            afternoon of November 17.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Tsiang explained at the outset that the purpose of his call was to
                            enlist American support of the Chinese resolution condemning the USSR
                            for violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945.<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d228fn1">The Chinese resolution had been originally put
                                forward at the Fourth Session of the U.N. General Assembly in 1949;
                                it declared that the USSR had, by aiding the Chinese Communists,
                                violated the U.N. Charter and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14,
                                1945, and it urged all member states to avoid giving the Chinese
                                Communists any military or economic aid, to withhold recognition
                                from the Communist regime, and to respect the political independence
                                and territorial and administrative integrity of China. For the text
                                of the original resolution, together with related documentation, see

                                        rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, pp. 144</ref> ff. On December 8,
                                1949, the General Assembly referred the item to its Interim
                                Committee for study; on December 1, 1950, the Assembly instructed
                                the Interim Committee to continue inquiry on the question. On
                                November 13, 1951, the Assembly decided to include the item in the
                                agenda of its Sixth Session and referred the item to the First
                                Committee for consideration and report.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>After briefly reviewing the history of this resolution from the time it
                            was first presented to the Fourth Session of the General Assembly up to
                            the present, Dr. Tsiang stated he realized that the objectives sought in
                            certain sections of the resolution had either already been partially
                            achieved or, as in the case of the third paragraph of the substantive
                                <pb n="1852" xml:id="pg_1852" facs="0394"/>part of the resolution in
                            which non-recognition of the Peiping regime was recommended, it would be
                            impossible for a number of states which had already recognized the
                            Chinese Communist regime to support this part of the resolution. For
                            these reasons, Dr. Tsiang felt that, from a practical viewpoint, it
                            would be wise to concentrate on the first part of the substantive
                            section which in essence calls for a “moral condemnation” of the USSR
                            for having violated the Sino-Soviet pact of 1945 and the UN Charter. Dr.
                            Tsiang claimed that his government could produce ample proof and
                            evidence of Soviet violations of the pact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed as to the advisability of dropping sections 2, 3 and
                            4 from the substantive part of the resolution for the reasons already
                            given by Dr. Tsiang. With respect to Part 1, the Secretary underlined
                            the fundamental importance of furnishing convincing evidence of Soviet
                            violations of the pact, pointing out that the General Assembly could not
                            very well be expected to take action solely on the basis of unsupported
                            charges. If satisfactory evidence were forthcoming, the American
                            Delegation would support a revised resolution along the lines proposed
                            by Dr. Tsiang.</p>
                        <p>In order that Dr. Tsiang could keep the U.S. Delegation informed of
                            further developments, it was agreed that Ambassador Key should place him
                            in touch with those members of the Delegation principally concerned with
                            the Sino-Soviet item.</p>

                        <p>Following his interview with the Secretary, Dr. Tsiang observed to
                            Ambassador Key that while personally he was convinced that the only way
                            in which to obtain effective support from the General Assembly for the
                            resolution was to eliminate from the latter all but section 1 and to

                            difficulty in bringing around certain members of his delegation to this

                            original resolution should remain unaltered. He felt that his talk with
                            the Secretary would strengthen his hands in dealing with these “die

                                the USSR had violated the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 14, 1945; no

                            point said that he wished to communicate something to him in strictist
                            confidence and explained that it had been suggested to Israel from
                            American sources that it would be helpful if Israel were to set up a
                            legation in Peiping. Mr. Sharett alluded somewhat vaguely to United
                            States official quarters in this respect and said that Israel was giving
                            very careful thought to it. He added that if the establishment of a
                            legation took place, he felt that it might be of much help to the
                            Western cause, of which Israel feels itself an organic part. He
                            reiterated what he had indicated in another part of his conversation,
                            viz: “Russia speaks to Israel but not to the United States”. He then
                            repeated his previous assurance to the Secretary, not to be concerned
                            over what Israel does, indicating that it would be for the common good.
                            The Secretary made no comment.</p>

                            Budget and Financial Controls.</p>
                        <p>At 10:30 this morning I called on President Chiang Kai-shek in order to
                            present Dr. Hubert G. Schenck, the new Chief of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>/China Mission. After an initial
                            exchange of courtesies, the President asked Dr. Schenck what he
                            considered to be the major problem here. Dr. Schenck referred the
                            question to me, and I expressed the opinion that our major problem is to
                            make the most effective use of all available resources, both Chinese and
                            American, in developing our joint programs on Formosa. I said that I
                            thought our resources this year would be adequate for the purpose, but
                            that there would be various limiting factors, such as the availability
                            of certain commodities and military equipment, which necessitate close
                            and constant coordination and study if optimum results are to be
                            obtained.</p>
                        <p>I then asked the President’s opinion on the effectiveness of the Economic
                            Stabilization Board, with particular reference to its new duties in the
                            budgetary field. I remarked that giving the Board responsibility for
                            studying and discussing all budgets, military and civilian, national and
                            local, accomplishes the important function of centralizing and
                            correlating all basic information on government finances before it is
                            transmitted to the Executive Yuan. I expressed the opinion that the
                            coordinated budget planning thus provided for would be most valuable in
                            preserving economic stability and obtaining maximum results from the
                            funds expended.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he was pleased by the way the Economic
                            Stabilization Board is carrying out its budgetary responsibilities. In
                            particular, he expressed appreciation of American help and advice in
                            this connection. He hoped that we would help them find additional ways
                            of saving money and thereby bring the budget into balance. <pb n="1856"
                                xml:id="pg_1856" facs="0398"/>I noted with gratification that the
                            Economic Stabilization Board is to be supplied regularly with full
                            information on current income and expenditures under all headings,
                            including those of all Government-controlled enterprises. I thought that
                            centralizing all available facts and figures in this way is essential to
                            making the best use of all of our resources.</p>
                        <p>Finally I inquired as to what he had heard was being accomplished by
                            General Chase’s fiscal officers, who are acting in an advisory capacity
                            to the Ministry of National Defense. The President replied that he had
                            received no direct reports in this connection, but he knew that they
                            were being very helpful in preparing the 1952 budget. He appreciated
                            this assistance.</p>

                                >GOI</gloss> be invited informally to the apparent reluctance of US
                            importers to purchase Tibetan wool at premium prices, attributable, in
                            part, to the high <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> tax levy, which
                            makes Tibetan wool less competitive in world markets. Any indication of
                            willingness of the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to consider a
                            reduction of its tax levy should be reported by telegram.</p>

                            Members, the Department of State has noted that the memorandum of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff is in the nature of a commentary on the position
                            paper prepared for use of the United States Delegation to the Sixth
                            Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and that,
                            accordingly, the memorandum of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in its present
                            form could scarcely be circulated without circulating the position
                            paper. This position paper has been prepared within the framework of
                            existing national security policy, notably <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 48/5, and consequently in the Department’s view there
                            is no reason to request the renewed consideration by the Council of the
                            approved policy in the paper. However, should the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            desire to propose a re-examination by the National Security Council of
                            U. S. policy with respect to Formosa, the Department would of course
                            have no objection.</p>

                            <p>The policy of the United States is to deny Formosa to any Chinese
                                regime aligned with or dominated by the U.S.S.R. and expedite the
                                strengthening of the defensive capabilities of Formosa. As appears
                                below, no permanent disposition of Formosa which would be acceptable
                                to the principal interested governments appears possible at this
                                time. Our immediate objective therefore is to postpone the issue,
                                and work so far as possible toward the development of an acceptable
                                solution, keeping in mind the importance of maintaining the maximum

                                    by a plebiscite at a later date. The mainland Chinese and the
                                    National Government would probably oppose it. There is also
                                    serious doubt whether this arrangement would adequately
                                    safeguard the island against seizure by the Communists by
                                    subversion or invasion. In any event, Nationalist control of the
                                    island excludes this solution now. </item>

                            <p>Unlike the Korean question, where our position is supported by an
                                important majority in the United Nations and where we are able to
                                engage in negotiations without danger of isolation, our negotiating
                                position on the Formosa problem is most difficult. We cannot agree
                                to withdraw the Seventh Fleet under existing circumstances in view
                                of the danger that the Chinese Communists would take over the
                                island. We are equally unable to indicate that we agree that Formosa
                                should ultimately become part of China since we do not know what
                                Government will control China nor are we in position to support
                                other proposals for the disposition of the island. Our military
                                strength, particularly in the Far East, is still limited. Thus, our
                                position leaves very little room for negotiation at this time.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, after an armistice we may be faced with a pressure
                                to have us agree to negotiations on Formosa, particularly if a
                                “peace atmosphere” should develop in Paris at the Sixth Assembly.
                                This pressure may come not only from the Asians, but also from our
                                Western European friends who accepted our decision to neutralize the
                                island at the most only as a temporary military expedient made
                                necessary by the aggression in Korea. Those who will advocate
                                negotiations will point to the fact that the United States itself,
                                prior to the large scale Chinese intervention in Korea, placed the
                                question of Formosa on the agenda of the Assembly; and that
                                Secretary Acheson indicated in the Joint Senate Committee hearings
                                the willingness of the United States to discuss Formosa when the
                                fighting in Korea is terminated, and the aggressor ceases the
                                defiance to the United Nations. Finally, the Communists will again
                                press this question and probably renew the charges made in the
                                Security Council and the Fifth Assembly that our action with respect
                                to Formosa constitutes aggression.</p>

                            <p>Following an armistice we may agree to participate in a conference on
                                a political settlement for Korea insisting that negotiations in this
                                conference must be limited to Korea.</p>
                            <p>We would oppose the calling of a special conference to consider Far
                                Eastern problems (including Formosa) until there is a political
                                settlement of the Korean problem. At that time we may not oppose
                                discussion of other Far Eastern problems in an appropriate
                                conference in which all parties with interests in the various
                                questions to be discussed would participate.</p>
                            <p>We should also make every effort to discourage consideration of the
                                ultimate status of Formosa in the Sixth Assembly. As indicated
                                above, no solution acceptable to us appears feasible in the present
                                circumstances and public discussion would only expose the
                                differences between us and our allies.</p>
                            <p>It is likely that our efforts to discourage the consideration of this
                                question in the Sixth Assembly will be successful. However, it is
                                possible that the question may be raised again in a more
                                objectionable form such as in the context of the mission of the
                                Seventh Fleet. Moreover, pressure may develop in the event of an
                                armistice, for the above referred special conference on Far Eastern
                                problems. In such circumstances, it may be desirable for the United
                                States to initiate or support an exhaustive study in the Assembly of
                                the broad question of the ultimate status of Formosa as an
                                alternative to the moves mentioned above. Any substantive
                                recommendations would be abided pending the study.</p>

                            <p>It is the policy of the United States (<gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                                interests. In the light of this policy, an armistice in Korea itself
                                would not so change the basic situation as to warrant terminating
                                the present mission of the Fleet.</p>
                            <p>We are unable to foresee how long it will be necessary and advisable
                                to continue this policy and we must therefore remain free to review
                                it from time to time, in the light of changing circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, if the United. Nations takes up the question of Formosa
                                under present circumstances, on one hand we must avoid any move to
                                force us to agree to withdraw the present mission of the Seventh
                                Fleet. On the other hand we should not commit ourselves to maintain
                                our neutralization policy for any specific period or indefinitely.
                                We should not ask the United Nations to endorse the mission of the

                            <p>If in the circumstances indicated in recommendation 3, the question
                                of Formosa comes up, the United States should endeavor to place
                                emphasis on the need for a peaceful solution of the Formosa question
                                in the interest of the international community and of the people of
                                Formosa. We should say that the problem of ultimate status of
                                Formosa required an extensive study as a question relating to the
                                maintenance of international peace and security under Article 11 and

                                <item>In the Assembly we should make clear our conviction that in
                                    present circumstances the island should not be handed over to
                                    Communist China. We should point out, however, that in our view
                                    the problem of the ultimate status of Formosa should be explored
                                    by the Commission and that we have no specific solution in mind
                                    at this time. We should further state that in our view the
                                    purpose of the Commission is to bring out all relevant factors
                                    and provide a full exchange of views; and that we expect to
                                    formulate our position as the work of the Commission progresses.
                                    Beyond this we should indicate that the Commission should give
                                    consideration to all factors including the Chinese claim to
                                    Formosa, the well-being and wishes of the Formosans themselves,
                                    and the interests of the United Nations in promoting peace and
                                    security in the Western Pacific area. This interest of the
                                    United Nations embraces not only the need for a peaceful
                                    solution of this problem where use of force had been threatened;
                                    it necessitates taking into account such other factors as the
                                    past use of Formosa as a base for military aggression and the
                                    possible future use of it for this purpose. </item>

                        <p>On December 8, 1951, Senator William F. Knowland of California released
                            to the press the names of 32 United States nationals in prison on the
                            China mainland, a list which Assistant Secretary Rusk had sent him at
                            his request, on a confidential basis, with a covering letter of October
                            19, 1951 (293.1111/10–351). On the same day, the State Department made
                            an oral announcement to the press, explaining why it had refrained from
                            publicizing individual cases of Americans imprisoned or detained against
                            their will in China and stating that it was making every effort to free
                            those Americans but that it believed it inadvisable to make public all
                            the steps it was taking. For the substance of the Department’s

                        <p>An exchange of visits and communications has recently occurred between
                            Chinese and American personnel concerned, with reference to the

                            are enclosed with this despatch, as are the few local press accounts
                            relating to this subject which have come to the attention of the Embassy
                            so far.<note n="2" xml:id="d237fn2">For the text of one enclosure, see
                                below; the other enclosures are not here printed. They consisted of
                                reports by Major General Chase and Colonel Barrett of meetings on
                                November 14, 17, and 19 with Lieutenant General Chiang Ching-kuo and
                                other Chinese officers, a statement issued to the press on November
                                24 by Chiang Ching-kuo, and other press reports on the

                        <p>The interesting developments covered in the enclosures to this despatch
                            primarily stem from the report (see first reference despatch) by Major
                            General William C. Chase, Chief of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss>, dated June 15, 1951, and handed to Generalissimo
                            Chiang Kai-shek a few days later. This report was in response to a
                            request by the Generalissimo when General Chase first arrived in Taipei.
                            Point 10 of this report stated, “There is, throughout the Armed Forces,
                            a highly objectionable system of Political Commissars, that acts to
                            penalize initiative and undermine the authority of commanders of all
                            echelons.” While the Generalissimo wrote to General Chase on June 27,
                            1951 that he agreed “in the main with your observations and
                            recommendations”, it soon became evident that he did not find himself in
                            agreement with Point 10. The Generalissimo expressed appreciation for
                            General Chase’s frankness, however, and indicated that he was always
                            ready to discuss in a frank and friendly manner any points of difference
                            which may exist between the Chinese and American authorities. It will be
                            seen from the series of enclosures that Lt. Gen. Chiang Ching-kuo has
                            been equally receptive to frank discussion of the activities of the
                            Political Department, which he directs.</p>
                        <p>General Chase and other American authorities concerned with the
                            activities of the Political Department are by no means satisfied with
                            the organization as it now exists. It is recognized that the Political
                            Department serves some useful purposes—some of which are even
                            indispensable, considering the comparatively low level of political
                            maturity of the Chinese armed forces, and considering the ever-present
                            possibility of the infiltration of subversive elements into the military
                            establishment. The <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> authorities
                            have generally taken the position that there is no objection to
                            political training as such, as long as it does not consume too much
                            time, and as long as it does not introduce a separate chain of command
                            within the military organizations, with the unfortunate results which
                            that would entail. The approach so far has been based on the thesis that
                            the Chinese authorities and their American advisers together can find a
                            basis for modifying and improving the organization of the Political
                            Department so that its objectionable features can be eliminated without
                            affecting its useful activities.</p>
                        <pb n="1866" xml:id="pg_1866" facs="0408"/>
                        <p>The problem of resolving Chinese and American differences in this matter
                            has not been solved, but some tangible progress has been made. Lt. Col.
                            Charles H. Barber of the <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> has been
                            assigned to work in the Political Department, at General Chiang’s
                            request; General Chiang has also invited Americans “to go out into the
                            field to observe the (political) organization as it actually functions
                            in the various services.” The time which a soldier is required to devote
                            to political training has been reduced from 25% to 10% of the total time
                            given to all training activities.</p>
                        <p>In all fairness, it should he pointed out that the Chinese authorities do
                            not consider their Political Officers to be the equivalent of “political
                            commissars”, nor do they call them by this name. The differences between
                            the Communist and the Chinese Nationalist systems, from General Chiang
                            Ching-kuo’s point of view, are dealt with in Section VI of Enclosure No.
                            4.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of a few minor attempts to put words into General
                            Chase’s mouth, there has been no press treatment locally of the
                            standpoint of American officials on this controversial subject. Chinese
                            press treatment in Taipei up to the date of this despatch is included as
                            Enclosures No. 6, 7 and 8.</p>

                                caused by controversial issues such as the Political Warfare Bureau.

                                Naturally I accepted the invitation, but later the meeting was
                                postponed until 0800, 8 November, due to the late arrival of the
                                President in Kaohsiung.</p>
                            <p>I was accompanied to the Beach House in Kaohsiung by Admiral Kwei and
                                Captain Liu Ho Tu, the latter serving as interpreter.</p>
                            <p>The meeting was marked throughout by friendliness and receptiveness
                                on the part of the Gimo. The meeting was opened with the usual
                                greetings and well wishing, and then I proceeded with practically
                                the same talk I had given to Admiral Kwei before. The following is
                                an outline of what I talked about:</p>

                                        <item>Everyone seemed to be of the opinion the military aid
                                            program should be carried out on Formosa, but there was
                                            a lack of sympathy or enthusiasm for a large scale aid
                                            program. Officers were reluctant to approve anything but
                                            a most austere program for the Navy because they had
                                            serious doubts as to the capability of the Chinese to
                                            absorb and carry out a large scale program.</item>

                                        <item>My opinion of the reason for this lack of sympathy is
                                            the many unfavorable reports heard about Formosa. Some
                                            of these reports are incomplete or inaccurate, but all
                                            of them stress the unfavorable side of controversial
                                            issues and never give due credit to favorable sides if
                                            there is such a side.</item>

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. The most damaging and widespread of
                                    these controversial reports are those concerning the Political
                                    Warfare Bureau.</p>
                                <p>These reports indicate that the power and authority vested in the
                                    Political Warfare Officers encroach on the responsibility and
                                    authority of the <gloss target="#t_CO1">CO</gloss>’s.</p>
                                <p>It is strongly felt in our Navy that the military command
                                    structure must be inviolate. The Commanders must have full
                                    authority to carry out their responsibilities. There must be no
                                    coercion, direct or indirect, by non-military or political
                                    observers. We feel that such a flaw in the command structure can
                                    jeopardize the fighting efficiency of an otherwise well
                                    constituted and well trained navy.</p>
                                <p>I am of the opinion that there exists a need for this
                                    organization in China, and although I don’t know everything
                                    about it I am aware of some of its good points as well as bad. I
                                    don’t believe we Americans would object to political training as
                                    such, as long <pb n="1868" xml:id="pg_1868" facs="0410"/>as it
                                    doesn’t consume too much time, and as long as it does not
                                    introduce a separate chain of command within the military
                                    organization.</p>
                                <p>I believe the members of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                                    and the Chinese can by mutual understanding and earnest
                                    cooperation find a basis for modifying and improving this
                                    organization so that no one would object to it, and so that it
                                    would still serve a useful purpose to China.</p>
                                <p>Upon being asked for a recommendation, I stated that I could not
                                    make an official recommendation without sending it thru General
                                    Chase. However, I stated that my recommendations to General
                                    Chase would be along this line: Within each organization of
                                    Navy, afloat and ashore, the duties presently carried out by
                                    members of the Political Warfare Bureau should be assigned to
                                    qualified Naval Officers already serving in those organizations.
                                    (The President seemed receptive to this idea and turned to
                                    Admiral Kwei and told him to take it up with Chiang
                                    Ching-kuo.)</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi>. Some people entertained doubt that we
                                    could carry out a successful training program while there were
                                    other groups such as TAG and Yuan Shan School carrying out
                                    concurrent programs whose aims could be directed along opposite
                                    lines.</p>
                                <p>I too have been opposed to these concurrent programs and I am
                                    pleased that TAG has been concluded and that Yuan Shan School
                                    will close shop at end of present class.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. I also encountered officers who had
                                    the impression that ex-U.S. Navy material was being wantonly
                                    scrapped and sold.</p>
                                <p>All instances of scrapping of which I had become aware have been
                                    justified.</p>
                                <p>I will continue to advise the Chinese Navy in these matters in
                                    accordance with <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>’s request

                                brief comments seemed to indicate assent or agreement. Upon

                                President’s reaction. The Admiral stated that I had told the
                                President things that no one ever had before. “Even the Premier
                                can’t talk like you did to him.” They reiterated emphatically his
                                favorable reaction.</p>

                            Communist China</p>
                        <p>During 1951 it has become steadily more difficult to obtain accurate,
                            up-to-date and extensive information on Communist China from nonofficial
                            sources. The reasons for this are briefly outlined below.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Decreased Flow of American and Foreign Nationals Out
                                of China</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the first of the year there was a large flow of Americans from
                            Communst China running as high as 70 to 80 persons per month. This has
                            now decreased to 16 persons during November. Furthermore, those coming
                            out now have been under house arrest or otherwise isolated from Chinese
                            friends for many months so that their information on recent developments
                            is rather limited. Fairly large numbers of Europeans are still coming
                            out of the mainland but they have also been isolated from Chinese, are
                            generally less willing to talk to American officials and there is often
                            a language problem.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Since the inauguration on February 15, 1951 of Chinese Communist travel
                            restrictions on Chinese coming to Hong Kong and returning <pb n="1870"
                                xml:id="pg_1870" facs="0412"/>to the mainland, the movement of
                            persons across the border of this Colony has been sharply restricted.
                            With the development of the campaign against counter-revolutionaries and
                            the agrarian reform movement there has been a steady trend toward
                            stricter enforcement of these travel restrictions to prevent the
                            departure from Communist China of persons whom the Communists might want
                            to use as a target in either of these campaigns, and to forestall the
                            entry into the mainland of enemy agents. Chinese from provinces other
                            than Kwangtung find it particularly difficult to come to Hong Kong.
                            Persons here who are in close touch with Kwangsi province, for example,
                            report that the flow of refugees from that province has practically
                            ceased. It was reported in the Hong Kong <hi rend="italic">Hsing Tao Jih
                                Pao</hi> for November 21 that issuance of exit or exit-reentry
                            permits for the following types of persons in Kwangtung has been
                            temporarily suspended: (1) students; (2) persons under police
                            supervision or control; (3) landlords who have not yet refunded
                            overcharged rents and interest to their tenants; (4) young shop
                            assistants studying prescribed courses; (5) technical workers; (6)
                            families of landlords; and (7) merchants who have not yet paid the taxes
                            due. While the <hi rend="italic">Hsing Tao Jih Pao</hi> is not a
                            Communist paper, it leans heavily to the left and seems to have unusual
                            access to information on Communist administrative measures, so that this
                            report probably has some basis in fact.</p>
                        <p>It is apparently still possible for persons who have had no political
                            connections or activities in the past, particularly women, to get
                            permits to come to Hong Kong, but if the authorities have the slightest
                            suspicion concerning the background of an applicant, he does not get his
                            permit.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Hong Kong government, concerned over the swollen population of the
                            Colony and deteriorating economic conditions, has recently begun to
                            require Hong Kong entry permits even from Cantonese who desire to enter
                            the Colony. Formerly, although entry permits were required for Chinese
                            from other parts of China, Cantonese were allowed to come in freely,
                            provided they had re-entry permits issued by the Communist
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>A good measure of the extent to which these various restrictions have
                            interfered with travel across the border of the Colony is the fact that
                            the going rate for smuggling a person into Hong Kong, which was only
                            HK$40 to HK$50 a year ago, is now reported to be anywhere from HK$700 to
                            HK$1,000.</p>

                                Chinese</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Even though there is still a small number of Chinese coming into the
                            Colony from Communist China, it is more and more difficult to get from
                            them useful information on mainland conditions.</p>
                        <pb n="1871" xml:id="pg_1871" facs="0413"/>
                        <p>In the first place the Chinese themselves are less able to report
                            accurately on the real thinking and attitudes of people on the mainland
                            because, under the unremitting pressure of Communist thought control
                            methods, people are increasingly prone to conceal their real feelings
                            and to avoid comment on possibly dangerous subjects.</p>
                        <p>Merchants who travel back and forth regularly are afraid to contact a
                            foreigner in Hong Kong, particularly an American official, no matter how
                            clandestinely the meeting may be arranged. They have a healthy respect
                            for the Communist espionage system here, and there have been examples of
                            merchants who have been interrogated closely on their return to China
                            about their relations with the individuals whom the Communists knew they
                            saw in Hong Kong.</p>
                        <p>Even refugees who have fled the mainland for good often have reservations
                            about talking to Americans. They are not at all sure that Hong Kong may
                            not some day be taken by the Communists and they hope that by remaining
                            neutral and inconspicuous they will avoid some day being the object of
                            reprisals. They realize they have no place to go should Hong King be
                            attacked. There is also a prevalent feeling that United States policy is
                            fickle and that the United States in the future may reach some
                            accommodation with the Chinese Communists which would leave
                            anti-Communist Chinese out on a limb. Therefore, they prefer not to
                            identify themselves as anti-Communists even to the extent of giving
                            information to American officials.</p>

                        <p>Although China’s “bamboo curtain” has not become the “iron curtain” which
                            exists in Eastern Europe, there has been a steady movement in that
                            direction for the past year. First-hand reports on mainland conditions
                            are fewer and less comprehensive and the reporting officer is forced to
                            rely to a greater extent upon second or third-hand reports and the
                            output of the official Communist press.</p>

                            Chargé Kaul, Peiping, expressing view (shared by his Swiss colleague)
                            that unwise any US statement to mention by name countries which had
                            interceded with Commie Chi authorities on behalf US Natls. Kaul thought
                            Chi Commies were beginning moderate attitude toward fon natls concerned.
                            He also thought US statement now might result refusal Christmas
                            amenities which Brit and Swiss reps were endeavoring secure. Finally he
                            expressed view mention names countries interceding wld reduce their
                            future influence on behalf fon natls and perhaps cause China take
                            harsher attitude toward prisoners.</p>
                        <p>Menon indicated Bajpai and he inclined agree with Kaul and said <gloss

                            India in any US statement Dept considered necessary. Menon suggested we
                            confine ref to intercession by fon reps Peiping to statement that “reps
                            of several friendly fon powers had been asked to intercede.” He also
                            suggested Dept shld consider delaying statement until after Christmas in
                            order not jeopardize Swiss, Brit efforts on behalf detained Amers.</p>
                        <p>Steere said he questioned Kaul’s judgment that mention countries
                            interceding US behalf wld reduce their future influence such matters; on
                            contrary he thought Chi Commies might have more regard for fon views
                            about mistreatment fon natls if friendly countries were prepared to let
                            it be known they disapproved of such mistreatment. Menon, however, was
                            not to be shaken from his request that no specific mention be made of
                            Ind Govt in above connection.</p>

                            recommendations to the General Assembly or to Member States on the
                            application of sanctions against the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>Any action taken by the General Assembly or by Members on recommendation
                            of the Collective Measures Committee would presumably be analogous to
                            that envisaged in Article 41 of the Charter dealing with the power of
                            the Security Council to call upon Members of the United Nations for
                            measures such as the complete or partial interruption of economic
                            relations and rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other
                            means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that if the Collective Measures Committee considers the
                            matter, it will devote most of its attention to the question of economic
                            sanctions. The United States Representative on the Collective Measures
                            Committee should be given instructions detailing the types of
                            multilateral economic measures, if any, which we consider appropriate to
                            recommend in the circumstances and should be supplied with factual
                            material which will enable him to press for the action desired by the
                            United States.</p>

                            would be carried from Bombay to Communist China aboard a vessel of
                            Norwegian registry. Mr. Hulley requested Mr. Barnett to set forth the
                            details of the problem. Mr. Barnett stated that the Departments of
                            Defense and Commerce had been, for some weeks, disturbed by the fact
                            that there had been off-loaded at Bombay from two Isbrandtsen ships<note

                            hands, either by direct delivery or indirectly. Mr. Barnett said that

                            with location, the name, ownership, and managers of the ship. Later, Mr.
                            Rogers supplied Mr. Aars with information regarding the cargo. Mr. Aars
                            stated that he would communicate these details and the Department’s
                            request to Oslo at once.</p>

                                consideration by the National Security Council. The recommendations
                                in this paper have been discussed by the Advisory Committee on
                                Export Policy. At the meeting of the Advisory Committee the
                                representatives of the Departments of State and Treasury and of the
                                Economic Cooperation Administration requested that the problem be

                                taken.</p>

                                of its responsibilities in the export field under the Defense
                                Production Act and Executive Order No. 10161. I would suggest,
                                therefore, that the Secretary of Agriculture be invited to
                                participate in the Council’s discussion of this paper.</p>

                                <item>United States security export policy was based, until June 25,
                                    1951 [<hi rend="italic">1950</hi>], on the fundamental concept
                                    of avoiding substantial contribution to the war potential of the
                                    Soviet Bloc by a selective control of exports. The active
                                    military aggression, first by North Korea and next by China, has
                                    required U.S. export policy with respect to these areas to go
                                    beyond the mere avoidance of substantial contribution to war
                                    potential. In time of active hostility against U.S. forces,
                                    whether or not these forces are part of a larger frame of
                                    reference such as the U.N., great care must be exercised to
                                    prevent any export which in any way becomes useful to the armies
                                    which are taking American lives. In accord with this principle,
                                    all exports to North Korea were prohibited on June 28, and all
                                    licenses for export of all commodities have been denied to
                                    Communist China since shortly after the Chinese aggression in
                                    Korea. It is to be noted that this new principle is applicable
                                    regardless of its effects on U.S. imports of essential
                                    commodities from aggressor countries, for we cannot, in a period

                                    that, in the case of direct exports to that country, no U.S.
                                    commodities are augmenting the aggressive forces presently
                                    engaged against us. There is and can be, however, no assurance
                                    that commodities exported to the U.S.S.R. and its European
                                    satellities will not be transshipped to Communist China or be
                                    used to produce goods to be used against us in Korea. To avoid
                                    this danger the U.S. should bring under control all exports to
                                    the U.S.S.R. and its European satellites, and prevent the export
                                    to these countries of all commodities except those which have
                                    little or no strategic significance.</item>

                                <item>The military aggression by the Chinese Communists in Korea and
                                    the attitude taken toward this act by the U.S.S.R. and her
                                    European satellites indicate the possibility that military
                                    action by the European Soviet bloc countries might not be as
                                    distant as had been thought. In these circumstances the U.S.
                                    should not continue to ship to these countries commodities which
                                    would contribute even in small degree to their military
                                    potential. The prevention of such shipments can be accomplished
                                    much more promptly and effectively by extending the coverage of
                                    control to all commodities than by attempting to add commodities
                                    selectively to the list of controlled items. The process of
                                    selective addition is necessarily time consuming and fails to
                                    keep current with the development of new products.</item>

                                    proposals by the Office of International Trade for a tighter
                                    export control policy toward the Soviet Bloc were made on
                                    December 18, 1950. The Department of Commerce recommendations
                                    were supported in the January 10 meeting by the Departments of

                                    Provinces; and favored the denial, rather than presumption for

                                        <item>The Department of State considers the proposal to
                                            represent in effect an embargo on U.S. exports to the
                                            Soviet Bloc; and it believes that, though the program in
                                            actual operation might allow certain commodities to
                                            move, the action would be interpreted both in the United

                                        <item>The Department of State therefore believes that the
                                            proposals raise questions of foreign policy which

                                        <item>The State Department considers that present U.S. trade
                                            with the Soviet Bloc is of insignificant economic
                                            importance, while the political aspects of an embargo or
                                            a near embargo are of major significance. The State
                                            Department believes that, though the matter should be
                                            studied further before a final decision is made, the
                                            political disadvantages of an embargo move by the United
                                            States appear at present to outweigh the political

                                        <item>The political disadvantages of the recommendations, as
                                            seen by State, include the possibility of retaliation by
                                            the Soviet Bloc and injury to our relations with our
                                            Western Allies. The United States has told Western
                                            European countries, in negotiations on the export
                                            control problem, that it did not favor all-out economic
                                            warfare. An embargo would be interpreted in Western
                                            Europe to mean that the United States considers war
                                            inevitable, and that the United States will press for
                                            the adoption of Western European export control policies
                                            to the economic detriment of that area.</item>

                                    on a belief that export controls are at present adequately
                                    adjusted to the requirements of U.S.S.R.–U.S. relations, and
                                    that a selective approach to export control is more effective
                                    and meaningful than the blanket control of all commodities.

                                    evoke retaliatory measures by the Soviet Bloc against the U.S.,
                                    such retaliation would not damage the U.S. materially. Both the

                                    stimulus to the development of alternative sources of

                                <item>It is by no means certain that the proposed change would, as
                                    claimed, have adverse effects on our relation with Western
                                    European Allies. Since the inception of the security export
                                    control policy, the United States has exercised stricter control
                                    than Western European countries. This principle has been
                                    recognized in recent international negotiations on the problem.
                                    Further, at the time of the invasion of South Korea, the United
                                    States embargo against exports to North Korea assisted in
                                    bringing about the application of stricter control by Western
                                    European countries over their export to Communist China. These
                                    controls, as later evidence demonstrated, were vitally needed,
                                    and the example shows that leadership by the United States in
                                    this field has had results of positive value.</item>

                                    as an embargo is inaccurate. The recommendations leave the door

                                    satellites. Total U.S. exports to Soviet Eastern Europe in the
                                    first six months of 1950 amounted to $18, 900,000 of which
                                    $8,000,000 was raw cotton, which is now subject to control and
                                    would not be exported to that area. The remaining exports, at
                                    the rate of $21,800,000 a year were mainly in agricultural
                                    commodities (notably tobacco), miscellaneous industrial
                                    equipment, chemicals, and medicinals. Presumably the Negative
                                    List would include a number of the agricultural products,
                                    including tobacco, and medicinals, but would exclude the

                                embargo on trade with China. We wld wish to have <gloss

                                of economic sanctions by all other UN Members. We are aware that
                                certain European, Middle Eastern and Asian countries, notably India
                                and UK, will probably express strong objection to any effort impose
                                full embargo, on political as well as economic grounds. We are
                                therefore will to accept initially, in order preserve greatest
                                possible degree of free world unity, recommendation that Members
                                apply selective embargo on export to China of key items for use Chi
                                Red Army and directly serving Chi warmaking potential. These items

                                and commodities directly employed in production of munitions. Such a
                                selective embargo is in our view an indispensable and irreducible
                                minimum. It wld have comparatively little effect on the agrarian,
                                largely self-sufficient economy of bulk of civilian China, but wld
                                tend to hamper support and extension of Chi mil operations. It wld
                                not appreciably increase burden on Western European suppliers, or
                                cause them additional administrative difficulties. (<gloss

                                These controls are known only to US, Canada, UK, Fr, Denmark, Italy,

                            Korea in near future. It is important not to underestimate moral effect

                            in China, in rest of Sov bloc, or in outside world. Suggestions made in

                        <p>The Department has been requested by the Treasury Department to transmit
                            the following information. This information and the attached regulations
                            should serve as a basis both for answering inquiries and for reporting
                            to the Department any alleged violations of the regulations:</p>
                        <p>“Effective December 17, 1950, the Secretary of the Treasury, acting under
                            the authority of section 5 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of the Trading
                            with the Enemy Act, as amended, issued the Foreign Assets Control
                            Regulations, copies of which are transmitted herewith.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d249fn2">Not here printed.</note> These Regulations block
                            the United States assets of Communist China and North Korea and their
                            nationals, prohibiting all transactions involving such assets unless
                            Treasury Department licenses are obtained. The purpose of these controls
                            is to prevent financial transactions by or with these areas which would
                            be inimical to the interests of the United States.</p>
                        <p>“A series of general licenses was included as part of the Regulations
                            which authorize certain harmless transactions which would otherwise be
                            prohibited. Thus, individual Chinese and North Koreans in the United
                            States and also in non-Communist areas abroad (termed the Authorized
                            Trade Territory and defined in section 500.322 of the Regulations) will
                            be able to use their assets in the United States unless they are acting
                            on behalf of Communist China or North Korea, or have been in these
                            countries on or since December 17, 1950. Likewise, the assets of
                            business enterprises owned or controlled by such individuals are free
                            from these blocking restrictions if the only Chinese or North Korean
                            interest therein is that of such individuals. Among other general
                            licenses are those authorizing payments into blocked accounts and
                            authorizing payments out of such accounts for United States, state and
                            municipal taxes. Transactions not covered by general licenses may be
                            effected only under specific Treasury license. The Regulations provide
                            that applications for such specific licenses must be filed with the
                            Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on application forms obtainable from
                            that institution.</p>
                        <p>“Under the Regulations, remittances may be made to persons in <pb
                                n="1889" xml:id="pg_1889" facs="0431"/>China only in limited amounts
                            for living expenses and on condition that the dollar amount of the
                            remittance is credited to a blocked Chinese account in a United States
                            bank. Exceptions may be made by the Treasury Department in hardship or
                            other special cases.</p>
                        <p>“The Regulations permit imports from China and North Korea only if the
                            exporter is willing to accept blocked dollars in payment. It should be
                            noted that the Regulations are applicable to indirect importations from
                            China and North Korea as well as to direct importations from those
                            areas. Accordingly, a license is required in connection with any
                            importation through a third country, including countries contiguous to
                            the United States, if the merchandise being imported left China on or
                            after December 17, 1950, or if on or after that date a person in China
                            (except Formosa) or North Korea or a firm owned or controlled from those
                            areas or any other designated national had an interest in the
                            merchandise.</p>
                        <p>“The Regulations authorize payments from blocked accounts and other
                            transactions incident to exports from the United States to China and
                            North Korea provided the Department of Commerce issues an export license
                            under the Export Control Act of 1949. However, as a practical matter,
                            this authorization is inoperative because the Commerce Department’s
                            policy at present is not to license any exports to China or North Korea.
                            Furthermore, under the Regulations, dollars may not be used to finance
                            transactions between China or North Korea and third countries.</p>
                        <p>“It should be noted that the term ‘national’ as used in the Foreign
                            Assets Control Regulations is not restricted to citizens of China or
                            North Korea. As defined in the Regulations, the term ‘national’ includes
                            all persons resident in Communist China and North Korea, as well as the
                            governments thereof, and also persons acting for or on behalf of those
                            countries. This last definition is broad enough to include even American
                            citizens residing in the United States who are acting in a financial or
                            commercial capacity here for the benefit of Communist China or North
                            Korea. If the Foreign Assets Control is to be effective, it is essential
                            that the Treasury Department be able to identify and block the accounts
                            of persons acting commercially or financially as intermediaries or
                            cloaks for blocked nationals.”</p>
                        <p>Any information on violations, especially on cloaking activities in
                            behalf of Communist China or North Korea by persons in other countries
                            which might come to your attention should be reported promptly by
                            official informal letter marked for the attention of the Office of

                        <p>As reported in previous circular communications, in view of developments
                            in Korea, United States controls have been extended over all United
                            States exports to Mainland China, Manchuria, Hong Kong and Macao.
                            Regulations further require licensing of all goods of foreign origin
                            destined for above countries which move intransit through the United
                            States, or use foreign trade zones, or are manifested to the United
                            States. The latter regulation also applies to <hi rend="italic">Positive
                                List</hi> goods of foreign origin to Sub-Group A, (excluding China
                            and Manchuria). Pursuant to Defense Production Act of 1950, Commerce
                            Transportation Authority first prohibited United States flagships and
                            aircraft from transporting any Positive List commodity; any arms,
                            ammunition, or implements of war; or any commodity controlled under

                            Sub-Group A destination, Hong Kong or Macao. Subsequently, the latter
                            regulation was extended to prohibit United States flagships or aircraft
                            from going to any Chinese Communist port or from receiving or delivering
                            any cargo known or believed to be destined for Communist China.</p>
                        <p>In view of the emergency situation and increased United States controls,
                            it is desirable that the missions intensify attention to possible
                            transshipment of United States goods through your area. Also, it should
                            be noted that the foregoing regulations, particularly controls on
                            intransit shipments through the United States, may lead to creation of

                                    <hi rend="italic">Flying Cloud</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sir
                                    John Franklin</hi> were being offloaded at Bombay. Briefly,
                                these ships were transporting cargo, the delivery of which to
                                Communist China would have been inimical to the security interests
                                of the United States and in violation of the Department of Commerce
                                Transportation Order No. 2. The Isbrandtsen Company, alleging that
                                such action would facilitate the clearance of two ships then at Taku
                                Bar, obtained the approval of the State and Commerce Departments to
                                allow an exception to the Commerce Department order and permit
                                unloading at Bombay. When it became known that the ships at Taku Bar
                                were not jeopardized, and at your insistence by reason of the nature
                                of the cargoes, the off-loading authority was revoked. About 6,000
                                tons of the cargo had been unloaded.</item>

                                estimated time of arrival of 8 February, 1951. When first reports of
                                the <hi rend="italic">Hoi Houw</hi> loading were received, the
                                Department of State made representation to the Norwegian Government
                                requesting that action be taken to deny shipment by a Norwegian flag
                                vessel. The Norwegian Government subsequently reported to the
                                Department of State that it was their understanding that the <hi

                                Company of Hong Kong, who later chartered the vessel to the
                                Isbrandtsen Company. The Isbrandtsen Company, in turn, sub-chartered
                                it to the Bank of China, Bombay, for the lift in question. The
                                Department of State further advises that the Treasury Department
                                (Foreign Assets Control) has initiated an investigation of the
                                Isbrandtsen Company’s involvement in the transaction and the Consul
                                General in Bombay has been directed to investigate at that end. The
                                results of these investigations have not yet been received.</item>

                                DDT solution; and 45,000 lbs. aspirin and phenacetin). Recent
                                intelligence reports indicate that typhus is reaching epidemic
                                proportions among enemy units on the East coast and in the East
                                Central area of Korea. A typhus epidemic without specific
                                antibiotics and sulfa drugs for treatment will greatly reduce the
                                effectiveness of the Communist forces. It is not improbable that the

                                    Republic of China in Korea. For the full text of this

                                    In numbered paragraph 6 of the resolution, the Assembly
                                    requested “a Committee composed of the members of the Collective

                            Korea and ushers in new phase concerning which Dept’s present thinking
                            is summarized below.</p>
                        <p>2. In recent weeks US has contended strongly that continuance of Chi
                            Commie intervention despite reptd efforts for cease-fire required UN to
                            reach conclusion that Chi Commies were engaged in aggression. We
                            believed this was essential if UN effort in Korea were not <pb n="1894"
                                xml:id="pg_1894" facs="0436"/>to become a tragic waste and if
                            usefulness of UN itself were not to be virtually destroyed in security
                            field.</p>
                        <p>3. Now that UN has taken decision to face up to fact of Chi Commie
                            aggression, we desire in working out next steps to make every effort to
                            maintain and enhance willing cooperation of peace-loving majority of UN
                            Members. In particular, we shld stress our continued willingness to
                            negotiate peaceful settlement of Korean conflict on basis UN principles
                            and shld seek to convince our friends that our policies are based upon a
                            desire to prevent extension of hostilities in <gloss target="#t_FE1"
                                >FE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. We are not in position at this time to know whether it will be
                            possible to stabilize military operations around 38th parallel and to
                            look forward to an acceptable cease-fire and some relaxation, through
                            efforts of Good Office Comite, of <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            tensions. Great care shld be exercised to see that if this possibility
                            exists, nothing is done at UN or elsewhere to destroy it.</p>
                        <p>5. In light these considerations, fol factors wld be important in our

                                    Members can agree apply selective embargo than if fewer Members,

                                    embargo. It is therefore important to concert our views with

                            set forth <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 685. British
                            initially revealed slight attitude suspicion that we might be wishing to
                            force pace but this feeling we allayed without difficulty. General tone
                            discussion was very cooperative and we feel laid basis for avoiding any
                            serious differences while developing mutually acceptable program on
                            basis close consultation.</p>
                        <p>Re military sanctions (paragraph 1, <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                >Deptel</gloss> 643), there was no difference of view.</p>
                        <p>Re economic sanctions (paragraph 2, <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss>) Jebb and Coulson personally did not appear to see
                            any great difficulties so far as British themselves were concerned of
                            selective embargo based as minimum on export controls already being
                            applied by governments participating in control of trade with Soviet
                            bloc. They were not, however, for moment in position to speak for <gloss
                                target="#t_UKG1">UKG</gloss>. In general, they raised question
                            extent to which even such selective embargo might be expected to rally
                            support of large majority of Assembly. We ventured no dogmatic
                            prediction on this point but expressed confidence that once mutually
                            acceptable program worked out with British it seemed reasonable to
                            suppose that through out joint efforts satisfactory majority support of
                            Assembly could be achieved. In particular Jebb expressed some curiosity
                            re our views on specific items. We indicated our understanding
                            Department was studying whole matter broadly but we did not yet have
                            detailed instructions on specific items.</p>
                        <p>Re political sanctions (paragraph 3, <gloss target="#t_reftel1"
                                >reftel</gloss>), British were noncommittal to points reviewed by
                            Gross. They dismissed their position in Postal Union on grounds this is
                            purely technical body. We had <pb n="1896" xml:id="pg_1896" facs="0438"
                            />impression differences of principle might more readily arise in this
                            area than in economic or military areas.</p>
                        <p>We achieved very close community of views re election of officers and
                            committee procedure in initial stages. Without particularly urging our
                            own views, British very readily fell in with idea of electing Muniz<note

                                rend="italic">rapporteur</hi>. … We outlined our thinking that when
                            committee meets, presumably next week, purpose should be not to get
                            involved in discussion and debate but to proceed immediately to election
                            of officers who would be requested by committee with assistance of
                            secretariat to work out and report plan of work to committee. We had in
                            mind that we and British would develop our ideas on such work plan which
                            would be communicated to friendly and wholly trustworthy bureau. In this
                            way, neither we nor British would be under necessity of putting forward
                            and staking our prestige to any particular plan. It was our concept
                            further that following approval of work plan by committee, bureau would
                            again proceed with assistance of secretariat in development of studies
                            contemplated by work plan. In this later stage, we would also in close
                            consultation and cooperation with British assist the bureau.</p>
                        <p>Jebb raised question of consultation with French and we agreed with him,
                            of course, that we would through this process wish to work in very close
                            consultation with French as with British.</p>
                        <p>During course of discussion, Gross took occasion to make clear to Jebb
                            that Department, including Secretary, thought his explanation of vote on
                            US resolution in Assembly was not well calculated to develop program on
                            cooperative basis we all wanted. Jebb said he had had commendatory
                            telegram from Foreign Office. He also said that he did not mean nor had
                            he said that <hi rend="italic">Ad Hoc</hi> Committee should delay
                            consideration of additional measures but he thought he had indicated
                            clearly his feeling that the “Assembly” should not at this time consider
                            additional measures.</p>

                            As in ease of British, no important differences emerged in this
                            discussion. General attitude of Parodi in particular was similar to that
                            of British in sense of wanting to move slowly and on fully consultative
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>Parodi agreed with suggestion made by Chauvel that <hi rend="italic">Ad

                            not consider political sanctions since they did not involve “technical”

                        <p>On Friday, February 2, Mr. Merchant put the British Embassy on notice
                            that we hoped that they could cooperate in frustrating delivery of the

                                (not printed) addressed to Mr. O. Edmund Clubb, Director of the
                                Office of Chinese Affairs, Mr. Merchant suggested that in view of
                                the great importance the Department of State attached to stopping
                                the import by Mainland China of any medicines useful in treating
                                typhus, the Department of Commerce take advantage of Mr. Clarke’s
                                presence in Washington to discuss the problem. A handwritten note on
                                this memorandum by Mr. Clubb, also dated February 9, read as
                                follows: “L[ivingston] T. M[erchant] &amp; I agree that it would be
                                impolitic to act in a way which would attract undue attention to

                            military aspect as set forth in Secretary Matthews’ memorandum of
                            February 2, was put to the British fully and frankly.<note n="5"

                            that they had little leverage in the operation since the owner of the
                            cargo was the Chinese Communist Bank of China, the cargo itself of
                            United States origin, and ship of Norwegian registry. We explored
                            various methods by which the British might frustrate delivery, bearing
                            in mind that only if the <hi rend="italic">Hoi Houw</hi> enters British
                            territorial waters at Singapore or Hong Kong will the British be in a
                            position to apply pressure at all. The British Embassy has referred to
                            London for urgent consideration the question of what steps can be taken
                            if the ship enters British jurisdiction.</p>

                        <p>Following our talk with the British, we concluded that the most practical
                            way of preventing the cargoes reaching the Chinese Communists was to
                            have them off-loaded in Japan. In consequence, prior to talking with the
                            Norwegians, who were best able to cooperate in this project, we obtained
                            from Admiral Thach of the Navy Department a firm assurance that if the
                                <hi rend="italic">Hoi Houw</hi> could be diverted to a Japanese port
                            authorities in Japan would be prepared to off-load the cargoes and make
                            compensation to their owner.<note n="6" xml:id="d254fn6">Attached
                                memorandum of this conversation of February 3 between Mr. Barnett
                                and Adm. James H. Thach, Jr., not printed.</note> Admiral Thach said
                            that the Department of Defense, unfortunately, could not undertake to
                            indemnify the Norwegian master or owner for possible court costs. We
                            informed him that this meant that those costs would be borne by the
                            Norwegians, if they arose, and that this fact might cause them to refuse
                            to take the action we desire, particularly since there are other
                            considerations which could make them reluctant to cooperate. For
                            example, there is little doubt that failure of the Norwegian master to
                            take the <hi rend="italic">Hoi Houw</hi>, as contracted, to Hong Kong
                            would invite litigation which, if unsatisfactory, would expose the
                            twenty-five odd Norwegian vessels still in the China trade to reprisal
                            threats. Admiral Thach undertook to bring to the attention of Secretary
                            Matthews the restriction upon use of the diplomatic channel which our
                            inability to assure indemnification presented.</p>
                        <p>Having reached these preliminary understandings with Admiral Thach, we
                            called in a representative of the Norwegian Embassy on Saturday
                                afternoon<note n="7" xml:id="d254fn7">Attached memorandum of

                            previously discussed with the British, suggesting, this time, that the
                            Norwegian Government despatch an instruction to the Norwegian ship
                            master to put in at a Japanese port. We gave assurance that authorities
                            in Japan would unload and pay for the cargo. The Norwegian Embassy has
                            undertaken to communicate our request to Oslo at once for urgent reply.
                            The initial reaction of the Embassy representative was that it was
                            unlikely that Oslo could take the action so desired, unless full
                            indemnification of the ship owner could be assured.</p>

                        <p>I think I should add that the possibility of involvement by the
                            Isbrandtsen Company in the on-shipment from Bombay has been investigated
                            by the Treasury Department which has informed us that its inquiry showed
                            no evidence of involvement and that Mr. Isbrandtsen<note n="8"

                        <p>The British Embassy has presented an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                            to the Department in which it is recommended that the United States give
                            urgent consideration to a licensing policy proposed by the British for
                            United States exports to Hong Kong. Assurances have been given by the
                            British that the Government of Hong Kong has instituted all measures of
                            export control and supervision of domestic uses of commodities that it
                            considers feasible to guard against the transshipment of United States
                            exports through Hong Kong to Communist China either before or after
                            fabrication in Hong Kong. The <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> points
                            out, however, that this control cannot be made completely water-tight
                            due to the peculiar economy of Hong Kong. The problem is to determine
                            whether, in the light of the assurances given by the British and in view
                            of the importance attached by the British to the continued existence of
                            Hong Kong without undue economic dislocation as part of the Free World,
                            the Department’s policy should be to establish a liberal, automatic
                            licensing procedure which would assure the fulfillment of Hong Kong’s
                            legitimate needs from the United States.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>On December 16, 1950, the United States Government announced extensive
                            controls over the economic relationships between the United States and
                            Communist China. These controls are intended to deprive Communst China
                            of access to United States goods and to financial resources within
                            United States jurisdiction in view of the commitment of Chinese
                            resources in the unprovoked aggressive activities in Korea of the
                            Chinese Communist regime.</p>
                        <p>Because of the geographic position of Hong Kong and Macao it was felt
                            necessary to include these two Governments within the regulations
                            established for control of trade to China. These regulations required
                            that licenses be obtained for all shipments to these areas. The
                            administrative decision to deny all license applications, however, was
                            not applied to Hong Kong and Macao. When the system of controls was
                            announced it immediately caused concern in Hong Kong since the British

                            endangered. The Government of Hong Kong immediately informed the United

                            concern.</p>
                        <p>Immediately thereafter several discussions were held in the Advisory
                            Committee on Export Policy concerning the licensing policy which should
                            be applied to United States exports to Hong Kong. Under the interim
                            licensing policy (attached as Annex A) which was established January 5,
                            Department of Commerce has been approving a very limited number of
                            licenses for the export of commodities from this country to Hong
                                Kong.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">See circular telegram 393, January
                                17, <ref target="#pg_1877">p. 1877</ref>.</note> It was recognized,
                            in a meeting of State Department and Commerce Department officials with
                            representatives of the British Embassy, that an attempt should be made
                            to obtain import requirements data and such assurances of effective
                            controls over transshipments from the Governments of the United Kingdom
                            and Hong Kong as would permit a liberal and largely automatic licensing
                            policy to be pursued by the Department of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>Further discussions have been carried on between officers of the
                            Department and representatives of the British Embassy, including a
                            representative of the Hong Kong Government, in order to ascertain the
                            most feasible export licensing policy to be pursued in the case of Hong
                            Kong. On February 1, 1951, representatives of the British Embassy
                            submitted an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> (attached as Annex B)
                            which proposed that a substantially automatic licensing policy should be
                            followed. In order to achieve such an automatic policy, the British and
                            the Hong Kong Governments have given assurances to the United States
                            that goods imported from the United States into Hong Kong will not be
                            exported to China either in their original form or as the sole or
                            substantial constituent of goods fabricated in Hong Kong. The British
                            have proposed that all Positive List commodities for export to Hong Kong
                            should be considered on a case by case basis by the Department of
                            Commerce and that non-Positive List commodities should be automatically
                            licensed up to 75 percent of overall imports by Hong Kong in 1949. This
                            is roughly equal to the overall percentage of Hong Kong imports in 1949
                            which was consumed locally or shipped to destinations other than
                            Communist China.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Discussion:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The British have openly and frankly stated in their <hi rend="italic"
                                >aide-mémoire</hi> that the procedure which they have suggested will
                            not be a watertight control which will completely prevent U.S. imports
                            into Hong Kong from reaching China in one form or another. They have
                            stated, however, that it is their belief that the proposed procedure
                            will prevent transshipment and minimize exports to China from Hong Kong
                            of fabricated goods containing United States materials.</p>
                        <pb n="1901" xml:id="pg_1901" facs="0443"/>
                        <p>It has been generally agreed by the several interested agencies of the
                            United States Government that it is necessary to maintain an effective
                            control over all exports to China from the United States. Since the
                            Department of Commerce is charged with the responsibility of
                            administering such controls, it is particularly sensitive to
                            Congressional and public criticism of any shipment of materials directly
                            or indirectly to China from the United States. It may be anticipated,
                            therefore, that the Department of Commerce will be concerned over the
                            possibility that any U.S. goods will be transshipped, directly or
                            indirectly, from Hong Kong. It might be further anticipated that the
                            Department of Commerce will tend to reject any proposal, such as that
                            made by the British, which admits of such a possibility.</p>
                        <p>However, it would appear that the Department of State should be prepared
                            to support the British proposal in the interest of good relations with
                            our chief ally and in the general interest of the United States. Since
                            the British have indicated that they are very concerned about the
                            economic repercussions which would be caused by the drying up of
                            essential imports into Hong Kong from the United States, it would seem
                            necessary for the United States, in the interest of the security of Hong
                            Kong, to take the risk that some small amount of U.S. exports will be
                            transshipped to China or enter into the fabrication of materials which
                            are shipped to China.</p>
                        <p>Hong Kong is important to both the United States and the United Kingdom
                            since it is a symbol of the strength and the stability of the British
                            Empire throughout all Asia. The loss of Hong Kong would remove one of
                            our most important sources of intelligence in the Far East. Its loss to
                            Communist arms would have a psychological effect not unlike the reverses
                            of the United Nations military forces in North Korea. Its loss to the
                            Communists from internal subversion resulting from economic dislocations
                            known to have been produced by United States export controls would be
                            taken in Asia and probably in Europe as an indication of the dissension
                            among the friendly members of the Free World.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Recent developments
                                in the international situation require that the United States review
                                and adjust certain of its policies and programs with respect to its
                                international economic activities. It is necessary that we now take
                                such measures as are feasible to prevent the flow to countries
                                supporting Communist imperialist aggression of those materials,
                                goods, funds and services which would serve materially to aid their
                                ability to carry on such aggression. We must enlist the cooperation
                                and support of other nations in carrying out those measures; and in
                                securing such support we must stand ready to take such steps as may
                                be necessary to minimize the economic dependency <pb n="1904"
                                    xml:id="pg_1904" facs="0446"/>of cooperating nations upon
                                Communist imperialist countries. Such objectives must necessarily be
                                achieved without materially impairing our collateral aim of
                                increasing the flow, and assuring the sound allocation, of strategic
                                and critical materials to the free countries of the world.</p>
                            <p>It is my desire that to the extent that legislation, organization and
                                funds permit and subject to your advice and concurrence with respect
                                to foreign policy objectives, all appropriate programs of the
                                Government now be adjusted and hereafter administered in the light
                                of the above determinations. I desire that you keep me currently
                                informed of the actions taken by the various agencies involved in
                                support of these objectives.</p>
                            <p>Further, I request that you take the lead in developing
                                recommendations, for submission to me within the next 30 days, of
                                additional measures to achieve these purposes. The development of
                                recommendations will require an analysis to be undertaken by the
                                Economic Cooperation Administration, with such assistance from other
                                agencies as it may request, of the economy and trade of Communist
                                imperialist aggressors as well as the economy and trade of countries
                                trading with them and the development of specific programs for the
                                adjustment of those trade patterns.</p>
                            <p>I am having copies of this letter transmitted to the Secretaries of
                                Defense, Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce and Interior, to the

                                you may require.</p>

                            <p>The report contains a series of substantive recommendations for
                                immediate action to strengthen our own controls and those of
                                friendly countries. It also recommends further exploration of a
                                number of lines of action which there has not yet been time to
                                consider fully.</p>
                            <p>As activities in this field require constant review and consideration
                                and as the possible lines of action are of interest to several
                                departments and agencies of the Executive branch, it is also
                                recommended that an interdepartmental Economic Defense Strategy
                                Board be established for the purpose, among others, of considering
                                proposed economic defense programs and their relationships to
                                foreign policy objectives and other foreign operations. If you
                                concur in this recommendation, it would be desirable for this Board
                                to be established promptly.</p>
                            <p>Pending the establishment of any new mechanism, I suggest that the
                                report be considered by the National Security Council. I believe
                                this particularly desirable as certain aspects of this subject are
                                already before the Council.</p>
                            <p>The pressure of time has made it impracticable for us to seek and
                                obtain final approval of the report from the other departments and
                                agencies interested in this subject. We did, however, seek their
                                comments and suggestions on our preliminary draft and have
                                endeavored to reflect their views. We have also had the benefits of
                                the views of the Bureau of the Budget and of Mr. Harriman’s office
                                in the development of the recommendations.</p>

                            <p>It is not possible to make final recommendations covering the entire
                                subject under review without further study and consultation with
                                other agencies of the Government. However, the following
                                recommendations are submitted with a view to setting a pattern for
                                immediate action and establishing machinery for carrying forward the
                                consideration and development of policies and programs. Because of

                                Government in this subject, and because some aspects of it have been
                                before the National Security Council, it is suggested that these
                                recommendations be referred to the Council for review and
                                consideration by it and other appropriate departments and
                                agencies.</p>

                                U.N., continue to prohibit all exports to communist China, Manchuria
                                and North Korea, but should apply licensing controls so as to permit
                                Hong Kong and Macao to procure from U.S. sources imports for local
                                uses and for transshipment to non-communist destinations.</p>

                            <p>7. The U.S. Government, in view of the Chinese Communist aggression
                                in Korea, should press for the application of effective controls on
                                exports to China. Its efforts through the United Nations should be
                                directed at achieving agreement on economic sanctions by the maximum
                                number of countries; if necessary to achieve a wide measure of
                                agreement, such sanctions may be confined to a list of goods

                            <p>Because of the difference in the military situation and because of
                                the peculiarities of the Chinese economy, the US has adopted a
                                policy of trade controls towards China which differs substantially
                                from our trade controls towards the European Soviet Bloc. In
                                contrast with our policy of selective controls towards exports to
                                the European Soviet Bloc, we have placed a virtual embargo on all
                                trade (export and import) and financial transactions with China.</p>
                            <p>Western Europe and the United Kingdom have gone along with us only a
                                short way in this policy, and the raw material producing areas of
                                the world have done little or nothing. The Western industrial world
                                is, however, a major factor in China’s import position and our
                                policy has therefore already had measurable effects on China’s
                                imports.</p>
                            <pb n="1908" xml:id="pg_1908" facs="0450"/>
                            <p>In adopting this policy we should recognize clearly that we can do
                                relatively little economic damage to the great Chinese area through
                                general trade controls. China is one of the most self-sufficient
                                areas in the world in the purely technical sense that it imports
                                only a minute part of its aggregate requirements. The real meaning
                                of this technical definition is that China normally has relatively
                                little to sell to the outside world for the purpose of financing
                                needed import supplies, and it therefore follows that it would be
                                difficult to disrupt the internal economy by diverting the import
                                stream. Furthermore, the great resources of China are manpower,
                                animal power and land. The employment of these resources cannot
                                generally be disturbed by the denial of outside supplies.</p>
                            <p>To the extent, however, that China can be hurt through the blocking
                                of certain imports, she is today vulnerable and, in the event of a
                                formal blockade, would be in a critical position in respect to these
                                important imports. Most of China’s imports are recorded or smuggled
                                through her own, British and Portuguese ports along the coast of the
                                Yellow Sea and the China Sea. Internal Asiastic lines of
                                communication are bad and the goods available along these lines are
                                not the type most needed by China. Furthermore, China obtains most
                                or practically all of its machinery, steel, oil and other items
                                essential to the modern sector of its economy from the US, Canada,
                                Western Europe and Japan, or, as in the case of oil, through
                                supplies controlled by US and British companies. These supplying
                                areas are the ones most responsive to US policy objectives. In the
                                balance of the free world only South Asia and Southeast Asia are
                                important as suppliers to China. While many of the supplies China
                                receives from these areas are “essential” in a technical sense, they
                                could in a pinch be done without.</p>

                                        the non-Soviet Bloc. The British and American oil embargo
                                        against China has to date been effective in curtailing
                                        China’s oil supplies, but we must recognize that the Chinese
                                        economy and even the Chinese military establishment are not
                                        greatly dependent upon petroleum products.</item>

                                        should shift to the south. In that event the necessity of
                                        moving oil and heavy equipment (particularly from Manchuria)
                                        would probably place a serious burden on China’s rail system
                                        and, perhaps, an intolerable burden if the coaster traffic
                                        were disrupted. Chinese purchasing agents have been
                                        aggressively seeking rail supplies throughout the world and,

                                    <item>The technological sector of China, while unimportant in
                                        aggregate terms in the area’s massive economy, is important
                                        for political and psychological reasons as well as for
                                        longer-range economic reasons. Backed by a slim reserve of
                                        replacements, spare parts and technical know-how, this
                                        sector is heavily dependent upon a sustained inflow of new
                                        equipment. Worthy of note in this connection is the fact
                                        that selective export controls against the Chinese
                                        technological sector are less meaningful than the same
                                        selective type of controls against the Soviet Bloc in Europe
                                        because of the wide range and general character of the
                                        machinery required by China. As normally the largest
                                        supplier of this equipment to China, our unilateral embargo
                                        has become effective, but shipments from other industrial
                                        areas of the free world appear to be moving towards postwar
                                        peak levels.</item>

                                        “essential” in any analysis of China’s import program. China
                                        has, however, recently made such abnormally large purchases
                                        of crude rubber that it can probably continue for a long
                                        time without additional supplies and, in any event, crude
                                        rubber can be done without in China, assuming that tires
                                        continue to come from outside sources. Cotton imports are
                                        important primarily in their essentiality in keeping the
                                        country’s big textile industry in operation. This commodity
                                        can, however, be procured from so many sources throughout
                                        the world that we would have to embark on a major political
                                        and economic program if we seriously attempted to seal China
                                        off from the cotton production of the world.</item>

                            <p>The US and Western Europe, although accounting for a large part of
                                China’s total exports, are not critically dependent upon China for
                                supplies. Lists of “essential” items which we receive from China are
                                “essential” to us only in the sense that the Chinese product will do
                                a better job than a satisfactory substitute. Tungsten is the major
                                exception to this rule, and it would be highly important to us if
                                Chinese supplies should continue to arrive.</p>
                            <p>In over-all economic terms our trade policies of today are not
                                costing China a great deal. In this report we have made a rough
                                guess that the cost to China of obtaining substitute material and
                                the cost in terms of resources rendered idle by our embargo might be
                                of the magnitude of $75 million a year. A part of this cost stems
                                from the fact that certain by-products of the Chinese farming
                                operation, such as duck feathers, lose some or most of their value
                                in the absence of an American market. In judging the aggregate
                                economic cost to China we must bear in mind that, because of the
                                nature of our embargo, the cost is spread thinly over a major part
                                of the population. About the <pb n="1910" xml:id="pg_1910"
                                    facs="0452"/>best that can be said for our policy in striking an
                                Economic balance is that the free world, and the US in particular,
                                do not suffer in a measurable sense.</p>
                            <p>The one major geographic exception to this general rule of
                                invulnerability of the non-Communist world to an embargo on China is
                                Japan. We have made an estimate that, because of the loss of Chinese
                                sources for vital imports (primarily soy beans, coking coal and iron
                                ore) the economic cost to Japan of obtaining alternative supplies
                                will run about $10 million per annum. These alternative supplies
                                must, however, come primarily from the US and, unless Japan’s normal
                                exports to China can be diverted to this country with the possible
                                aid of a liberalization of our trade policy, the cost to Japan of
                                the loss of Chinese supplies may be several times greater than the
                                calculated incremental cost of substituted imports. The realignment
                                of Japan’s trade relations is a problem of the first magnitude.</p>
                            <p>In the final analysis, however, the real criteria for judging the
                                balance of advantages and disadvantages in our trade war on China
                                are not economic. They are military, psychological and, above all,
                                political. Because of the way the Chinese army fights, we should not
                                be too optimistic about the military effects of our policy, but if
                                China plans to become aggressive in more than one spot around its
                                periphery, its complicated transportation and oil problem will have
                                to be taken into account. Politically it is also important that we
                                have in effect announced to the free world and to the Chinese people
                                that we are imposing a quarantine against them in their contact with
                                a large part of the modern technological world. Since the effects of
                                this announcement are not economic, they have not been analyzed in
                                this report.</p>
                            <p>Because our operations against the Chinese have gone so far, we have
                                wound up the Chinese section of this report with a set of six

                                is far more important from a military-economic point of view to
                                tighten controls against Eastern Europe than against China.
                                Furthermore, the wisdom of embarking upon negotiations of this kind

                                    diplomatic sanctions would be useless or counter-productive, we
                                    expressed the view that diplomatic measures of some sort are a
                                    logical consequence of the declaration of the Chinese Communists
                                    as aggressors and are desirable both to register the moral
                                    condemnation of their continuance of the aggression as a warning
                                    that they cannot expect full membership in the international
                                    community so long as they continue their present course, and
                                    that, coupled with economic measures and the continuance of
                                    military action in Korea, diplomatic measures should help induce
                                    a modification of Chinese Communists attitude and deter possible

                                    discussion failed to produce agreement on these points. The UK
                                    representatives expressed the view that, regardless of the
                                    theoretical appropriateness of such measures, the consequences
                                    would be harmful, both in terms of the reaction of the Chinese
                                    Communists themselves in driving them into the arms of Moscow
                                    and of the attitude of a number of Asian countries. The latter
                                    regard US action in Formosa as only somewhat less reprehensible
                                    aggression than Chinese action in Korea since in the Asian view
                                    the US has interfered militarily in a civil war in order to
                                    defend a losing regime which we ourselves had publicly
                                    acknowledged as discredited and bankrupt. Such diplomatic
                                    measures against the Peiping Government as a ban on seating and
                                    on further recognition would be <pb n="1913" xml:id="pg_1913"
                                        facs="0455"/>seen as a further effort to shore up
                                    diplomatically the fallen Nationalist regime. We pointed out
                                    that refusal to seat the Communists in the UN until they have,
                                    so to speak, purged themselves of their contempt is not so much
                                    a retributive sanction as the minimum necessary concomitant of
                                    recognizing their aggression against the UN. We suggested that
                                    if, as seems clear, the necessary majority for seating them will
                                    not be forthcoming in any event there could be no harm in this
                                    decision being formalized. The UK representatives observed,
                                    however, that, just as with UN action regarding Spain, formal
                                    decisions of such nature make more difficult any subsequent
                                    modification or reversal at some future time. This they felt
                                    highly undesirable. It was recognized on the other hand that if
                                    any <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> decision barring seating
                                    were to be qualified by the phrase “so long as their aggression
                                    continues” this might be some encouragement that in the future
                                    repentance would bring admission. We referred to the greater
                                    effect on the Chinese Government and people of a formal
                                    declaration by the UN than a simple <hi rend="italic">de

                                <item>In summary, it was recognized that the wisdom of such
                                    diplomatic steps depend on a balance of the above factors and
                                    that our differences of view arise from the differing degrees of

                            China</p>
                        <p>Attached is the recommended US position on this subject as it has been
                            developed by a working group with <gloss target="#t_BNA1">BNA</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss> participation, modified slightly
                            to counter Treasury and Commerce insistence on having the US propose
                            what would amount to a total embargo. The Treasury Department also
                            desires to have the whole matter thoroughly explored by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>. Informal efforts are being made to
                            obtain Treasury and Commerce acquiescence to the more limited approach
                            of the attached, and to avoid the necessity of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> consideration. It may, however, be necessary to have
                            high level talks with at least Treasury representatives, since their
                            general approach seems to be, by urging virtually complete embargo,
                            either to put the State Department on the spot for refusing to have the
                            US propose this in the UN or to have the US propose it and place the
                            onus of rejecting it on the UK and our other Allies.</p>

                        <p>I have two comments on the draft position paper of February 12 relative
                            to economic sanctions against Communist China. The first of these, which
                            I mentioned to you yesterday, is that as a matter of both tactics and,
                            even more important, support of this Government’s position, the United
                            States representative on the Committee should state the U.S. desire that
                            all UN members should totally embargo trade with China. This statement I
                            think should be followed, in the interest of the realities, by a clear
                            indication that we are not going to stubbornly hold out for extreme
                            action and should concentrate on obtaining as wide an area of general
                            agreement as possible. This point is more one of tactics and
                            presentation than substance.</p>
                        <p>My second point, however, I fear is more difficult to meet. I don’t see
                            how as a practical matter we can escape having the Committee formulate
                            the list of prohibited items. If each country is allowed to make up its
                            own list, it seems to me that the result in practice will be that no
                            country (except the United States) will embargo more items than appear
                            on the smallest list of the least enthusiastic member. The alternative
                            to this course I realize is unattractive but I think less so than the
                            course proposed.</p>

                            as consistent with careful work by Comite and opportunity for its
                            members consult their Govts. Work of Comite and schedule of meetings
                            will inevitably be influenced by military developments in Korea and

                            <hi rend="italic">b</hi>. As general rule, Comite shld meet as whole. If
                            it appears particular questions can better be considered by sub-Comite,
                            such sub-Comite, preferably sub-Comite of whole, shld be created for
                            purpose. It may be desirable, for example, create sub-Comite on economic
                            measures to consider desirability, practicability and effect of proposed
                            economic measures against Chi. It may also prove desirable create small
                            drafting groups from time to time.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. Comite shld meet privately and treat all
                            proceedings confidential. From time to time may, if considers
                            appropriate, prepare press communiqués on meetings, or press releases on
                            progress it is making.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Comite shld adopt at second meeting gen
                            outline of work. Under each part of agenda, members will of course state
                            views and may also propose additional items for Comite’s consideration.
                            In view delicate nature of work of Comite, it does not appear desirable
                            have draft proposals prepared by Secretariat. Secretariat will be used
                            for aiding members in drafting proposals or for drafting on matters on
                            which Comite has reached agreement in principle. It may also be utilized
                            for preparation historical or purely technical studies.</p>

                            <item>It is proposed that Comite begin by consideration economic

                                agreement on such measures and Comite can make better progress by
                                beginning with them. Also in view of ramifications of such measures,
                                more time will be necessary for full study. If it is decided to
                                create sub-Comite for subject, sub-Comite will be able begin work

                                insignificance of the economies in these areas; however, it is
                                assumed that economic warfare measures will also apply against these

                            this paper. The absence of military operations is assumed as a part of
                            the terms of reference.</p>
                        <p>Since China is engaged in military operations against United Nations
                            forces in Korea, it is necessary to assess the effect of economic
                            warfare upon China under the existing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The measures considered available to the Western Powers to deny exports
                            to the Soviet bloc include the following: export and import licensing,
                            trade manipulation, preclusive buying, black listing, foreign funds
                            control, and the denial to the Soviet bloc of access to non-Soviet
                            maritime and air facilities. The effects of blockade and of the use of
                            the navicert and ship warrant systems are not considered in this paper
                            under the term economic warfare since these measures are usually not
                            employed except in a state of war.</p>

                        <p>6. The effect of a program of economic warfare against China requires
                            special consideration since China is actually engaged in military
                            operations of major importance. The effect of economic warfare alone
                            would not be a decisive factor in limiting Chinese military
                            capabilities. Combined with the present drain caused by the Korean war,
                            however, economic warfare would substantially reduce Chinese military
                            capabilities (though not to the extent of critically disrupting current
                            tactical operations) and might ultimately affect the Korean war itself.
                            Unless the Soviet Union were engaged in supplying major campaigns
                            elsewhere, it would have the capability, despite certain stringencies in
                            its economy, of supplying China’s essential military requirements, but
                            it is uncertain how much the flow of Soviet supplies to China could be
                            stepped up without creating critical transportation difficulties. The
                                <pb n="1921" xml:id="pg_1921" facs="0463"/>effect of these
                            difficulties together with the drain caused by the Korean war might,
                            conditioned upon the degree of resistance, exert a restraining influence
                            upon Chinese plans for further expansion in Southeast Asia or might
                            significantly hamper the execution of such plans if they were put into
                            operation.</p>

                        <p>7. The industrial centers of China which are largely the product of
                            Western capitalism are peculiarly dependent upon the West for raw
                            materials, for supplies, and for industrial spare parts, and, indeed,
                            even for the maintenance of some of the barest essentials of an
                            industrial type of society. A program of economic warfare, by depriving
                            these centers of their imports, would consequently have a serious effect
                            on their economy and would increase the problems of internal control
                            there. In addition, a well enforced program of economic warfare would
                            make Communist China more dependent on the very limited Chinese rail
                            facilities connecting with the USSR. Such a program would have
                            increasingly serious effects. It would hamper current industrial
                            production, retard industrial development and might seriously limit
                            China’s ability to sustain large-scale military operations. If continued
                            for a long enough time, it might even threaten the internal stability of
                            the regime.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> this language in plan of work will
                            enable Comite to discuss whole range of possible trade limitations,
                            including complete and selective embargoes, and, if Comite decides it is
                            appropriate, to review categories of items which might fall within
                            various types of embargoes. It is a flexible formula which enables both
                            US and UK to retain full freedom of action. Further, it will avoid
                            adverse reaction which might be expected, particularly from US public
                            opinion, if Comite began with discussion complete embargo and rejected
                            this idea, as wld certainly be case since it wld obviously be impossible
                            reach agreement with UK, as well as other dels on complete embargo.
                            Suggested approach will also lead into consideration of type of general
                            formula for selective embargo which US now intends to propose at
                            appropriate time. General wording of basic question re nature of
                            economic sanctions to be applied will not preclude US, in presenting own
                            position, from referring to total embargo which US now applying against
                            China as most effective step which can be taken, from recognizing
                            difficulties which other Members find in adopting same position, and
                            from consequently agreeing to selective embargo as most UN wld wish to
                            undertake in present circumstances.</p>

                        <p>At the outset of the meeting Mr. Meade outlined UK views on the following
                            aspects of the problem of economic sanctions, stressing that they were
                            informal and had not yet received Cabinet approval.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Full Embargo</hi>. By this the UK understood to
                                mean the export prohibition on all goods and commodities imposed at
                                the source. They expressed the hope that this idea would be
                                discarded at the earliest possible stage. In the UK view, it would
                                be unrealistic to expect the support of all major countries
                                (mentioning specifically India, Burma and Pakistan as probable
                                dissenters) and they felt that even if all countries did participate
                                it would not achieve the objective since China is not seriously
                                dependent on sea-borne imports. Thus, a full embargo would not alter
                                the course of military operations in Korea, nor deflect the Chinese
                                from further aggressive operations elsewhere. The British Combined
                                Chiefs see the gravest political and military consequences and
                                possible retaliation by the Chinese Communists to any effort to
                                impose and enforce a full embargo.</item>

                                not be effective without the cooperation of all Members which,
                                again, it would be almost impossible to obtain, and they were
                                fearful that the effort to impose such controls would result in
                                greater harm to the UN Members than damage to the Chinese
                                Communists. They pointed out that, for example, the imposition of
                                such controls would undoubtedly result in large scale defections of
                                Chinese sailors from the Dutch and British merchant fleets. This
                                would seriously cripple shipping operations generally, and the
                                probable attitude of India and Pakistan would make difficult the
                                recruitment of their nationals as replacements.</item>

                                to impose a full embargo ourselves and gave the rationale for it
                                along the following lines: <list>
                                    <item>Since the autumn of 1949 when Communist authority began to
                                        replace that of the National Government there have been
                                        present within the United States Government two opposed
                                        theories which were thought could govern our trade relations
                                        with Communist China. One was that maintenance of trade
                                        relations represented “a foot in the door” to be exploited,
                                        if possible, as a means for influencing Communist China to
                                        loosen its ties with the Kremlin and seek some reasonable
                                            <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi> with the countries
                                        which had the most to offer and most to gain from mutually
                                        advantageous economic relations. The other theory was that
                                        Communist China should be penalized, by economic means, for
                                        its declared hostility to the West—and particularly the
                                        United States—should be deprived of goods which contributed
                                        to the success of a regime engaged in programs of internal
                                        political repression and foreign aggression. The policy
                                        actually adopted by the United States from the autumn of
                                        1949 until March 1950 combined the two theories; goods of
                                        strategic value were either prohibited or limited to
                                        quantities which represented normal civilian need, and
                                        non-strategic goods were permitted to flow freely. Our China
                                        trade policy was more liberal than that for other countries
                                        in the Soviet sphere. In March 1950, the actions of the
                                        Chinese Communist regime had removed the reason for drawing
                                        this distinction; thereafter China was treated on the same
                                        basis as the U.S.S.R. and the Eastern European satellites.
                                        The North Korean aggression in June produced a further
                                        tightening of United States export controls; after June all
                                        United States Positive List exports to Communist China and
                                        North Korea were embargoed. The increasingly apparent
                                        dependence of North Korean military potential upon supplies
                                        and manpower from the Manchurian hinterland demonstrated, in
                                        our view, the wisdom of this decision. The Paris
                                        Consultative Group was, somewhat sluggishly, following our
                                        line of thought; in July it agreed to take the action the
                                        United States had taken in March and placed China on the
                                        same basis as the U.S.S.R. so far as its prohibited list was
                                        concerned.</item>
                                    <item>Notwithstanding all these developments, the United States
                                        had not abandoned completely the “foot in the door” theory.
                                        We awaited, with <pb n="1926" xml:id="pg_1926" facs="0468"
                                        />anxiety and hope, evidence that the Chinese Communists, by
                                        their actions, could qualify for more or less normal
                                        treatment of our trade with China. Massive Chinese
                                        aggression in late November, however, confirmed our
                                        anxieties and removed our hopes. Between December 2 and
                                        December 17, the United States instituted comprehensive
                                        controls over all our economic relations with Communist
                                        China; we license no goods whatever for export to Communist
                                        China, we prohibit our ships and planes from calling at its
                                        ports or carrying any goods destined for its ports, we
                                        require offloading of United States Positive List items in
                                        transit through the United States jurisdiction, and we have
                                        frozen Communist Chinese assets within the United
                                        States.</item>
                                    <item>These steps obviously constituted an abandonment by this
                                        Government of the “foot in the door” theory. Several
                                        considerations seem to us to have justified resort to the
                                        alternative theory, economic warfare. In strictly economic
                                        terms the pattern of United States exports was such that to
                                        cut them off would, we felt, produce a measurable damaging
                                        effect upon the Chinese economy. Over seventy-five percent
                                        of China’s raw cotton imports were, for example, purchased
                                        from the United States. Cessation of these exports has hurt
                                        the Chinese textile industry, which, as is known, is the
                                        largest productive component in the modern sector of China’s
                                        industrial economy. Second, it was felt that export of
                                        multiple use within China—e.g. medicines and chemicals—was
                                        certain, under present circumstances, to be fed into the
                                        Chinese Communist war machine before being made available
                                        for civilian use. To permit this to occur would, we felt,
                                        represent collusion in the operations of the Chinese Red
                                        Army. Third, it was felt that no political advantage could
                                        be realized in Communist China by continuation of a
                                        business-as-usual attitude towards trade; on the contrary,
                                        it might well engender contempt for American lack of realism
                                        with respect to the political and military implications of
                                        China’s declared hostility and overt challenge of United
                                        States rights and interests and the purpose of the United
                                        Nations in Asia. Finally, the indignation developing in the
                                        United States, in Congress and among the people, over
                                        Chinese Communist aggression was such that legislative
                                        action might have been taken had the executive branch of the
                                        government not acted promptly to take the steps ref erred to
                                        previously.</item>
                                    <item>The United States policy and action in this field have, of
                                        course, resulted from a balancing of the harm which could be
                                        inflicted upon the Chinese Communists against the losses
                                        borne by the United States through adopting them. From our
                                        standpoint there is no question that, on balance,
                                        comprehensive economic sanctions against the Chinese
                                        Communists were clearly in our national interest. We

                                        not, voluntarily, prepared to consider in their national

                                could be left to each Member to determine what commodities would
                                qualify for inclusion in the embargo under this general formula and
                                to apply its own export control to such commodities. The resolution
                                should also contain in our view a recommendation that each Member of
                                the UN undertake not to negate the effectiveness of the embargo
                                applied by other complying States.</item>

                                enforcement of the embargo, we stated we would favor the
                                establishment of a committee to which all Members applying the
                                embargo would report periodically on the commodities whose export is
                                embargoed by such countries and the types of controls being applied.
                                This committee would review such reports and report thereon, with
                                appropriate recommendations, to the General Assembly. It might be
                                appropriate and less complicated to confer these reviewing and
                                reporting functions upon the special committee established pursuant

                                regarded as an irreducible minimum and suggested that we jointly
                                consider whether it might be wise tactics initially to propose a
                                more ambitious program and retreat to this in the face of certain
                                opposition. We also pointed out that the adoption of such a program
                                would in no way replace the steps we are now taking through <gloss

                                also be free to consult on the interpretation of the phrase “items

                                favorably to the above, Mr. Meade remarking he thought the US was
                                being moderate and reasonable and Mr. Burns stating that such a
                                program would not cause insuperable difficulties from the economic
                                point of view. They believed the Foreign Office reactions to the
                                foregoing would be forthcoming by next Monday, February 26th, and we
                                tentatively agreed to meet again at that time. </item>

                        <p>If the Foreign Assets Control is to be effective, it is essential that
                            the Treasury Department be able to identify and block the accounts of

                            for blocked nationals. There are three types of cloaks or intermediaries
                            which the Foreign Assets Control desires to block as quickly as
                            possible: <list>

                                <item>At the time the Foreign Assets Control was established, it was
                                    confronted with the immediate policy problem whether it would be
                                    desirable from an administrative standpoint to halt the
                                    operations of all Chinese and Korean business enterprises in the
                                    U.S. falling under the classification of blocked nationals,
                                    including even small Chinese laundries and restaurants, pending
                                    such time as they could apply to the Treasury Department for a
                                    special business operating license. Based upon the experience of
                                    the Treasury Department in the past war, it was decided that
                                    this would not be a practical approach. It was decided,
                                    therefore, to grant all such enterprises a general business
                                    operating license permitting them to carry on their normal
                                    business operations in the U.S. on condition that they take no
                                    action to diminish their capital.</item>
                                <label/>
                                <item>This approach imposes a duty on the enforcement section of the
                                    Foreign Assets Control to cull out those enterprises which, on
                                    the basis of present available information, are truly likely to
                                    be operating for or on behalf of, or for the benefit of,
                                    Communist China or North Korea or nationals thereof. This would,
                                    of course, be largely based upon such factors as the Communist
                                    affiliations of the managerial staff in the United States, the
                                    degree of control from Communist China or North Korea, etc. At
                                    the present time the Foreign Assets Control does not have the
                                    factual background necessary for making such determinations and
                                    is dependent for such information on the data which other
                                    agencies may be able to supply.</item>

                                <item>Where information furnished to the Treasury Department
                                    indicates that Chinese or North Korean business enterprises in
                                    the United States now enjoying the benefits of the general
                                    business enterprise license are sufficiently suspicious in
                                    character to warrant their being placed under closer
                                    supervision, the privileges of this general license can be
                                    withdrawn and the enterprise concerned can be placed under
                                    specific licenses as restrictive in their provisions as the
                                    circumstances may require. Since such enterprises are already
                                    defined as Chinese or North Korean “nationals” within the
                                    meaning of the basic regulations, and have merely been enjoying
                                    a privilege in receiving the benefits of the general business
                                    operating license, burden of proof necessary in order to justify
                                    withdrawal of the privileges of the general license is
                                    relatively light. For this reason, among others, it is
                                    administratively desirable to take action without delay against
                                    Chinese and Korean enterprises in the U.S. which are believed to
                                    be responsive to Communist control.</item>

                                    that they are acting for or on behalf of Communist China or
                                    North Korea or nationals thereof. Thus, for example, before
                                    taking action with respect to American citizens believed to be
                                    acting for or on behalf of nationals of Communist China or North
                                    Korea, the Foreign Assets Control would wish to have specific
                                    evidence of actual transactions together with information
                                    regarding the Communist affiliations or loyalties of the persons
                                    or enterprises involved. Moreover, it may be anticipated in this
                                    category of cases that the persons or enterprises concerned will
                                    be more likely to demand administrative hearings or even court
                                    proceedings in which it will be necessary to set forth formally
                                    the evidence on the basis of which action was taken.</item>

                                    Swiss francs by Chinese principals, or, on the contrary, they
                                    might represent a dollar credit to a dollar account with a bank
                                    in Switzerland. In the latter type of case, it might well be
                                    asserted that there is a Chinese interest in the omnibus dollar
                                    account in the name of a Swiss bank on the books of a banking
                                    institution in the United States. Any information, therefore,
                                    regarding such transfers or regarding Chinese Communist or North
                                    Korean beneficial interests in omnibus dollar accounts would be

                        <p>Ambassador Gross requested this meeting to continue the discussions of
                            the program of work for the Additional Measures Committee based on the
                            list of questions which its bureau had prepared (confidential paper No.
                                2—US/A/AC.52/12).<note n="1" xml:id="d268fn1">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador Gross pointed out the desirability of the subcommitee, which
                            is charged with drafting a plan of work, meeting within the next few
                            days. He had called this meeting so that the UK, France and UK might
                            perhaps have an agreed position before going into the subcommittee. He
                            pointed out that the State Department considers it undesirable to
                            attempt through the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> to obtain
                            additional military support for operations in Korea. It would prefer to
                            see troops on a more selective basis by bilateral negotiations and not
                            through an appeal in the General Assembly. He suggested that the
                            subcommittee should simply take note of this problem in its report.</p>
                        <p>Turning then to economic measures, he wanted to impress upon our UK and
                            French colleagues the importance which we attach to these. He referred
                            to the policy of the US to emphasize the importance and interest it has
                            in seeing all members of the UN apply maximum economic controls. Then he
                            went on to state the “irreducible minimum” which the US considers
                            consistent with our own thoughts on the matter <pb n="1932"
                                xml:id="pg_1932" facs="0474"/>and less than which it does not feel
                            the UN can do. He then described a resolution calling for an embargo on
                            the selected items mentioned in our instructions and the plan for having
                            each member determining what items qualify together with a body for
                            reviewing and reporting action pursuant to such embargo. He added that a
                            committee for this purpose would review and report to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> with appropriate recommendations in terms
                            of operating expense. Lacoste commented at this point that France has a
                            very different line in that it would like nothing to come from the
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> or from its subcommittee but a
                            report. He stressed the undesirability of having any recommendations in
                            this field originate either from this Committee or a proposed new review
                            committee.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Gross continued that the US would urge its general policy in
                            the Committee of maximum economic controls but will take into account
                            different points of view which might lead to the sort of resolution
                            outlined. He stressed the importance of advance agreement to get broad
                            sponsorship for the sort of resolution described. He restated the
                            importance we attach to giving the highest priority to economic measures
                            and what we consider the “irreducible minimum” in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Coulson commented that the UK would like the subsequent talks completed
                            in the State Department before going into the substance in New York.
                            Therefore, he would prefer to limit discussion here to the procedure for
                            arriving at a program of work. He stated the British view that the first
                            priority in framing such a plan should be an appeal for more support
                            from contributing and non-contributing powers. He thought a general
                            recommendation in this sense could be put into practice in a way
                            consistent with the thinking of the State Department by having the
                            Unified Command originate a request pursuant to a policy that might be
                            formulated by the Committee itself.</p>
                        <p>Coulson indicated that he thought the Committee should get on with a
                            discussion of additional military assistance as soon as possible; he in
                            effect agreed with a comment by Mr. Gross that part of the British
                            reason for this view was to delay or defer discussion of economic
                            sanctions which he said the British basically do not feel should be
                            discussed in the Committee at all.</p>
                        <p>Lacoste wondered whether a distinction could not be drawn between
                            punitive measures and those that would really cripple the war potential
                            of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Coulson indicated that he did not believe that the question of a pure
                            arms embargo as such had ever been put to the Foreign Office. He said
                            the Foreign Office was anxious to avoid all publicity concerning
                            economic measures.</p>
                        <pb n="1933" xml:id="pg_1933" facs="0475"/>
                        <p>Lacoste wondered whether it were not true that at least certain economic
                            measures would help cripple the enemy effort in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross reviewed our objections to taking up military measures in the
                            Committee. The publicity attendant on such a move would inevitably raise
                            such questions as why the UN should not go further, for example, bombing
                            of Chinese territory, making clear that we do want more military
                            assistance. He had felt that such assistance might best be provided
                            through bilateral channels. Mr. Gross then commented, explaining that he
                            was speaking quite personally, that he wondered whether some very simple
                            form of request for additional assistance might be worked out which
                            could be disposed of in perhaps a very few days. Provision might be made
                            for concurrent consideration of the economic measures.</p>
                        <p>Lacoste said that his Government very definitely favored the objective
                            that a limited economic embargo should come first. He said his
                            Government felt that the timing was very bad to issue some “sonorous
                            appeal” for more help, particularly of a military character. He said
                            this would have a very unsettling effect now that there was a lull, if
                            not actually a stalemate in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross summarized the views expressed by indicating that there seemed
                            to be three shades of opinion. First, the UK wanted to take up the
                            question of military assistance first of all. Second, the French wanted
                            to take up the question of military assistance at a later time. The US
                            was not interested in taking up this question at all.</p>
                        <p>Lacoste explained that in the French view the question of military
                            assistance should be taken up at the end of the list, but they would not
                            insist that it should be taken up at all.</p>
                        <p>Coulson observed that we would be playing the Chinese game if we were
                            “lulled by a lull”. He said we should take advantage of any lull and not
                            give the impression that we were weakening. He agreed with Mr. Gross’
                            summary of the three shades of view expressed and said that he thought
                            that perhaps what we should seek was a “Triboro Bridge”.</p>
                        <p>Continuing the discussion on March 19, Ambassador Gross, in the light of
                            the differing UK approach on the matter of priority, suggested combining
                            the work on military measures with that on economic measures. He saw no
                            complex issue involved in the study of the military questions. He
                            suggested putting the economic measures in subcommittee and perhaps
                            keeping the other before the full Committee. This would take care of
                            both topics on parallel lines and avoid a possible road block. Sir
                            Gladwyn, who was not present at the first meeting on March 16, agreed to
                            put this suggestion to London. He commented that under his present
                            instructions the Foreign Office dislikes even discussing the matter of
                            economic sanctions until the <pb n="1934" xml:id="pg_1934" facs="0476"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> has reached a result. In this
                            connection he observed that Mr. Rusk had recently raised the issue of
                            the 38th parallel at a briefing in Washington and suggested that there
                            might soon be a statement on that and suggested a possible declaration.
                            Sir Gladwyn thought this might have a considerable effect on the wisdom
                            of going ahead with the study of economic sanctions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Gross felt that the time is coming when we should discuss
                            these questions with others and he had refrained from going into it with
                            other members of the Committee in spite of heavy pressure to do so. Jebb
                            saw no objection to bringing in the other two members of the,
                            subcommittee, Venezuela and Australia, after perhaps one more meeting of
                            this group, and it was agreed that the chairman of the subcommittee
                            would then be Lacoste. Lacoste was insistent that first priority be
                            given to economic matters, although he did not object to considering
                            military items after that. He was impressed with Gross’ argument on the
                            reasons for not going into military matters in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Gross commented that he thought
                            bilateral discussions hold the greatest promise for obtaining greater
                            military assistance and doubted whether an appeal would be helpful and
                            it might cause more ill feeling. Jebb restated the UK opposition to
                            going ahead with economic measures while there was any hope for the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>. Coulson did not feel that the
                            UK is in any way committed to sanctions. If they were to be considered
                            he rather preferred the US approach of a formula that would not involve
                            the Committee getting into a list of embargoed articles, but the UK had
                            no further reaction from the Foreign Office on the substance of the US
                            suggestion. He did feel that the idea of a committee to coordinate and
                            review was too broad. Lacoste, on the other hand, preferred not having a
                            committee at all and at least suggested the idea of a specific embargo
                            list. Gross pointed out the endless difficulties of definition and
                            debate that this might involve for the Committee. Coulson argued that
                            the way to get an extension of the Coordinating Committee system of
                            embargoes is to proceed privately with powers who are not members of
                            that group. He is certain that India would not identify itself with any
                            UN move and he did not think it desirable to publicize in any way the
                            Coordinating Committee list.</p>
                        <p>Developing his thinking somewhat further, Coulson inquired what good it
                            would do to try to repeat in the UN the very complicated and
                            time-consuming process of drawing up lists. This was a process which
                            took weeks of time of the experts who frequently found it difficult to
                            agree even on a proper nomenclature in the English language. He
                            reiterated his view that we should continue with the process of the <pb

                            most of the producing countries were involved in <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that there were two problems under consideration: (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) what measures the UN should recommend and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) what would be the best means of implementing
                            UN recommendations. We were assuming that there would be UN
                            recommendations and were now discussing the question of means.</p>
                        <p>Lacoste felt that for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> recommendations
                            to be effective, it would be essential to have some list which the
                            customs people could use.</p>
                        <p>Jebb, assuming a general recommendation by the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss>, wondered whether <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> might secretly draw up appropriate lists which in
                            turn, without revealing the origin of these lists, might be communicated
                            to the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> by some one of us. Mr. Gross
                            wondered whether, alternatively, instead of introducing lists in the
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>, such lists might not be passed
                            around through bilateral channels to governments concerned. Coulson and
                            Jebb felt that it was very doubtful whether a country such as Argentina
                            would have any idea how to proceed when confronted with a general
                            recommendation that certain items should be embargoed (petroleum, arms,
                            ammunition, implements of war), A good deal of our discussion centered
                            around the question of how implements of war should be defined.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross wondered whether the US, UK and France might separately report
                            to the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> what it was doing. These
                            lists could be used by other governments for their guidance. Coulson
                            objected on the grounds that this might involve revealing information
                            concerning classified items; Gross indicated that classified items could
                            of course be eliminated from any list we might circulate.</p>
                        <p>Laskey said that if lists were circulated of items embargoed so far as
                            Communist China was concerned the question would immediately arise of
                            extending the embargo to the USSR. This would tend to force into the
                            open the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> activities concerning
                            the USSR and satellites.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gross pointed out that we contemplated a <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                >GA</gloss> resolution calling upon all Member Governments to give
                            assurances that they would not negate measures taken by other Member
                            Governments. If such assurances were not forthcoming, as in the case of
                            the USSR, the UN might then call on all Members to embargo the items in
                            question to the countries which refused to give such assurances.</p>
                        <p>Jebb observed that this would amount to extending the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> system to India since he did not at
                            all anticipate that India would give assurances that it would not export
                            embargoed items to Communist China. Jebb went on to say that he thought
                            the best we could do would <pb n="1936" xml:id="pg_1936" facs="0478"/>be
                            to lay down broad categories and that each country would then do what it
                            thought best.</p>
                        <p>Lacoste queried what we were really after. Were we attempting to meet the
                            problems presented by our own public opinion or were we attempting to
                            have a psychological effect on the Chinese Communists? Mr. Gross
                            responded that while we felt that the moral and psychological effects of
                            a program of limited economic sanctions might even outweigh the material
                            effects, nevertheless, we felt that the material effects might be very
                            great since the effect of controls was the coefficient of the severity
                            of controls and the generality of their application. He said that in
                            suggesting a program of limited economic controls, we were not putting
                            forward a maximum program but only the program which we considered an
                            irreducible minimum. We really hoped that we could get all countries to
                            go at least as far as <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> had gone
                            and we hoped we could get <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> to go
                            as far as we had gone.</p>
                        <p>Laskey observed that the maximum moral impact would be achieved by a
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> resolution but that no reporting
                            or exchanging of lists was required because suppliers outside of the
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> group were not important
                            with the exception of one or two, such as Australia, which could be
                            dealt with bilaterally. Laskey then inquired with reference to Mr.
                            Gross’ last remarks whether we had in mind a reporting and reviewing
                            system as a means of getting people lined up for an initial program
                            which would provide the basis for building up and extending economic
                            measures against Communist China beyond the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> system. Mr. Gross made clear that we were not now
                            pressing nor did we now contemplate such an extension of economic
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>At this point, the hour being late, it was agreed to continue the
                            discussion on Thursday morning, March 22.</p>

                        <p>United States economic sanctions for China have created economic
                            difficulties for Hong Kong which the British believe endanger the <pb

                            British Foreign Office and the Government of Hong Kong have evolved a
                            formula for making possible more liberal treatment of United States
                            exports for Hong Kong without seriously impairing the effectiveness of
                            our embargo on exports to Communist China.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the foreign policy implications of the Hong Kong problem
                            justify acceptance of the British formula, with slight modifications, as

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Since early December
                            when our embargo for Communist China was instituted, the British
                            Government has been asking us to remedy the seriously damaging effects
                            upon the internal situation at Hong Kong which were being produced by
                            our China trade policy. These approaches, most of which were dealt with
                            where possible on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> relief basis, were
                            climaxed on February 1 when the British Embassy, accompanied by the
                            Director of Trade and Industry of the Government of Hong Kong who came
                            to Washington specifically for this purpose, left with us an <hi
                                rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> the terms <pb n="1938"
                                xml:id="pg_1938" facs="0480"/>of which are known to representatives
                            of your Department (Enclosure 1).<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">See

                        <p>On March 5 and March 15 the British Embassy again made representations to
                            the Department for an answer to the <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>
                            and I feel obliged to ask for your urgent consideration of and
                            concurrence in our draft reply (Enclosure 2).<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d270fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The British <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi> of February 1 recommended
                            a method whereby Hong Kong’s needs for imports from the United States
                            could be met without danger that the effectiveness of the United States
                            embargo on exports for Communist China would be significantly impaired.
                            In brief, their proposal consisted of three parts. <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Hong Kong Government Guarantees: The Government of Hong Kong
                                    has offered guarantees that the United States goods will not be
                                    transshipped to Communist China, before or after fabrication.
                                    Although some possibility of leakage would exist, these
                                    guarantees are the most that the Government of Hong Kong can
                                    offer, in good faith, within their capability to
                                    administer.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Positive List Items: Recognizing the importance to us of
                                    absolute denial of strategic goods of United States origin to
                                    Communist China, the British acquiesce in a procedure whereby
                                    all United States exports to Hong Kong of goods which qualify
                                    for our Positive List should be subjected to case by case
                                    handling pending evolution of more satisfactory arrangements,
                                    e.g. agreement upon the precise conditions for prompt licensing
                                    within established programs of Positive List items most
                                    essential for the Hong Kong economy.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Non-Positive Items: The British have suffered the paralyzing
                                    impact on normal commercial relationships between Hong Kong and
                                    the United States of item by item handling of all United States
                                    exports to Hong Kong. The British recommend that the Commerce
                                    Department automatically grant licenses for the export of
                                    non-Positive List items up to a volume of 75% of the
                                    volume—category by category—of 1949 United States exports to
                                    Hong Kong. British authorities believe that 75% represents the
                                    volume of imports which was consumed locally at Hong Kong or
                                    transhipped to other than Communist Far Eastern
                                    destinations.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>We recognize as do the British that this <hi rend="italic">modus
                                operandi</hi> would entail risk of some marginal transshipment of
                            non-strategic goods of United States origin to Communist China. Neither
                            we nor they believe that the leakage would be large or strategically
                            significant. Against the risk of that leakage are set far greater risks
                            to the internal security and safety of Hong Kong to which the British
                            and the free world generally must under present circumstances attach
                            importance.</p>
                        <p>We believe that we should recognize in our policy the British contention
                            that continuation of the present United States export restrictions <pb
                                n="1939" xml:id="pg_1939" facs="0481"/>will result shortly in
                            shutdown of industrial plant at Hong Kong, Communist exploitation of the
                            mass of unemployed and spreading dislocation in the internal economy. We
                            believe that Hong Kong finds itself in a precarious security position
                            and that its loss, if it occurs, will come about as a result of military
                            pressure in combination with internal subversion. For Hong Kong to be
                            lost or to be placed in serious jeopardy in such a way that the United
                            States would be held partly responsible by the official and business
                            community in Great Britain and at Hong Kong would have serious divisive
                            effects upon United States-United Kingdom relations not only with
                            respect to Asia but also within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> structure. It would furthermore raise grave doubts in
                            the minds of some of our other allies as to the maturity and sense of
                            responsibility of United States leadership in this period of mounting
                            world tensions. Such a spectacle, we believe, would lower the prestige
                            of the free world in Asia and that of the United States throughout the
                            free world. It would provide at the same time a rich harvest for
                            Communist propagandists.</p>
                        <p>Of even greater importance is the direct interest of the United States in
                            minimizing the risk that its policy towards Hong Kong will offer pretext
                            to the Chinese Communists to launch offensive operations against Hong
                            Kong, thereby presenting the necessity of a military decision to accept
                            or ignore another challenge to the military position of the Western
                            World in Asia. We feel, further, that if Hong Kong is lost or if
                            conditions of serious unrest within the Colony develop, the United
                            States would lose, not only its most fruitful remaining source of
                            intelligence on the operations and intentions of the Chinese Communist
                            regime but also a point of contact with mainland China, the exploitation
                            of which, by ourselves or our allies, may contribute to the pursuit of
                            our objectives.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that drastic treatment of the British at Hong Kong may
                            eliminate some risks of leakage of American goods to Communist China,
                            but to accomplish this at the political, psychological and military cost
                            here suggested would show a lack of proportion and perspective in
                            balancing and coordinating our foreign policy objectives.</p>
                        <p>These considerations have been discussed with representatives of the
                            Commerce and Defense Departments most recently in connection with the
                            National Security Council study of the State Department’s “Report to the
                            President on U.S. Policies and Programs in the Economic Field which may
                            Affect the War Potential of the Soviet Bloc.” Throughout working level
                            discussions of the problem, one basic issue appears to divide the
                            Department of State from the Departments of Commerce and Defense:</p>
                        <p>The controls imposed by the Government of Hong Kong represent <pb
                                n="1940" xml:id="pg_1940" facs="0482"/>a more comprehensive effort
                            to support United States export controls for China than is being
                            undertaken by any other governmental authority excepting only Japan. The
                            Government of Hong Kong applies an embargo on shipments to Communist
                            China of petroleum, all items on International List I, all munitions,
                            and a range of short supply items which are on the United States
                            Positive List, but not on International List I; it has instituted
                            procedures for policing trade in these items and in other items in which
                            the United States Government has or will ask that they take an interest.
                            It is true nevertheless that acceptance of the British proposal carries
                            some risk that exports of United States goods to Hong Kong might result
                            in the substitution of similar or identical non-American goods in the
                            trade of the Colony with Communist China. For this possibility to be
                            eliminated would require the imposition at Hong Kong of controls
                            identical in scope and severity with those being applied by the United
                            States. The Department of State takes the stand, hitherto unacceptable
                            to your Department, that for foreign policy reasons we should not
                            discriminate against Hong Kong unless and until we are prepared to
                            insist that other friendly countries impose an embargo parallel to our
                            own on all exports to China and severely penalize them if they do not do
                            so. I need hardly add that in the interests of obtaining the continued
                            cooperation of friendly countries in the broadest possible area of our
                            relations with them, this Department is opposed to any such course of
                            action under existing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Our export controls for Communist China constitute an important technique
                            for accomplishing the objectives of the United States in Asia and it
                            goes without saying that we desire the cooperation of friendly countries
                            in supporting our policy and program. However, where voluntary
                            cooperation is not offered, we should resort to compulsion or punishment
                            for non-cooperation only where it serves to guard against serious
                            threats to vital United States foreign policy interests and objectives.
                            We do not believe that trade leakages to Communist China through Hong
                            Kong justify the damage to United States–United Kingdom amity which
                            would result from an attempt to compel the cooperation necessary to
                            eliminate it completely.</p>
                        <p>You will note in the annexed draft reply to the British <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aide-Mémoire</hi> that we are not proposing that the British
                            recommendations be accepted in full. So far as Positive List exports to
                            Hong Kong are concerned, we indicate that the Commerce Department should
                            handle each license application on a case by case basis and should feel
                            free to require very full reports as to the end-use of exports of United
                            States origin, but should not use its inquiries as a means to apply
                            pressure to obtain controls, not already applied at Hong Kong, over
                            movements <pb n="1941" xml:id="pg_1941" facs="0483"/>of commodities of a
                            like kind from non-United States sources. So far as non-Positive List
                            exports are concerned we are suggesting that the Commerce Department
                            license automatically at a rate of 60% of the 1949 volume of United
                            States exports to Hong Kong whereas the British suggested 75%. Further,
                            we are warning the British that the operation of this formula should be
                            kept under continuous review.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that our general policy on exports for Hong Kong is related to
                            action by the National Security Council on the “Report to the President
                            on U.S. Policies and Programs in the Economic Field which may Affect the
                            War Potential of the Soviet Bloc.” I am writing this letter in the hope
                            that your concurrence in the annexed draft <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aide-Mémoire</hi> may make possible a prompt reply to the British
                            Government and also will serve to clarify the details of the general
                            issues upon which the National Security Council, in due course, will
                            wish to act.</p>
                        <p>I am addressing a letter on this subject to Secretary Marshall asking for
                            his concurrence as well as yours in our draft reply to the British <hi

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The problem raised in
                            your letter of March 22 regarding export policy towards Hong Kong has
                            been the subject of extended discussions among the Departments of State,
                            Defense and Commerce. The three Departments have been unable to find a
                            common meeting ground, and the issue has been referred to the National
                            Security Council as part of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104
                            paper. I, too, am anxious to reach a proper solution of this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty in reaching agreement appears to stem from a difference in
                            approach. The Defense and Commerce position is based on the premise that
                            our embargo on goods to Communist China is sound and that we cannot
                            permit the movement of U.S. goods, directly or indirectly, to Communist
                            China while our military forces are engaged in armed conflict with the
                            Communists. Because of its peculiar position as a major port of entry
                            for Chinese imports Hong Kong is necessarily affected by our Chinese
                            embargo policy.</p>
                        <p>We in the Department of Commerce fully appreciate the significance of
                            Hong Kong as an outpost of the free world and we recognize the
                            importance of maintaining the highest measure of cooperation between the
                            United States and the United Kingdom. We agree that every reasonable
                            effort should be made to supply Hong Kong with the commodities required
                            for the support of its basic economy. Nevertheless, we feel bound to
                            give the most serious consideration to the evident need to maximize the
                            effectiveness of the embargo upon the shipment of U.S. goods to China.
                            It was in an effort to develop a workable means of achieving these
                            objectives that the Department <pb n="1944" xml:id="pg_1944" facs="0486"
                            />drafted the proposed reply to the British <hi rend="italic"
                                >Aide-Mémoire</hi> which was transmitted to Mr. Rusk by Mr. Miller
                            on February 21st.<note n="1" xml:id="d273fn1">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I believe that it should be possible to work out a reconciliation of the
                            views of our Departments. I have accordingly instructed officers of my
                            Department to initiate discussions with appropriate members of your
                            staff for the purpose of working out a reasonable solution of the
                            present differences as rapidly as possible. It appears to me that this
                            is likely to prove the most fruitful line of action and I hope that you
                            will give it every necessary support. Pending the outcome of these
                            discussions, I would suggest that consideration of the Hong Kong issue
                            in connection with the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104 paper be
                            suspended so that the other matters dealt with in that paper can be
                            acted upon without delay.</p>

                        <p>This meeting was called by Ambassador Gross to lay a foundation for
                            moving on with the work of the Additional Measures Committee.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Military Measures</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Gross referring to Jebb’s suggestion that military measures be given
                            priority commented that we thought there were many disadvantages to
                            involving the Additional Measures Committee in military matters but that
                            if it were to be done it might be got out of the way at once in the full
                            Committee. Jebb commented that he had made the suggestion because he
                            thought military matters were a non-controversial item but in the light
                            of the United States point of view he did not press the idea.</p>
                        <p>It was therefore agreed that no immediate attention would be given in the
                            Additional Measures Committee to military matters.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Economic Measures</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In opening this subject Gross felt there was general agreement on a
                            program of economic measures along the lines of the United States
                            proposals (position paper dated March 26, 1951).<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d275fn1">See the attachment to the memorandum by Mr. Popper
                                of April 12, <ref target="#pg_1953">p. 1953</ref>.</note> He
                            restated the essence of these proposals from the position paper and
                            agreed at the <pb n="1947" xml:id="pg_1947" facs="0489"/>request of the
                            French to give them the substance of this in writing purely as an
                            informal working paper.</p>
                        <p>As to timing the introduction of such proposals into the subcommittee,
                            Gross realized that no decision could be reached at this meeting,
                            because there were other related negotiations going on which would make
                            it impossible to decide at this moment on when to proceed. There was
                            general agreement that this was correct. Gross went on to say that he
                            would feel the time had come for us to discuss these measures with other
                            delegations and Jebb and Coulson understood this, observing that they
                            hoped we would conduct our consultations without publicity. Jebb
                            commented that we understood the uncertainty of his Government on the
                            desirability of sanctions. He expected to talk with the Canadians and
                            explore with them their thinking that any measures in this Committee be
                            strictly limited to their proximate result in Korea. It was agreed that
                            consultations would take place forthwith and Gross felt that there would
                            not be any particular publicity connected with our talks.</p>
                        <p>Much of the conversation was about compliance with any proposed Assembly
                            resolution and the role of a special committee. It was agreed that the
                            United States theory of a formula as contained in the position paper
                            mentioning specifically only petroleum, atomic energy materials, arms,
                            ammunition, implements of war, etc. would be agreeable. Jebb commented
                            that he had no objection to this formula, which he termed a short list,
                            and was willing to drop his suggestion of a detailed list since the
                            United States disliked it. However, Coulson argued that when we come to
                            compliance he saw certain advantages in a specific list. Lacoste
                            commented that he sees this plan as a general measure having principally
                            a moral aspect, because 90% of the trade with Communist China that we
                            can control is already controlled. The remaining 10%, about which we are
                            talking, he called a “small material thing” secondary in its importance
                            to the moral aspect of the plan.</p>
                        <p>He went on to warn that if our plan as outlined did not command a
                            substantial majority its mass moral effect would then be negligible and
                            in his view it would be better to settle for the 90% control of exports
                            which we now have and not risk a defeat on the moral issue.</p>
                        <p>Coming then to the question of compliance with the proposed formula,
                            Barnett outlined how the plan would work. He observed that an embargo is
                            largely in effect now. Assuming the resolution were adopted each state
                            would indicate to the new committee what materials were covered by its
                            interpretation of the formula. This would be a dynamic program that the
                            Latin Americans would probably agree to, although in fact their exports
                            to Communist China are negligible. The adoption of the resolution by the
                            Assembly would be the acceptance of this principle. The next step would
                            be the announcement in the <pb n="1948" xml:id="pg_1948" facs="0490"
                            />Committee of actual controls by each state. The United States would
                            announce what it was doing. Coulson stated that the United Kingdom would
                            state that items covered by the formula are subject to export licenses
                            and they would not be issued. Lacoste was not able to state what the
                            French approach would be.</p>
                        <p>Arriving at uniformity of action under the formula would be worked out
                            bilaterally. After this the Committee would make periodic studies of
                            controls and consider what gaps there were in the way the system was
                            operating. If it were not possible to close these gaps by the machinery
                            of the United Nations, efforts would be made through diplomatic
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>It was generally assumed that the Soviet Union and probably India would
                            not take any steps to follow the recommendation of the proposed
                            resolution and the question would then arise how to handle this. Jebb
                            wondered how we would know who was not complying by trans-shipment or
                            strained interpretation of the formula and what the Committee should do
                            about it. It became clear that the one real issue as Gross stated it was
                            the problem of non-conformity after the committee was operating. Jebb
                            commented that we would not desire to extend any embargo to India as
                            punishment for non-compliance, because the resolution is merely a
                            recommendation and neither legally nor politically would it be desirable
                            to punish the Indians for their disregard of it. Barnett and Allen
                            commented that it was clear that we do not intend to extend the embargo
                            against India and this would be a problem we could approach only through
                            diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>Gross commented that the Indian attitude would in no sense be a new
                            problem, because they would be doing then exactly what they were doing
                            now. He wondered what the committee would do about Soviet
                            non-compliance. It occurred to him that there might come a time when the
                            United States would want to announce in the committee what in fact we
                            are already doing in the way of embargoing exports to the Soviet Union.
                            Barnett commented that so far as India is concerned, our approach to
                            non-compliance would be along the lines of scrutinizing export licenses
                            with the possibility of trans-shipment in mind. Gross thought it was
                            possible that there would be pressure in the committee to get the Soviet
                            Union involved in some United Nations type embargo. He added that this
                            would be something that the committee could undertake under its power to
                            review and report to the Assembly with appropriate recommendations.
                            Barnett commented that another type of recommendation the committee
                            might make would be to broaden the scope of the embargo. For example, it
                            might recommend that food be embargoed as a way to weaken the Red army
                            and also items that have a dual civilian-military use, such as
                            transportation equipment. Coulson thought that these were matters better
                            discussed <pb n="1949" xml:id="pg_1949" facs="0491"/>in the Coordinating
                            Committee but Barnett thought that we would want to argue our rationale
                            for full economic warfare against China.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed with the understanding that we would be free to
                            discuss this plan confidentially with other delegations and that we
                            would confer again about the timing of presenting such a plan to the
                            subcommittee.</p>

                            consideration within the Department of Defense and have been thoroughly
                            discussed in the Senior Staff of the National Security Council in
                            connection with the Senior Staff’s consideration of the <gloss

                        <p>In the discussions of the Senior Staff it quickly became apparent that
                            the wide divergencies of viewpoint expressed by the Representatives of
                            the several Departments involved could not be resolved in short order,
                            although it appeared that further investigation and discussion might
                            develop some mutually acceptable basis of agreement. Accordingly, in the

                            Council of the balance of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104

                        <p>The Department of Defense concurs in this course of action in the
                            understanding that the existing policy of restrictions on trade with
                            Hong Kong be continued in effect pending the ultimate determination of
                            the question by the National Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense is prepared to cooperate fully with the
                            Department of State and the Department of Commerce in the effort to find
                            some acceptable basis for the resolution of this difficult and
                            complicated problem. In this connection, I believe the following
                            observations and considerations are pertinent: <list>

                                <item>Recognizing the great importance which the United Kingdom
                                    attaches to the maintenance and protection of the integrity of
                                    Hong <pb n="1950" xml:id="pg_1950" facs="0492"/>Kong, the
                                    Department of Defense is nevertheless reluctant unduly to
                                    associate the military position of the Western world in Asia
                                    with the retention of Hong Kong which, as your letter points, is
                                    in a precarious security position;</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The Department of Defense can not accept the proposition
                                    suggested in the British <hi rend="italic">Aide-Mémoire</hi>
                                    forwarded with your letter that the United States, by virtue of
                                    its prevailing trade practices, could be held responsible to any
                                    substantial degree for the loss of or serious jeopardy to Hong
                                    Kong. According to data available in the Department of Defense,
                                    the British statements on the influence of the United States
                                    restrictions on trade with Hong Kong are greatly
                                    exaggerated;</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>The Department of Defense is seriously concerned over the
                                    increasing volume of imports into Communist China from
                                    non-Communist nations other than the United States. This trade
                                    is providing increasing military assistance to Communist China,
                                    and thereby constitutes a direct threat to the security
                                    interests of the United States and to the UN forces fighting in
                                    Korea. The Department of Defense believes that the United States
                                    Government should press other nations for immediate denial of
                                    all commodities and services to Communist China which may be
                                    used to support military operations. Accordingly, the Department
                                    of Defense strongly believes that it is directly in our military
                                    interest to persuade other friendly countries to impose economic
                                    restrictions, parallel to our own, on all exports to Communist
                                    China.</item>

                            Affect the War Potential of the Soviet Bloc”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104/2 contains a revised version of
                            the substantive recommendations which were originally included in the
                            Department’s recommendations to the President on “United States Policies
                            and Programs in the Economic Field Which May Affect the War Potential of
                            the Soviet Bloc” (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104). You will
                            recall that the National Security Council at the time <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104 first came before it approved the
                            recommendation that all United States exports to the Soviet Union be
                            brought under export licensing control and referred the remainder of the
                            recommendation to the Special Committee on East-West Trade. As a result
                            of the discussions in the East-West Trade Committee and in the Senior
                            Staff, a number of recommendations have been spelled <pb n="1951"
                                xml:id="pg_1951" facs="0493"/>out in considerably greater detail.
                            The recommendations as they now stand in <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 104/2 represent full agreement of the departments and
                            agencies represented on the Committee. Although in revising the
                            recommendations certain modifications were made to meet the views of
                            other agencies, it is believed that all essential points in the
                            Department’s original recommendation have been retained.</p>
                        <p>The one issue on which there has been disagreement (the treatment of
                            United States exports to Hong Kong) has been omitted from <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104/2 and will be the subject of a
                            separate report to the National Security Council. This problem is
                            currently under discussion with the Department of Commerce pursuant to
                            Mr. Sawyer’s letter of March 30, attached as Tab A. It appears likely
                            that a satisfactory solution to the Hong Kong problem will be possible
                            in the near future.</p>

                                China</hi> (Recommendation 9)</p>
                        <p>This recommendation has been revised since it originally was placed in
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 104. It now expresses a general
                            goal for action to be sought in obtaining international control measures
                            to diminish the Chinese Communist military potential. While the
                            recommendation specifies steps that should be taken through the United
                            Nations, the action is not intended to be limited to the United Nations
                            channels. Since our objective is to obtain as wide an agreement as
                            possible over controls affecting China, it seems more effective to limit
                            our approach to controlling a selective group of strategic commodities
                            which would enable a large number of countries to join in a common
                            security effort, rather than to propose a complete embargo which would
                            be so severe a measure that it would probably not command wide support
                            by a large number of other countries.</p>

                                    immediately related to the Korean situation—for example,
                                    additional assistance to United Nations forces in Korea.</item>

                        <p>We pointed out to Mr. Meade that the British position left us some <pb
                                n="1953" xml:id="pg_1953" facs="0495"/>what perplexed and
                            disappointed. We wondered whether “a selective embargo on strategic
                            materials” was consistent with the United States’ formula for economic
                            sanctions, but Mr. Meade was not able to give us specific information on
                            the point. We also pointed out that the British position that no report
                            should be made until the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> fails is in
                            conflict with the General Assembly resolution of February 1, which
                            merely authorized the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> to defer its
                            report if the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> reported satisfactory
                            progress. As we all know, no progress whatever had been made by the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>. It appeared that the British
                            still believed that additional measures might provoke the Chinese
                            Communists to continue the aggression, while our analysis indicated that
                            they would if anything provide an additional stimulus for the Chinese
                            Communists to seek a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meade expressed inability to go into further detail, since he had no
                            elaboration of the message from London. He asked us to be certain that
                            the UK Delegation in New York did not become aware of his having
                            communicated the substance of the instruction to the UK Delegation
                            directly to the Department, and of course we agreed to do so.</p>

                                the Chinese Communist potential for military aggression and as will
                                carry the maximum weight of moral condemnation. Its efforts through
                                the United Nations and other channels should be directed to seeking,
                                on a cooperative basis, the application by the maximum number of
                                friendly countries of such controls for this purpose as the United
                                States considers would be in the common interest in fostering
                                collective security.</p>
                            <p>The United States has applied, within its own jurisdiction, complete
                                economic sanctions against Communist China. The successive measures
                                needed to bring our economic relations with Communist China under
                                control were climaxed by the Treasury Freezing Order issued on
                                December 16 under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act.
                                This order was issued after action on the policy question in the
                                National Security Council.</p>
                            <p>Since the autumn of 1949 when Communist control of the mainland was
                                complete there have been present within the United States two
                                opposed theories which it was thought could govern our trade
                                relations with Communist China. One was that maintenance of trade
                                relations represented “a foot in the door” to be exploited, if
                                possible, as a means for influencing Communist China to loosen its
                                ties with the Kremlin and to seek some reasonable <hi rend="italic"
                                    >modus operandi</hi> with the countries which had the most to
                                offer and most to gain from mutually advantageous economic
                                relations. The other theory was that Communist China should be
                                penalized, by economic means, for its declared hostility to the
                                West—and particularly the United States—and should be deprived of
                                goods which contributed to the success of a regime engaged in
                                programs of internal political repression and foreign
                                aggression.</p>
                            <p>The policy actually adopted by the United States from the autumn of
                                1949 until March 1950 combined the two theories; goods of strategic
                                value were either prohibited or limited to quantities which
                                represented normal civilian need, and non-strategic goods were
                                permitted to flow freely. Our China trade policy was more liberal
                                than that for other countries in the Soviet sphere.</p>

                            <p>In March, 1950 the actions of the Chinese Communist regime had
                                removed the reason for drawing this distinction; thereafter China
                                was treated on the same basis as the U.S.S.R. and the Eastern
                                European satellites. The North Korean aggression in June produced a
                                further tightening of United States export controls; after June all
                                United States Positive List exports to Communist China and North
                                Korea were embargoed.</p>
                            <p>The increasingly apparent dependence of North Korea military
                                potential upon supplies and manpower from the Manchurian hinterland
                                demonstrated, in our view, the wisdom of this decision. The Paris
                                Consultative Group was, under our pressure but somewhat sluggishly,
                                following our line of thought; in July it agreed to take the action
                                the United States had taken in March and placed China on the same
                                basis as the U.S.S.R. so far as its prohibited list was
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding all these developments, the United States had not
                                abandoned completely the “foot in the door” theory. We watched for
                                any evidence that the Chinese Communists, by their actions, could
                                qualify for more or less normal treatment of our trade with China.
                                Massive Chinese aggression in late November, however, removed any
                                such possibility. Between December 2 and December 17, the United
                                States instituted comprehensive controls over all our economic
                                relations with Communist China; we license no goods whatever for
                                export to Communist China, we prohibit our ships and planes from
                                calling at its ports or carrying any goods destined for its ports,
                                we require offloading of United States Positive List items in
                                transit through the United States jurisdiction, and we have frozen
                                Communist Chinese assets within the United States.</p>
                            <p>These steps obviously constituted final abandonment by this
                                Government of the “foot in the door” theory. Several considerations
                                have justified resort to the alternative theory, economic
                                warfare.</p>
                            <p>In strictly economic terms the pattern of United States exports was
                                such that to cut them off would, we felt, produce a measurable
                                damaging effect upon the Chinese economy. Over seventy-five percent
                                of China’s raw cotton imports were, for example, purchased from the
                                United States. Cessation of these exports has hurt the Chinese
                                textile industry which, as is known, is the largest productive
                                component in the modern sector of China’s industrial economy.</p>
                            <p>Second, it was felt that exports of multiple use within China—e.g.
                                medicines and chemicals—were certain, under present circumstances,
                                to be fed into the Chinese Communist war machine before being made
                                available for civilian use. To permit this to occur would, we felt,
                                represent collusion in the operations of the Chinese Red Army.</p>
                            <p>Third, it was felt that no political advantage could be realized in
                                    <pb n="1957" xml:id="pg_1957" facs="0499"/>Communist China by
                                continuation of a business-as-usual attitude towards trade; on the

                                realism with respect to the political and military implications of
                                China’s declared hostility and overt challenge of United States
                                rights and interests and the purposes of the United Nations in
                                Asia.</p>
                            <p>From our standpoint there is no question that comprehensive economic
                                sanctions against the Chinese Communists were clearly in our
                                national interest. We recognize, however, that other countries may
                                reach somewhat different conclusions or may reach our conclusion
                                more slowly than we have done.</p>

                                The full effects of disapproval and condemnation will not be felt in
                                China so long as the United States acts unilaterally. They would not
                                be fully felt if only those countries generally regarded as
                                susceptible to United States pressure applied sanctions. The moral
                                effect of sanctions upon Communist China will be produced in a
                                maximum degree only if substantially all of the non-Communist

                                all United Nations countries, which would equal and might surpass
                                the economic or military value of sanctions. Such sanctions would

                                position that the British have taken in recent discussions with
                                United States officials. The British have strongly opposed a full
                                embargo and expressed the hope that this idea would be discarded at
                                the earliest possible stage. In the United Kingdom view, it would be
                                unrealistic to expect the support of all countries (specifically
                                India, Burma and Pakistan as probable dissenters), and the British
                                felt that even if all countries did participate, it would not
                                achieve the objective since they do not consider China to be
                                seriously dependent on sea-borne imports. Thus, in the United
                                Kingdom view, a full embargo would not alter the course of military
                                operations in Korea, nor deflect the Chinese from further aggressive
                                operations elsewhere. The British Combined Chiefs see the gravest
                                political and military consequence in possible retaliation by the
                                Chinese Communists to any effort to impose and enforce a full

                                remains some slight area of maneuver within which a settlement of
                                Communist China-Free World differences may be worked out. Sanctions,
                                they say, would compel the Chinese Communists to orient all their
                                relationships toward the Kremlin, economic, as well as military and
                                political. Thus, sanctions would accelerate precisely what we are
                                attempting to frustrate, the complete and exclusive collaboration of
                                China and Russia in all aspects of China’s national life. Many
                                countries will say that although there may be little basis for
                                hoping that, within the limited area of maneuver which trade
                                relations offer, constructive developments will occur, nevertheless
                                if there is any hope, the United Nations should not be the agency
                                for blotting it out. Otherwise there can be no hope for anything

                                Soviet-dominated China. This line of argument collapses, in the U.S.
                                view, before the importance of denying an aggressor any material
                                support in his aggression and the political impact of a condemnation
                                of his action.</p>

                                find in other parts of the world relationships which can better

                                difficult actively to oppose an embargo on items clearly required

                                war, petroleum, and items useful in the production of arms,
                                ammunition and implements of war”. It is likely that other

                                means.</p>
                            <p>Experience has shown that the discussion of specific commodities,
                                particularly in a multilateral forum, frequently gives rise to
                                protracted argument and is apt to cloud the main issues of principle
                                upon which agreement is desired. Accordingly, it is believed that it
                                would be inappropriate for the United Nations to attempt to
                                enumerate the specific commodities to which the embargo would apply,
                                but the United States Government should use every appropriate
                                channel for indicating to friendly countries the rationale for the
                                economic controls which it now applies and should offer its
                                cooperation, where invited, in discussing controls more severe than
                                those agreed on in the United Nations. At the same time this is a
                                matter which must be clarified in some measure in order to obtain
                                support for the limited embargo proposed. It is therefore
                                recommended that the resolution include a provision authorizing each
                                Member of the United Nations to determine for itself what
                                commodities qualify for inclusion in the embargo. Such a general
                                provision would permit each Member to interpret the general formula
                                as narrowly or broadly as it desired. (For example, it would give a
                                certain United Nations sanction to the comprehensive embargo now
                                being applied with respect to Communist China by the United States.)
                                It will certainly make the resolution more palatable to individual
                                Members who might be reluctant to agree to the entirety of any
                                specifically enumerated list of commodities to be embargoed. This
                                would not preclude appropriate review of the programs of
                                participating governments in an appropriate forum at some later
                                time.</p>

                                be adopted to enforce embargoes of varying degrees of severity.
                                These point out that certain techniques, such as shipping controls,
                                fund freezing, etc., can be effective in stopping trade, but that it
                                would be difficult to obtain wide agreement in applying them.
                                Therefore, in the interests of securing as wide agreement as
                                possible to acceptance of the principle of an embargo, it has been
                                recommended that the resolution provide that each Member should
                                apply such of its own controls as it deems appropriate in
                                implementation and enforcement of the embargo in respect of such
                                commodities as it has decided fall within the general formula. Such
                                a provision will provide the freedom of action important to Members
                                such as the United States which desire to ensure complete control
                                over their exports to China while permitting <pb n="1962"

                                appropriate to their own particular situation.</p>
                            <p>The experience of the United States has shown that where the United
                                States considers application of controls in particular cases to be
                                of vital importance such cases can be handled most effectively
                                through private and <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> diplomatic
                                discussion. The general formula approach will not preclude and might
                                facilitate use of this technique. At the same time it will be
                                important that some means be found to prevent action, or lack of
                                action, by certain United Nations Members which will result in
                                weakening the effectiveness of steps taken by states which
                                conscientiously apply the export embargoes against China. For
                                example, an obvious problem would arise if certain United Nations
                                Members permitted war materials imported into their territory to be
                                trans-shipped or re-exported to Communist China. For this reason it
                                has been recommended that the resolution include a provision that
                                Members should not negate the effectiveness of measures to be
                                applied by other Member States. In short—to state the problem in
                                terms of broad principle—one United Nations country should not
                                subvert the controls of another United Nations country by permitting
                                trans-shipment or re-export through its jurisdiction of particular
                                items which that country embargoes and should not acquiesce in the
                                enlargement of exports to Communist China through its jurisdiction
                                of items being embargoed elsewhere. Once this provision had been
                                adopted by the General Assembly, it would be possible through

                                body discussed below to exert pressure upon states which failed to
                                stop up loopholes, thus permitting the flow of commodities to China
                                which obviously qualified for inclusion on any prohibited list.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>As suggested in the preceding section of this discussion, the United
                                States will, in the first instance, attempt to use regular
                                diplomatic channels to prevent the flow of commodities of high
                                strategic importance to China. It is likely that other delegations
                                will raise the question of some United Nations body to carry out
                                some review functions, and there is no reason why the use of regular
                                diplomatic channels cannot be combined with consideration of the
                                application and enforcement of the embargo in a United Nations
                                forum. The United States should therefore approve conferring a
                                review function upon some standing or <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                                United Nations organ. Accordingly, it is recommended that the United
                                States Representative should support or, if necessary, propose the
                                establishment of a committee to which all Members applying the
                                embargo would report periodically with respect to commodities being
                                embargoed and the controls being applied. Such a <pb n="1963"
                                    xml:id="pg_1963" facs="0505"/>committee would review the reports
                                and report thereon, with appropriate recommendations, to the General
                                Assembly. It is suggested that the precise area of such a
                                committee’s authority should be worked out in the course of
                                consultations with other delegations on this matter. At the outset
                                perhaps its function should be only that of receiving reports from
                                Members. It would seem appropriate to provide for the special
                                committee established in the February 1 resolution to assume this
                                task.</p>

                            <p>In addition to the considerations mentioned above, the other
                                delegations will, of course, be concerned with the effects which the
                                application of sanctions might have upon their own situations.

                        <p>Jebb (UK) stated it continued to be policy of his government to emphasize
                            “efforts for negotiated settlement with Peiping”. In this regard, he
                            cited north Korean “peace feeler” on which he did not place much hope
                            but felt it might indicate something. Therefore, he felt there should be
                            no report from <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> until it was
                            “abundantly clear” that no hope of negotiated settlement exists. If
                            nevertheless it were decided to press ahead, only sensible procedure in
                            his view was some sort of selective embargo such as Gross had outlined.
                            Basically, however, UK attitude is that taking additional measures now
                            would make Chi Comms less willing to negotiate. He intimated, however,
                            his government might be open to persuasion on this point. He also
                            suggested it might be wise to ask <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>

                            field” if efforts for negotiated settlement were to come to fruition. In
                            addition, he stated that to take matters on to the first comite would
                            only result in “re-exposition of bitter divisions”. Frankly speaking,
                            Shann thought many quarters feel chances for negotiated settlement now
                            much better and many sponsors of Feb. 1 res favor renewed efforts along
                            that line. He agreed with UK that North Korean “peace feeler” merits
                            observation and seconded suggestion to seek <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss>’s reaction.</p>
                        <p>Speaking as chairman, Lacoste stated divergence of views which appeared
                            from these remarks were not on matters of substance of US views where
                            indeed it is agreed, once embarking on such course, economic measures
                            should have priority; divergence exists in view of past week’s political
                            climate and feeling embarking on course outlined by Gross would be
                            dangerous and might nip successful developments in bud. Speaking as rep
                            of France, he associated himself with UK’s remarks that first
                            consideration must be peaceful settlement and everything else is
                            secondary. In summarizing, he felt one must consider two aspects of
                            problem: agreement and disagreement outlined previously, and he
                            questioned us in regard to its views on timing.</p>
                        <p>Gross replied substance and procedure are difficult to separate. He
                            reminded subcomite US has placed general embargo on all shipments to
                            Communist China. US view is that in principle it would be desirable for
                            maximum number of members to apply maximum of economic controls over
                            relations with China. US was aware of desirability and necessity of
                            obtaining widest acceptance of whatever measures adopted. He stressed
                            that proposals he had outlined were “irreducible minimum” and urgency of
                            US program is part thereof. This was so because such measures might
                            reasonably be adopted very soon, and questions <pb n="1966"
                                xml:id="pg_1966" facs="0508"/>of substance and timing were thereby
                            closely related. He warned as more time passes, limitedness of US
                            program becomes less practical.</p>
                        <p>As Gross understood UK point of view, <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                            >GOC</gloss>’s progress or lack of it has more definite relationship to
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> work than US willing to
                            recognize. Gross recalled Feb 1 res authorizes <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> to consider question of additional measures as “matter
                            of urgency”. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> was only
                            authorized to withhold report if and when <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> reported satisfactory progress. Gross stressed that
                            emphasis was placed and continues to remain on <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> unless and until <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>
                            reports progress. In addition, common sense favors this approach, for if
                            work of <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> were halted or were geared
                            to pace of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>, this would put premium
                            on failure of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>. Gross urged <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> work should not be considered as
                            starting only upon <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> failure. We had
                            favored “careful pace, but with sense of urgency”.</p>
                        <p>Jebb did not dissent from Gross’ views. He argued there has been sort of
                            “negative progress” of <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>, since it had
                            not been turned down yet. Even if <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>
                            makes report, Jebb cautioned this need not be positive report. In fact
                            it could say no measures appeared worthwhile taking. He felt selective
                            embargo was sensible course of action but only effect of such would be
                            “slight tightening of trade”. He questioned favorable psychological
                            effect on Chi Comms and pointed out that interpretation of psychological
                            effect was basis of divergence in views.</p>
                        <p>Shann injected another consideration in addition to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> as relating to <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> labors. This was military and diplomatic one of
                            declaration now being planned in Washington, London and Paris. Jebb
                            hastened to agree with this.</p>
                        <p>Gross said it seemed obvious that subcomite was not in position to
                            recommend a meeting date to <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. He
                            therefore posed some general questions to chairman.</p>
                        <p>Could subcomite agree on something? He suggested for example an agreement
                            in principle that matter of first priority was question of additional
                            economic measures. Secondly it might be agreed in principle that <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> should commence consideration of this
                            question in near future. He warned it was publicly known that subcomite
                            was meeting and if silence were only outcome implication would arise
                            that subcomite was recommending no action be taken.</p>
                        <p>Speaking again as chairman, Lacoste pointed out debate had gone beyond
                            terms of reference of subcomite in discussing matters of substance and
                            general philosophy of additional measures. He felt there had been
                            general agreement on what to do under certain circumstances. On other
                            hand, there was deep and grave disagreement on two important points
                            which lined up US on one hand and UK, France, and Australia on other.
                            First there was question of timing of <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> action <pb n="1967" xml:id="pg_1967" facs="0509"/>or
                            when it would be appropriate to make recommendations in report to <gloss
                                target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>. Secondly there was question of likely
                            psychological effects on Chi Comms of proposed course of action. On this
                            second point Lacoste felt US estimate to be that peace would be favored
                            by its course of action and hence desirable to present concrete plan of
                            action; that, to summarize this view, softness would be detrimental to
                            peace. In regard to Gross’ questions, consideration was whether
                            subcomite could, without fixing date for meeting of <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>, decide it would meet some time in near
                            future with certain plan of work. This, he stressed, was particular task
                            of subcomite to decide in accordance with terms of reference. Lacoste
                            suggested that subcomite either adjourn and consult with govts or
                            prepare agenda without fixing definite date. Jebb proposed compromise
                            that subcomite adjourn until Wednesday afternoon which would give time
                            for consultation. Then it could be suggested subcomite has agreed on
                            program of work, i.e., proposing study of selective embargo and that
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> meet when chairman decides.
                            Australia seconded UK’s proposal. UK stressed value of meeting Wednesday
                            so item on work of this subcomite would be in Thursday<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d282fn1">April 19.</note> papers. Gross suggested
                            possibility of studying substantive work in subcomite and proposed an
                            interim report by subcomite to <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> that
                            it was preparing program of work and requesting authority to consider
                            substantive matters. Lacoste questioned desirability of <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> meeting after so long period of silence
                            which in effect did nothing. Jebb renewed his suggestion of meeting on
                                Wednesday<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">April 18.</note> afternoon. It
                            was agreed that subcomite would meet again Wednesday 4 p. m.</p>

                        </table>
                        <p>Sir Oliver called at our request for a, discussion of our plan for action
                            by the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> in the economic field.</p>
                        <p>I outlined our proposal in some detail. I said that we thought that in
                            the light of the terms of the General Assembly resolution of February 1
                            and of the situation as we saw it, it was necessary for us to press for
                            action in the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. I stated that we
                            wished to avoid public disagreement with our friends in the <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> but that we felt it was now necessary
                            for the Committee to meet. We were suggesting April 30 as a possible
                            meeting date; we could hardly be accused of undue haste, because by that
                            time three months would have elapsed since the passage of the General
                            Assembly resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador surmised that our domestic opinion might account in part
                            for our activity—which I admitted—and noted that domestic opinion in the
                            United Kingdom might be impelling his government in the opposite
                            direction. Disclaiming any expert knowledge on this subject, Sir Oliver
                            stated that so far as he knew the UK position had not been changed, and
                            that he thought the Foreign Office views were based on three
                            considerations on which he would be glad to have our thinking. First,
                            without challenging our interpretation of the February 1 resolution, he
                            gathered that the Foreign Office felt that nothing should be done in the
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> as long as there was any hope
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> might successfully engage
                            in negotiations; in other words, <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>
                            action might be prejudicial to negotiations for a peaceful settlement.
                            Second, the Foreign Office wished to restrict the effects of the Korean
                            problem as closely as possible to Korea itself—that is, the UK would not
                            wish developments to flow from the Korean problem which would hamper the
                            build-up of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> strength or involve us
                            more deeply in <pb n="1969" xml:id="pg_1969" facs="0511"/>the Far East
                            before we were prepared for action there. Third, as a general matter the
                            Foreign Office considered that the United Nations had a dual function:
                            it was an instrument of collective security, but also an instrument of
                            mediation and conciliation. The Foreign Office, in this case as in
                            others, was inclined to lay greater weight on the mediatory function of
                            the United Nations than we were and correspondingly less weight on the
                            punitive function. This was particularly true in the light of the
                            increased possibility of Soviet withdrawal from the United Nations if
                            the Soviets became convinced that the second function was being
                            submerged.</p>
                        <p>In replying to Sir Oliver’s remarks, I stressed our view that failure to
                            carry out the terms of the February 1 resolution might well be
                            interpreted as evidence of weakness or timidity in Peiping and that
                            Peiping’s disposition to negotiate would if anything be decreased if it
                            seemed that we were weak or divided. We agreed that the Korean conflict
                            should be localized, but subject to that we were convinced that we must
                            do everything we could to impress upon the Chinese Communists that it
                            was in their interest to halt the aggression.</p>
                        <p>Sir Oliver then asked us whether we considered that our program would be
                            effective from both the economic and psychological point of view, since
                            he gathered that the Foreign Office was inclined to doubt its
                            effectiveness on both grounds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Barnett explained our position with regard to the economic
                            effectiveness of a United Nations embargo on the shipment of strategic
                            materials to Communist China. He pointed out that the complete embargo
                            applied by the United States had been more effective than Ave had
                            originally expected: it had, for example, in cutting down the Chinese
                            import requirements for cotton by about eighty per cent, impaired an
                            important sector of the Chinese urban economy (the textile industry). A
                            general embargo on strategic materials would over a period of months
                            have an increasing effect on other sectors of the urban economy, through
                            the denial of metals, medicines, and machinery for war production. The
                            trade statistics for February 1951 showed that existing restrictions in
                            Hong Kong were beginning to curtail Chinese imports. A UN resolution
                            would enable the Hong Kong authorities to justify their restrictions on
                            trade with China, and it would enable the United States, for example, to
                            approach countries such as Pakistan and urge them to cut off their
                            shipments of cotton to China. In other words, an embargo resolution
                            would enable countries imposing restrictions to make known the hitherto
                            confidential character of the international cooperation which exists in
                            applying such restrictions and would enable those now applying
                            restrictions to utilize this expression of free world opinion as a means
                            of tightening embargo <pb n="1970" xml:id="pg_1970" facs="0512"
                            />controls in particular countries. Mr. Barnett stated that he would be
                            giving more detailed information on this subject to another officer of
                            the British Embassy later in the day.</p>
                        <p>I continued the discussion by turning to the psychological aspect of our
                            embargo proposal, elaborating on the connection between limited economic
                            sanctions and the prospects for negotiation. I agreed with the
                            Ambassador’s remark that we felt we must make the way of the
                            transgressor hard if we were to induce him to seek peace, always
                            provided that we did not extend the conflict. I indicated that for
                            almost three months we had gone far to accommodate ourselves to the view
                            of the UK, and that we thought it was now time for the UK to come a
                            little distance toward us. I pointed out that our domestic public
                            opinion problem with regard to Korea was bound up with public support in
                            this country for our program in the Western European area generally.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, the Ambassador noted that all of our activity with regard
                            to the Korean problem was colored by the positions of the United States
                            and other governments with regard to the Chiang Kai-shek regime and to a
                            lesser degree the problem of Formosa. He pointed out that some of our
                            activities were regarded as measures to support Chiang against the
                            Chinese Communists rather than as measures directed against the Chinese
                            Communists alone. While acknowledging that this might be so, I made it
                            clear that in our view the first task of the United Nations was to meet
                            the aggression in Korea, and that any action with regard to Formosa or
                            the position of Chiang Kai-shek could only follow thereafter.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hickerson outlined to Ambassador Bonnet, who had called at <pb
                                n="1971" xml:id="pg_1971" facs="0513"/>our request, the US position
                            regarding the work of the Additional Measures Committee and our desire
                            for early action on economic sanctions.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the fact that the US has placed a full embargo on all
                            commodities to Communist China, Mr. Hickerson said that frankly we would
                            desire that all other countries do the same, but since this was highly
                            unlikely at present we were prepared, in order to obtain the widest
                            possible agreement, to propose or support a resolution providing for an
                            embargo on atomic energy materials, petroleum, and arms, ammunition and
                            implements of war, and items useful in their production. In outlining
                            our view that each country would determine which of its commodities fall
                            within the last vague category, he expressed the hope that the language
                            would be given the widest possible interpretation. Although the
                            countries would report periodically to the <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> on the implementation of the embargo, we did not
                            contemplate that the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> would, itself,
                            communicate with individual governments.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of timing, Mr. Hickerson, referring to the three
                            months’ delay since the passage of the Resolution, explained that we
                            felt strongly that there should be an early meeting of the <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>, on or about April 30. This would allow
                            next week for private consultations so as to avoid, if possible, public
                            disagreement with our friends in the Committee. We would hope the
                            Committee could thereafter proceed with reasonable speed and report
                            promptly to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> on recommendations for
                            an embargo along the above lines.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bonnet replied that he understood it to be his government’s
                            impression that now the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> Subcommittee
                            has agreed that economic measures should have priority, the Subcommittee
                            itself would proceed to study in more detail the nature and extent of
                            such possible measures. He questioned whether the full Committee was the
                            proper place for this. Referring to the general character of our
                            proposed resolution, the Subcommittee’s limited terms of reference and
                            the small size of the full Committee, we sought to remove this
                            misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bonnet referred to the feeling in many quarters that for the
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> thus to accelerate its pace
                            would put an end to any possibility of success of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> in bringing about a cessation of
                            hostilities. Mr. Hickerson stated that we frankly disagreed with that
                            view, held by the UK and others, and were seeking to dissuade them from
                            it. To maintain a normal pace in the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>
                            work does not at all signify that the <gloss target="#t_GOC1"
                                >GOC</gloss> has failed or should cease its efforts. It should
                            continue to try at any opportunity so long as hostilities continue. In
                            our judgment if <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> activity has any
                            effect on the Peiping Government at all, it will be rather a salutary
                            one in demonstrating the continued <pb n="1972" xml:id="pg_1972"
                                facs="0514"/>firm resolution of the UN not to give in to the
                            aggressors. Recent Peiping or Moscow inspired suggestions that the
                            aggression Resolution must be repealed before there can be a peaceful
                            settlement indicate that the Communists may be probing for weakness and
                            division in the UN’s position. What better means of countering than that
                            to move ahead in the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>A further advantage of prompt action from the public relations point of
                            view is to provide opportunity for France and others, in implementing a
                            UN resolution, to publicize some of the action they are already taking
                            through <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> to control trade with
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Bonnet expressed understanding with our point of view and
                            awareness of the impact of our domestic situation on the problem. He
                            stated he would advise his government immediately, adding, however, that
                            he was not unduly optimistic regarding their reaction. He felt they
                            would probably share the UK’s concern at the effect on the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>’s efforts and would not share our
                            “guess” that <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> action would not
                            prejudice the possibilities of peaceful settlement.</p>

                        <p>The Australian Ambassador called at our request for a discussion of our
                            plan for action by the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> in the
                            economic field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hickerson reviewed for the Australian Ambassador points which he had
                            made to the British Ambassador at an earlier meeting today (see
                            memorandum of conversation on this subject prepared by Mr. David
                                Popper).<note n="1" xml:id="d286fn1">

                                1968</ref>.</note> Mr. Hickerson said that we recognized that the 12
                            countries represented on the Additional Measures Committee each
                            encountered slightly different problems in working out the courses of
                            action they would pursue, but notwithstanding that fact we believed that
                            unanimity on our formula could be achieved. We would spend the coming
                            week in preparatory conversations to make possible a meeting on the
                            Committee on April 30 where prompt and unanimous action <pb n="1973"
                                xml:id="pg_1973" facs="0515"/>could be taken. Mr. Hickerson said
                            that he hoped the Australian Government could assist us in these
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Makin replied that the Australian Government would not find it
                            convenient to declare itself on the subject of economic sanctions for
                            Communist China until after the April 28 elections. Mr. Moodie added
                            that the Australian Government agreed, in principle, with the U.S.
                            proposals, generally favored priority consideration of economic
                            sanctions by the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>, but continued to
                            have certain reservations regarding the possible adverse impact of
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> work on economic sanctions upon
                            efforts of the Good Offices Committee. Mr. Hickerson replied that it was
                            our view that <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> consideration of a
                            resolution calling for economic sanctions would help rather than hinder
                            these efforts. We felt strongly that the Chinese should not be permitted
                            to gain the impression that the UN countries supporting the February 1
                            resolution were wavering in their determination to treat China as an
                            aggressor. At the same time, it was our view that whatever actions were
                            taken by the <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> should remain in existence and exhaust
                            every practical means to reach a peaceful settlement. Ambassador Makin
                            said that he attached great importance to this statement of our attitude
                            toward the <gloss target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Makin departed hurriedly for a meeting with the Secretary.</p>

                        <p>In our view Commie offensive in Korea has rendered obsolete much of
                            argumentation hitherto used by Brit and Fr in resisting our proposal for
                            selective embargo in <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. Altho we have
                            never seen any evidence of Chi Commie desire to negotiate with <gloss
                                target="#t_GOC1">GOC</gloss> on an acceptable basis, we admitted
                            that effect of selective embargo proposal on negotiations for a peaceful
                            settlement might be a matter on which opinions cld differ. Commie
                            offensive, however, indicates to us that Commies have no desire whatever
                            to negotiate at this time; in other words, policy of forbearance in
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> has proved a failure. What is
                            needed now is strong evidence of continued, collective determination not
                            to be intimidated by lawless use of force.</p>
                        <p>We believe UK and Fr shld now be willing in their own interest to make
                            public measures they are taking to cut off flow of strategic materials
                            to China. We note that Jebb himself alluded to UK restrictions in San

                            to gain from a proclaimed, collective recommendation to the intl
                            community calling for a selective embargo. This wld enable us to
                            increase effectiveness of existing controls by inducing other states to
                            apply them and to eliminate loopholes.</p>
                        <p>Altho we still desire avoid open split with other Dels it is our firm
                            conviction that time has now arrived when we can no longer continue to
                            defer presentation of our program despite their objections. We cannot
                            believe UN Members will fail to go along when asked to take entirely
                            reasonable action designed to facilitate attainment of UN objectives in

                            have underlain Dept’s policy of delay in <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> work since Feb 1 and are in large part responsible for
                            modest nature of our proposals.</p>
                        <p>We have, however, now reached conclusion that, damaging as a revelation
                            of disharmony in UN may be, still greater damage will be done if we do
                            not publicly take stand that UN shld adopt econ measures to supplement
                            mil operations against aggressors. We hope that when our proposals are
                            put up for actual vote, our friends will come to accept our view that
                            failure of UN to take such action will go far to destroy credit of UN in
                            US and other member states and will correspondingly reinforce Chi Commie
                            conviction they can successfully defy UN. This cld have serious effects
                            on whole effort to build effective collective security for free
                            world.</p>
                        <p>As stated <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 887, Apr 28, we will
                            expect full discussion our proposal in <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss>, although we cannot agree to dilatory tactics. If you
                            consider it desirable, we wld refrain from introducing draft res at

                            substance of our position. However, since <gloss target="#t_AMC1"
                                >AMC</gloss> members are already fully familiar with our ideas, we
                            cannot see how we cld fail to introduce res at fol mtg, possibly May

                        <p>1470. Re: <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. At Jebb’s request Ross and
                            Hyde met with him and Lacoste to hear UK instructions. Ross stated Gross
                            would handle item at May 3 meeting, returning from leave May 2.</p>
                        <p>Jebb emphasized the great importance which the UK attaches to a
                            declaration of UN aims in Korea “to which all would subscribe”. UK feels
                            this is directly tied up with question of any report from <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                            political comite. UK would not be prepared to vote for any selective
                            embargo report by <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> to political
                            comite unless and until such a declaration were issued. He understands
                            US opposes a declaration during a ChiCom offensive and did not dissent
                            from this view but noted offensive now seems blunted.</p>
                        <p>He suggested one main objection to US plan for selective embargo is idea
                            of vague formula with each state deciding what falls within it. He
                            suggested general debate in <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> or
                            sub-comite looking toward a short specific list of items to be
                            embargoed. Developing in detail US formula is too vague and subject to
                            objection by Asians. It could be clarified by debate. Hence US as
                            sponsor would have to give <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List
                            One in disguised form. He suggested therefore putting in <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List One at outset as basis for
                            short list comprising items clearly having direct relation to war
                            effort. This would avoid later difficulties for members in reporting. UK
                            would have difficulty reporting under US formula because some export
                            controls now in effect are to implement UK currency and supply policy as
                            distinct from Korean policy. Hence US formula would create UK operating
                            problem under <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List Two providing
                            quantitive controls. Lacoste agreed that a short itemized list is far
                            preferable to US formula.</p>
                        <p>Fact to be kept secret is restriction on exports to Soviet bloc. If short
                            list were used UK would justify denial of exports to Soviet bloc on
                            theory these exports might have ultimate destination PEC. India
                            (possibly other Commonwealth countries) presents special problem, and UK
                            would have strong objection to withdrawing open general license to a
                            Commonwealth member. UK would probably informally ask firms to refuse
                            Indian (or other Commonwealth) orders on evidence of PEC as ultimate
                            destination.</p>
                        <p>We commented generally that the US formula would permit immediate action
                            and reserve these questions for negotiation and the proposed permanent
                            comite. The advantage of the formula would be flexibility by allowing
                            members broad or narrow interpretation.</p>

                        <p>Lacoste questioned whether proposed selective embargo would be an

                        <p>Ross recalled Bonnet’s suggestion to Hickerson of sub-comite action and
                            stated that US opposition to this tactic continues. He felt US had shown
                            great patience in light of ChiCom rebuffs to Entezam and offensive.
                            Lacoste saw a serious risk of a division of opinion coming clearly to
                            light in <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>, whereas time might compose
                            it. He had greatest difficulty with idea of report to political comite.
                            He saw opposition to US program in <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>
                            by UK, France, Australia, Canada and Egypt. The sub-comite idea is a
                            sound face-saving device when members are hesitant to proceed in <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. He would be willing to debate these
                            various points in sub-comite.</p>
                        <p>Re sub-comite suggestion Jebb had no objection but no strong feeling. If
                            the US opposed tactic it would be impossible. Jebb projected <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> tactics as first a debate on sub-comite
                            report and probably approval. Then UK and others would discuss selective
                            embargo. He hoped would have first agreed on short list of items or else
                            general formula. This would take time. Then and only then should a draft
                            resolution be put forward. There would then be agreement on declaration
                            of UN aims. This course will in ensuing days provide some publicity and
                            sense of activity.</p>
                        <p>Hyde, speaking personally, wondered whether UK concern at stating
                            publicly and immediately what it is doing in support of UN forces in
                            field is not based on misreading of League of Nations experience with
                            sanctions. There the sanction was a political end in itself which UK
                            felt dangerous as leading to hostilities. Here immediate step is to
                            publicize with UN cachet action already taken in support of troops to
                            see to it our own forces are not faced with own material in ChiCom
                            hands. This is a basic supplement or corollary to a UN action. It does
                            not involve political decisions League faced with on sanctions. It is
                            part of the collective security function of UN as now operating. It is
                            parallel to mediation functions which we recognize should and will
                            continue. Jebb and Lacoste thought this might be useful basis for
                            consideration of US plan. Jebb attempted to state selective embargo as a
                            preventive measure rather than sanction in League sense.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Chairman</hi>: The business before us today is
                            the report of our Subcommittee. In that report the Subcommittee
                            unanimously recommended that when the full Additional Measures Committee
                            took up again the examination of additional measures to repulse the
                            aggression in Korea it should give priority to the study of economic
                            measures. At our meeting on February 15 I suggested that the task of
                            this Subcommittee would be to devise a program of additional measures
                            which would give support to the forces of the United Nations and help in
                            bringing about genuine negotiation and peaceful settlement. The numerous
                            consultations and exchanges of view which are mentioned in the
                            Subcommittee’s report showed that, of the whole range of possible
                            additional measures, economic measures could be most speedily agreed to
                            and most effectively applied.</p>
                        <p>Let me recall briefly what the United States itself has done in its
                            economic relations with the Chinese Communists. As things now stand, we
                            license no goods for export to Communist China, we prohibit our ships
                            and planes from calling at its ports or carrying goods which are
                            destined for Communist China, and we have frozen Chinese Communist
                            assets within the United States. We believe that this is a sound policy.
                            We believe that it is in the interest of peace and of collective
                            security and therefore is in the interest of all peace-loving
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>Several members of this Committee have already taken concrete steps in
                            this field to support the United Nations effort to weaken the capacity
                            of the Chinese Communists to continue their aggression in Korea. For
                            example, the Philippines has imposed a complete embargo on trade with
                            Communist China. Australia has imposed a strategic embargo. Our
                            colleague, Sir Gladwyn Jebb, pointed out last month in San Francisco
                            that the United Kingdom does not permit the export of arms, munitions or
                            strategic goods to the Chinese Communist Government, whose troops are
                            fighting against United Nations forces. I stress the fact that these are
                            examples.</p>
                        <p>I hope that as our work goes on we shall keep in mind the potential
                            advantages of a full embargo as an instrument which may help us achieve
                            our purposes in Korea. Such an undertaking, of course, presents complex
                            economic issues and administrative problems which are not to be worked
                            out in a day or a week, as our consultations have <pb n="1981"
                                xml:id="pg_1981" facs="0523"/>abundantly shown. The effectiveness of
                            economic measures depends on two factors: first, what the measures are;
                            second, how widely the measures are adopted. In the view of my
                            government, it will be more effective if most of us agree now to a
                            strategic embargo rather than having a smaller number of us agree to a
                            complete embargo. The United States therefore urges a program which can
                            be immediately and effectively applied on the widest possible scale.</p>
                        <p>The United States is strongly of the opinion that this Committee should
                            recommend to the General Assembly the imposition by all states of an
                            embargo on the shipment of war materials to Communist China. We have in
                            mind a formula which would call for the embargo of shipments to
                            Communist China of arms, ammunition and implements of war; petroleum;
                            atomic energy materials; and items useful in the production of arms,
                            ammunitions and implements of war. These are items which would be of
                            immediate consequence on the Korean battlefield. To cite only one
                            example, the denial of petroleum to the Chinese Communist armies would
                            have a serious effect on their mobility. We believe the formula should
                            be flexible: therefore, we suggest that this Committee recommend to the
                            General Assembly that each state determine for itself what specific
                            commodities it would embargo under this formula, and what controls each
                            state would apply to make the embargo effective. We believe further that
                            the resolution should recommend that each state would undertake not to
                            nullify, through trans-shipment, re-export, or enlargement of its volume
                            of trade, the effectiveness of the embargoes on commodities applied by
                            other complying states.</p>
                        <p>In our view, such a resolution should also create machinery to keep the
                            program under continuous review and to determine the effectiveness of
                            these economic measures. This would suggest the establishment of a
                            Committee—perhaps this Committee itself—to which all states complying
                            with the resolution would report periodically on the measures they had
                            taken. The Committee would review these reports and consider the
                            appropriateness of the measures taken in the light of changing
                            circumstances. By so doing it would be able to assist the General
                            Assembly to arrive at sound recommendations aimed either at increasing
                            the scope of the embargo or terminating it entirely if there were a
                            cessation of hostilities and a peaceful settlement in Korea.</p>
                        <p>My government believes that this plan conforms to the common interest and
                            would further the successful functions of the United Nations collective
                            security system. My government believes it is now time to record the
                            actions some United Nations members have already taken, to widen through
                            cooperation the scope of such measures, and <pb n="1982"
                                xml:id="pg_1982" facs="0524"/>in this way to support the activities
                            of the United Nations forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that any member who supports the United Nations action
                            in Korea will object to recording the determination that no United
                            Nations soldier fighting there should be the target of a bullet
                            manufactured in the free world. The program I have outlined does not
                            involve the problem of sanctions as it arose in League of Nations
                            experience. There the economic measure was an end in itself. Here the
                            situation is entirely different. The United Nations is already using
                            armed force. What my government now proposes is a supplementary measure
                            to ease the pressures being brought to bear upon United Nations forces
                            in the field. The program I have outlined is designed not only to limit
                            the fighting to Korea but to help bring it to a conclusion there.</p>
                        <p>Beyond this, we believe that to proclaim our collective agreement on such
                            measures will impress upon the Chinese Communist regime and their
                            supporters the unity of our purpose and our determination to repel the
                            aggression. We should not under-estimate the effect such a demonstration
                            of strength and solidarity would have on the forces of aggression.</p>
                        <p>The United Nations has dual functions. It is a system for collective
                            action to repulse aggression, and it is an organization for the peaceful
                            adjustment of disputes. One function does not exclude the other; the two
                            run side by side. Where they converge—where effective resistance to
                            aggression opens the way to peaceful adjustment—true collective security
                            may be found. It is from this viewpoint that my government views the
                            function of this Committee and of the Good Offices Committee. The Good
                            Offices Committee has unfortunately been unable to report satisfactory
                            progress in its efforts up to date. But we must not lose hope, nor
                            withdraw our support of its efforts, nor put it in the position of
                            having failed or of being no longer available. Action now upon the
                            program we propose does not signal failure of the efforts of the Good
                            Offices Committee or of the President of the General Assembly to find
                            the basis for a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>In the view of the United States, it is only firmness and decision, unity
                            and strength, which will induce the Chinese Communists to negotiate.
                            They must be brought to recognize that it is in their own interest to
                            cease their aggression. What I have suggested is a step designed to help
                            bring them to this realization. It is a step for collective action in
                            support of the United Nations forces and in support of the Charter. It
                            is a step, my government hopes, which may help persuade the Chinese
                            Communists to seize the opportunity offered them by the President of the
                            General Assembly and by the Good Offices Committee to <pb n="1983"

                                New York, May 3 (not printed) reported on the Additional Measures
                                Committee meeting of May 3 in which Mr. Jebb submitted a specific
                                list of items which the British Government recommended for embargo.
                                The list did not, Mr. Jebb pointed out, contain the item “rubber.”
                                (320.2–AC/5–551).</note> While we admit there may be some advantage
                            to specificity, we believe great difficulties of both substance and
                            procedure wld be created if UK proposal for specific list of items to be
                            embargoed were pursued in <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> at this
                            stage as substitute for present US formula. We wld, as Jebb indicated,
                            have to press for inclusion of rubber as well as other items useful in
                            production of munitions and for defining or broadening scope of other
                            terms such as “military vehicles”. You might point out to Jebb that,
                            apart from merits desirability controlling rubber, in view recent
                            publicity UK shipments, any specific list on which it was not included
                            would be subjected to great public criticism. We note Jebb feels that if
                            US insists on inclusion such items, UK wld probably prefer existing US
                            formula and therefore hope they can be persuaded do so.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if any suggestion for specific list were pursued in <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> at this stage we fear debate on these
                            substantive points might effectively delay for weeks UN action on which
                            agreement in principle wld exist, solely because of disagreement of
                            detail. US proposal is designed to work out detailed matters of
                            substance through review machinery provided in draft res, after basic
                            action has been taken. However, as possible compromise, we wld not
                            object to adding all items mentioned by UK as illustrative of our gen
                            category “items useful in the production of arms, ammunition and
                            implements of war,” so long as it can be made clear that the list is not
                            exhaustive. We doubt, however, that this wld prove more satisfactory to
                            UK than our general formula alone.</p>
                        <p>Dept wld oppose sug for circularization of members prior to UN action,
                            made by Holmes (Canada). We fear it wld entail long delay and are by no
                            means certain <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> countries wld wish
                            to communicate to other UN Members precise nature of their existing

                            to the proposed embargo list was submitted jointly by Australia, France,
                            the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. This amendment was
                            adopted by 45 votes to none, with nine abstentions. The draft resolution
                            as a whole, as amended, was adopted by 45 votes to none, with nine
                            abstentions.</p>

                            <p>“Dept has engaged in extensive consultations with Treas re nr of
                                problems arising out of presence of Amer missionaries and reps of
                                Amer business enterprises in continental China. On basis our
                                consideration these problems, Dept has reached conclusion that from
                                point of view of conduct of Fon affairs of US it wld be desirable
                                for this Govt to operate its financial controls with respect to
                                China in such way as to avoid hindering exit from China of Amer
                                missionaries and reps Amer business enterprises, notwithstanding
                                fact that operation of controls in this manner will have effect of
                                making available to Commie China some Fon exchange which might
                                otherwise be unavailable. It is felt that long run interests of US
                                wld be best served if steps were taken which wld have effect of
                                permitting these people to meet such of their obligations as wld
                                facilitate their efforts to get out of Commie China. An opposite
                                course might lead to such persons being held as hostages, subj to
                                extreme forms of pressure and thus further exacerbate existing
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>It is our understanding that at present time Fon Assets Control is
                                being presented with nr of applications relating to these persons.
                                One class of applications is understood to relate to Amer business
                                enterprises which have branches or subsidiaries in Commie China
                                having one or more non-Chi reps whose exit permits from China are
                                being withheld by Commie Chi. These firms and reps have outstanding
                                against them various Chi claims of one sort or another. It is our
                                view that at present time it wld be desirable for Fon Assets Control
                                to grant licenses in this class of case authorizing payment of
                                outstanding claims whenever (1) reps of Amer business enterprises
                                have applied for exit permit from China and taken all possible steps
                                necessary to qualify for receipt of such permit; (2) applicant
                                asserts to best of his knowledge and belief claims being made by Chi
                                represent totality of claims which will be made against persons and
                                enterprises involved; and (3) claims being pressed appear to have
                                some color of validity and represent more than bare effort to extort
                                funds. In accordance with usual policy of urDept on payments to
                                China, it is suggested that wherever possible licenses shld require
                                that remittances be effected through some currency other than US
                                dols.</p>
                            <p>Is believed that licenses under preceding para shld be granted
                                notwithstanding fact that sums requested by Chi are substantial.
                                However it is requested that any application to satisfy claim in
                                excess of $100,000 shld not be granted without further discussion
                                between our <pb n="1986" xml:id="pg_1986" facs="0528"/>two Depts. It
                                is our view that at this time licenses shld not be granted if they
                                wld entail taking of any action which wld be deemed by Treas to
                                establish any precedent prejudicial to overall Fon Assets Control
                                program.</p>

                        <p>Admiral Sherman then raised the question of a U.N. naval blockade with
                            respect to China. He said that 7 ships were on the way to China with
                            what might be called contraband. He said 39 Panamanian ships, largely
                            owned by Greeks, were engaged in the China trade. General Bradley
                            suggested that the best way to enforce the embargo was to get the
                            British to do so through Hong Kong, Admiral Sherman said that this was a
                            seamy business and that he was coming around to the view that an
                            honest-to-God naval blockade would be advisable. General Bradley said he
                            thought we should attempt to solve the problem in the way we were, if
                            that were possible; otherwise, additional measures might be necessary.
                            Mr. Rusk suggested the possibility of an association to enforce our own
                            regulations. Admiral Sherman said that he didn’t think this would be
                            good enough. One must make it bite on Indochina, the Panamanian ships,
                            etc. Mr. Rusk said that the U.N. naval blockade would not be possible
                            until after further political moves in the direction of negotiations had
                            been given a chance.</p>

                        <p>1606. Re <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. During course of
                            conversation with Jebb at end last week on Chinese representation
                            question he inquired with reference to the Admiral Sherman
                                testimony<note n="1" xml:id="d304fn1">Reference is to the testimony
                                of Adm. Forrest P. Sherman on May 30 and 31 before the Senate

                            further additional measures with view to taking them up in <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss>. I said we did not know of any
                            immediate plans in this direction. I expressed view that prior question
                            was whether UN members would agree to complete econ embargo. If not,
                            they would clearly not agree to blockade. On other hand, if they agreed
                            to embargo, problem of blockade would assume lesser importance, except
                            from standpoint of controlling Soviet bloc sea trade with ChiComs. I
                            added, however, that since we could not altogether foresee what might
                            develop in Korean war, in order to be prepared it would seem wise for us
                            to discuss quite informally at early date possibility of additional
                            measures. Jebb agreed that this might be good idea. Commenting on
                            Sherman testimony concerning naval blockade, Jebb questioned whether
                            complete econ embargo or naval blockade would not do “certain countries”
                            more harm than ChiComs. I indicated that answer to this question would
                            have to be determined by experts of our two govts competent to evaluate
                            probable effects.</p>
                        <p>Also at end last week Lacoste approached Ross saying that unofficial
                            visitors from Washington had indicated to him that the “prevailing
                            opinion” in Washington was in favor of additional measures along lines
                            Admiral Sherman’s testimony. Lacoste asked whether we contemplated
                            approaching them with regard to additional measures. He was informed
                            that we have no instructions to do so. On other hand, Ross commented
                            personally that we could not predict with certainty how the campaign in
                            Korea would go, nor could we predict that additional measures would not
                            be necessary. It might therefore seem part of elementary wisdom for us
                            to consult very informally together concerning possible further measures
                            in order avoid inevitable confusion which would arise should we fail to
                            consult and one day find ourselves confronted with necessity of further
                            action. Lacoste very readily agreed that informal discussion with us and
                            British would be useful thing. He said that of course naval blockade
                            would create very difficult problems for British but not so many for
                            French. He corrected latter part of this comment by saying his govt also
                            would of course consider naval blockade a very serious matter.</p>

                                that the United States not appear at this stage to be pressing the

                                effectiveness of the May 18 resolution, and it did not wish to

                                <p>Circular telegram 784, June 11 (not printed) was sent for action
                                    to 65 U.S. diplomatic and consular offices, and for information
                                    to 4 more. It contained a summary of the report which the United
                                    States was shortly to make to the U.N. Additional Measures
                                    Committee on the measures which the United States had taken in
                                    accordance with the resolution of May 18, and asked that the
                                    substance of the report be conveyed to the Foreign Offices of
                                    the various governments. The U.S. diplomatic and consular
                                    offices were, at their discretion, to convey the hope that the

                                    The U.S. offices were further requested to express the hope that
                                    those governments with substantial merchant marines would apply,
                                    at an early stage, adequate controls on the shipment of cargoes
                                    of materials to mainland China covered by the May 18 resolution,
                                    as effected by the U.S. T–1 order, and report on the same to the

                            </note> I stressed comprehensive character US controls going
                            considerably beyond May 18 res and indicated we would, of course, be

                            similar ours. With reference to shipping I emphasized extent of US
                            controls, confidential report we had received that shipping might be one
                            of ChiCom’s most vulnerable spots, and expressed hope that in their
                            reports other govts might find it possible to indicate they were
                            prohibiting their shipping from calling at ChiCom or <gloss

                            <pb n="1993" xml:id="pg_1993" facs="0535"/>ports or, as minimum, that
                            they were prohibiting shipping from carrying embargo commodities, this
                            as means of preventing circumvention.</p>
                        <p>Muniz expressed himself quite strongly in favor of complete economic
                            embargo and/or naval blockade. He said he thought such action might
                            become necessary as alternative to action against China such as “bombing
                            Manchuria” as means of increasing pressure on ChiComs without risking
                            spread of conflict. He said he had been much impressed by Sherman’s
                            testimony and wondered if we were actively considering naval blockade.
                            He made these comments in context of remarks to effect that since there
                            were no signs that Commies wanted peace it was essential to continue war
                            of attrition to point of Communist exhaustion. I told Muniz we were, of
                            course, studying carefully implications of complete economic embargo and
                            naval blockade, first step being, however, to make May 18 embargo as
                            airtight as possible and in this connection I reemphasized importance we
                            attached to shipping controls. In line with Muniz’ general theses I said
                            I thought first task of <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> was to
                            analyze and evaluate reports under May 18 res in order to determine its
                            effectiveness. Meanwhile I said I thought personally that members of
                                <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> should be thinking about <gloss
                                target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> program in general, and inquired of
                            Muniz whether he had given any thought to question of possible political
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>Muniz, in line with his general views, thought that consideration should
                            be given to political measures. He thought there would be no difficulty
                            concerning a ban on further recognition by UN members of ChiComs, that
                            withdrawal of recognition would be more difficult politically but that
                            continued recognition of ChiComs by certain govts has anomalies.</p>
                        <p>Muniz appreciated info concerning our forthcoming report as he had not
                            yet had even preliminary indication from his govt concerning their
                            report.</p>

                        <p>On June 15, 1951, the Acting United States Representative at the United
                            Nations, Ambassador Ernest A. Gross, presented the first report to the
                            Additional Measures Committee on measures taken by the United States in
                            accordance with Resolution 500 (V) approved by the General Assembly on
                            May 18. For the text of this report, together with those by other
                            governments, see U.N. document A/1841. For further reports by other
                            governments, see U.N. documents A/1841/Add.1 through Add.5.</p>

                        <p>Colonel Kavanaugh called this morning to inform Mr. Barnett that Mr.
                            Pinckard, Chairman of <gloss target="#t_Caltex1">Caltex</gloss>, had
                            instructed him to inform the Department that <gloss target="#t_Caltex1"
                                >Caltex</gloss> will suspend immediately further shipments of
                            petroleum products to Hong Kong. Pressure from stockholders on the
                            parent companies (Standard Oil of California and the Texas Company)
                            caused Rogers and Follis (chairmen respectively of the two companies) to
                            recommend that the <gloss target="#t_Caltex1">Caltex</gloss> Board make
                            this decision.</p>
                        <p>Stockholder pressure was generated largely by news stories published in
                            the Scripps-Howard press. These stories contained accusations that
                                <gloss target="#t_Caltex1">Caltex</gloss> was shipping oil through
                            Hong Kong to Communist China. <gloss target="#t_Caltex1">Caltex</gloss>
                            challenged the accusations and Scripps-Howard admitted its error. The
                            headlines had done their damage, however, and the parent companies are
                            currently receiving a considerable volume of mail protesting <gloss
                                target="#t_Caltex1">Caltex</gloss> operations at Hong Kong.</p>
                        <p>Kavanaugh believes that Pinckard, himself, regrets the decision.
                            Kavanaugh opposed it strongly on the following grounds:</p>
                        <p>The decision, in effect, imposes a company embargo on a friendly
                            territory;</p>
                        <p>It exposes <gloss target="#t_Caltex1">Caltex</gloss> to the charge that
                            it has been engaged in objectionable operations since the outbreak of
                            the Korean war and is only now correcting its error;</p>
                        <p>It may create serious difficulties for the British whose oil position in
                            the Far East is vitally affected by Iranian developments;</p>
                        <p>Its impact psychologically at Hong Kong will be bad, and may produce a
                            chain reaction.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Kavanaugh said that he was at the disposal of the Department if
                            it desired to pursue the matter, by receiving and communicating to
                            Pinckard the Department’s views, inviting Pinckard to come to
                            Washington, or otherwise.<note n="1" xml:id="d307fn1">In a letter of

                                Rusk stated that the national interest would be served if, prior to
                                the announcement of the decision of the California Texas Oil
                                Company, Ltd. to terminate its operations at Hong Kong, the company
                                could arrange to notify confidentially the British authorities at
                                Hong Kong and representatives of the petroleum trade in that colony
                                of its intentions. This should be done in a manner which would
                                minimize the economic impact of the decision upon the local economy
                                of Hong Kong and the adverse political and psychological
                                consequences which might otherwise be produced in this friendly
                                territory. Mr. Rusk further requested the Company, prior to
                                announcing its decision, to consult with the Department of Defense
                                for an opinion regarding the effect, if any, of the Company’s

                                <item>There are a number of countries—particularly Pakistan, Ceylon
                                    and Indonesia—where specialized regions and where individual
                                    firms might suffer financial reverse. Many of these reverses
                                    would be in the nature of a reduction in abnormal profits which
                                    have risen recently out of the East-West armaments race. From

                                    activity would be greatly depressed, so that British subsidy
                                    might be necessary, and in any event the community’s

                                    would have to be a substantial readjustment in the pattern of
                                    imports and exports. The loss of Chinese coking coal and iron
                                    ore would boost the cost of Japanese steel production, with the
                                    inevitable result that prices would tend to rise, including the
                                    prices of many export commodities. But alternative markets could
                                    be found, and raw materials in adequate quantities probably
                                    could be made available for Japanese import, although US
                                    allocations would probably be necessary.</item>

                            <p>While the total foreign trade of China with non-Communist countries
                                has grown rapidly under Communist direction, from a Western
                                viewpoint it is not large. Chinese imports in 1950 have been
                                estimated to be equivalent in value to $480 million and exports to
                                $400 million, with no area aside from Hong Kong peculiarly dependent
                                upon this trade.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">a. Loss of Imports from China.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>There are two measures for determining the degree of loss incident to
                                an embargo: first, the cost of losing Chinese commodities; and
                                second, the financial set-back involved in closing the China market.
                                With respect to the former, loss of imports from China, it is clear
                                that the adverse effects would be insignificant around the globe,
                                except with a nominal number of private dealers whose lucrative
                                trade would suffer, and in Japan where costs of production would
                                probably rise. From a global standpoint Chinese commodities are
                                “essential” only in the sense that they will do a somewhat better
                                job at a slightly lower <pb n="1997" xml:id="pg_1997" facs="0539"
                                />cost than readily available substitutes. China is the world’s
                                foremost producer of tungsten and tungsten is in tight supply in the
                                West, but the Communist regime has banned its shipment to the West.
                                The composition of Chinese exports is now primarily one of
                                agricultural products and textiles. Bristles, textile manufactures,
                                foodstuffs, tung and other vegetable oils, animal and poultry
                                products, soybeans, fruits and nuts, tea, and peanuts are the major
                                exports. Although some of these items are in high demand in the
                                various importing countries, none are indispensable.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">b. Loss of the Export Trade to China.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>With respect to financial set-backs which would be encountered by the
                                non-Communist powers in an embargo on China, only Britain would
                                undergo any real strain (because of its position in Hong Kong), and
                                only Pakistan and Malaya would be forced to undertake a sizeable
                                reorientation of trade. With the embargo limited to China, there
                                would be no general distortion of trade, nor serious payments
                                problem. As world demand is high for those goods which China
                                imports, the exporting countries would encounter no difficulties in
                                redirecting their trade elsewhere.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>In Japan the loss of the relatively small quantity of resources now
                                provided by China would result in some increases in the cost of
                                production, particularly in the steel industry. Roughly 25 percent
                                of Japanese coking coal and 6 percent of iron ore requirements are
                                now supplied from China, and alternative sources would be more
                                expensive, boosting the cost of steel production. In the present
                                world context, however, a rise in the price of Japanese steel, even
                                if contributory to an increment in the price of Japanese export
                                commodities, would not be seriously damaging. With world-wide
                                shortages of steel manufactures and machinery, the market for
                                Japanese exports is not at present sensitive to small price changes.
                                Maintaining an adequate inflow of coking coal and iron ore would
                                also be a problem, but not an insolvable one. The alternative source
                                for these materials is the Western Hemisphere, primarily the dollar
                                area. Since both coking coal and iron ore are in short supply, some
                                US materials allocations would probably be necessary. In the long
                                run, it is true that Japanese-Chinese trade may be of tremendous
                                importance in enabling the Japanese to meet international
                                competitive prices. But this thesis assumes a peaceful world will
                                materialize; meanwhile, the outlook for expansion of Japanses trade
                                is excellent, even without lowcost Chinese raw materials, though
                                realignment of Japanese trade would constitute a problem.</p>

                            <p>The British would have a serious problem maintaining their position
                                in Hong Kong. Inasmuch as the Hong Kong-Chinese trade is the
                                backbone of Hong Kong life (exports to China in 1950 were equal in
                                value to $258 million, or 39 percent of Hong Kong’s exports to all
                                countries), economic activity in Hong Kong would be greatly
                                depressed. British subsidy might be necessary; the community would
                                become more vulnerable to a Communist coup; and the likelihood of an
                                armed invasion would certainly increase when the value of the
                                community to the Chinese Communist became nullified.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Throughout Western Europe trade with China and Hong Kong is slight.
                                Even British exports to Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland amounted
                                to only $88 million, less than 1½ percent of total British exports.
                                Since some British products are consumed in Hong Kong, not all of
                                these goods reached China. The bulk of the trade covered iron and
                                steel manufactures, machinery, electrical equipment, nonferrous
                                metals, vehicles and vessels, and tires, for which alternative
                                markets could in due time be found. Statistics on West German
                                foreign trade last year show China and Hong Kong together as
                                accounting for 1.2 percent of total exports, almost entirely iron
                                and steel products and chemicals. Similarly, China and Hong Kong
                                received 1.1 percent of Belgian exports, in great part iron and
                                steel products. Swiss exports to the area, watches and other
                                manufactured items, made up 2 percent of total Swiss exports. In no
                                other country of Western Europe are marketing operations in Hong
                                Kong and China of measurable significance. Closure of these markets
                                would hardly be noticed in Western Europe, at least from an economic
                                viewpoint.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">5. <hi rend="italic">South and Southeast Asia.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>In several South and Southeast Asian countries exports to China and
                                Hong Kong represent a somewhat greater percentage of total trade
                                than is the case elsewhere in the world. These percentages are as
                                follows for 1950: Pakistan, 12.9 percent (January–June); Malaya, 4.2
                                percent (January–August); India, 2.8 percent (January–December). It
                                has been estimated that in the year ending August 1950 approximately
                                one-third of Pakistan’s raw cotton exports made their way to China.
                                Reports from trade circles in Karachi have indicated that Chinese
                                buyers are prepared to pay whatever the Pakistanis ask for raw
                                cotton. Hence, one may presume that a realignment away from such
                                trade would mean some diminution of profits, though there can be no
                                doubt that any exportable surplus of cotton can be distributed at
                                favorable prices in the West. The same is true of Pakistani jute,
                                which the Chinese import in smaller amounts. In recent years about
                                90 percent <pb n="1999" xml:id="pg_1999" facs="0541"/>of China’s
                                recorded imports of rubber have come from Malaya, and shipments have
                                increased considerably since July 1950. Yet, with a heavy demand
                                from the West, a closure of the China market would not be of greater
                                significance to Malaya. While Indian cotton textiles, jute sacking
                                and gunny bags are in heavy demand by the Chinese, these commodities
                                are also in short supply in the West, so that a realignment of
                                Indian exports could be accomplished rapidly and at small cost in
                                monetary determinations. The trade of the remaining countries of
                                Southeast Asia with China has receded to inconsequential proportions
                                since the collapse of the Nationalist government. This is true of
                                Indonesia, as well as other countries, despite a prevalent
                                misconception to the contrary.</p>
                            <p>Only quite small quantities of Indonesian exports, usually well under
                                1 percent of total exports, find their way to China. The large
                                shipments of Indonesian rubber to Malaya (including Singapore) would
                                be perhaps slightly contracted, both in quantity and value, if the
                                China embargo caused a drop in rubber prices in Malaya. But such a
                                contingency is not anticipated, considering the heavy demands for
                                rubber in Eastern Europe and the West.</p>

                            <p>The cost of closing the China market would be even slighter in Latin
                                America than it would be in Europe. A few very small exports of
                                Chilean copper to China, small quantities of Cuban sugar, some
                                evidence of Chinese Communist attempts to get Venezualan oil via
                                Hong Kong (shipment of Venezualan oil to Communist countries is
                                illegal), some cotton from Brazil, and coins and precious metals in
                                small quantity from Mexico—these, and not much else, have
                                constituted Latin American exports to China and Hong Kong in the
                                past two years.</p>
                            <p>In the Middle East, the only country to be affected in the slightest
                                would be Egypt, whose 1950 exports included shipments to China
                                valued at $3.5 million, presumably long-fibre cotton. This was less
                                than 1 percent, however, of total Egyptian exports. African foreign
                                trade statistics register only the Union of South Africa as having
                                trade with Hong Kong; its value was $2.5 million, less than ½ of 1
                                percent of the country’s total exports. No other African countries
                                are recorded as exporting directly to China.</p>
                            <p>Only Australia and Canada remain to be considered. Exports to China
                                and Hong Kong accounted for less than one-third of one percent of
                                total Canadian exports in 1950; for Australia the figure is a flat
                                one percent. Since both are countries with modern, flexible
                                economies, one can be assured that little if any difficulty would be
                                sustained from the loss of these markets.</p>

                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>In the context of current trade, the immediate adjustments
                                required in Japan as a result of a total embargo on trade with China
                                would be somewhat less than is implied in the subject report. Japan
                                has received considerably less coking coal and iron ore from China
                                thus far in 1951 than it received in 1950 and consequently has
                                already been forced to increase its imports of these commodities
                                from alternative sources of supply. On the other hand, the report is
                                perhaps too sanguine in examining the longer term outlook for
                                Japanese trade in the event that Japan does not have access to lower
                                cost raw materials from China.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The report notes that a total embargo would seriously undermine
                                the economy of Hong Kong to the point where a British subsidy for
                                the Colony might become necessary. Should this occur, the strain on
                                the UK’s financial position might be more serious than the commodity
                                trade data imply since Hong Kong currently is a significant source
                                of British earnings on invisible accounts (shipping, insurance,
                                profits).</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>The report contends that although a total embargo against China
                                conceivably might cause a drop in crude rubber prices and thus
                                adversely affect the economies of Indonesia and Malaya, such a
                                decline in price is not anticipated since the world demand for
                                rubber is high. In fact, however, the price of rubber has recently
                                declined and may decline further as a result both of US pressure on
                                the rubber market and British restrictions on the shipment of rubber
                                to China and the USSR. In this context, it is to be noted that
                                China’s record imports of rubber in 1950 represented only a small
                                proportion of total world exports of rubber.</item>

                                    China had been discussed with the British Foreign Office and

                                    prompt consideration. This was contrary to an impression the
                                    Embassy had gained formerly, when the Foreign Office stated that
                                    it understood the Cabinet had taken a very negative attitude

                                    present. The Foreign Office also indicated that the British

                            of that paper could conceive. Alternative (3) (page 5) represents the
                            mildest assumption made: that negotiations fade out without a clear
                            break, the Communists do not launch offensive or massive air attacks,
                            and they appear to be attempting a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> cease
                            fire. Even in that case, it is proposed that in the United Nations, the

                                nations to control their own shipping, or to agree to have UN help

                            at the aggressor, except in the case of a truly satisfactory outcome to
                            the Kaesong talks, would play into Communist hands. Tab C, a SANA

                                considerably more severe than those they apply to the USSR and
                                Eastern Europe. This is also true of French controls. The British
                                and French are reluctant to apply controls, particularly in the
                                shipping and financial fields, as severe as those of the United
                                States. Both countries are keenly aware, particularly since the

                                Communist China. Both must deal, however, with domestic public

                                    printed (493.539/6–2251).</note> advocating the adoption by Hong
                                Kong of a system of control over its exports to Macao, based on
                                export licenses which would be issued only if supported by import
                                certificates issued by the Macao Government. The British Foreign
                                Office agreed to request the Hong Kong Government to make such an
                                arrangement and agreed to a parallel approach by the US Consul
                                General in Hong Kong. The Foreign Office did not agree that the US
                                Embassy in Lisbon should inform the Portuguese Government of the
                                proposed agreement and of the threat of an embargo by Hong Kong
                                should the proposed license system fail. It suggested instead, that
                                the British <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> Representative
                                approach the Portuguese Representative there with a view to
                                soliciting their cooperation. The Department agreed to the
                                suggestion of the British Foreign Office and at the same time
                                instructed the US Consul General at Hong Kong to approach the Hong
                                Kong Government to make the arrangement suggested. Subsequently, the
                                US Consul General at Hong Kong reported that the arrangement
                                suggested had been made but reiterated its belief that no
                                arrangement <pb n="2007" xml:id="pg_2007" facs="0549"/>could be
                                effective which depended upon the exercise of control by the Macao
                                Government, and advocated the imposition of an embargo on US exports
                                to Macao. Action on the suggestion by the US Consul General at Hong
                                Kong is pending, in order to allow a certain period of grace, during
                                which it is presumed it will become apparent to the Hong Kong
                                Government that the fears of the US Consul General are justified. At
                                the end of that period we are thinking of advocating the imposition
                                by Hong Kong of some system of rationing on its exports of embargoed
                                items to Macao.</item>

                            <item>As an additional measure in effecting a strict control over
                                exports to Macao, the Department thought that the Hong Kong
                                Government should investigate a syndicate of smugglers, and
                                requested the US Consul General at Hong Kong to bring the matter to
                                its attention. </item>

                            <item>Apart from such control as Hong Kong could place over its exports
                                to Macao, it appeared desirable for the Government of Macao to
                                institute a strict control over its re-exports and transshipments.
                                On August 15, the Department accordingly sent a telegram for the
                                attention of the British Foreign Office, suggesting that the British
                                Representative at <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> might
                                bring this matter as well to the attention of the Portuguese
                                Representative at <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>, with a
                                view to soliciting the cooperation of Portugal in imposing the
                                necessary reform on Macao. The telegram, No. 925 of August 17,<note
                                    n="3" xml:id="d313fn3">From London, not printed
                                    (493.539/8–1751).</note> to which you have referred, states that
                                the Foreign Office has agreed that the British Delegate to <gloss
                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> will approach the Portuguese
                                    <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> Delegate as suggested
                                but doubts that any real progress can be made until <gloss
                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> convenes again next month. The
                                assumption mentioned in this telegram that the US Representatives
                                are also discussing the matter with Portuguese Representatives at
                                both Paris and Lisbon, apparently refers to the additional measure
                                suggested in the Department’s telegram of August 15. Up to the
                                present time, the Department has not requested the US
                                Representatives at Paris and Lisbon to approach the Portuguese.
                                According to Mr. Ainsworth, <gloss target="#t_RA1">RA</gloss>, it is
                                not believed that any approach through the vehicle of <gloss
                                    target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> would result in bringing
                                sufficient pressure upon Portugal to clean up on Macao. In order to
                                have Portugal take the drastic action required in regard to Macao,
                                it will be necessary to approach the Portuguese Government through
                                Lisbon but, in view of the extreme pressure required, agreement must
                                first be reached down the line in the Department. The Portuguese
                                desk appears at this time to have little interest in bringing the
                                necessary pressure to bear on the Portuguese Government. <gloss

                        <p>The issue on paragraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) centers on, in the

                            wisdom in considering at this point or intimating to the British and
                            French that in the period after an armistice went into effect and before
                            the subsequent political negotiations had been concluded, the U.S. would
                            contemplate suspending the UN economic measures.</p>
                        <p>The issue in (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) relates to the proposed
                            stipulation that on resumption of hostilities it requires a massive new
                            Chinese Communist aggression before the U.S. would seek further economic
                            measures. This is contrary to the position personally approved by the
                            Secretary as set forth in the “pessimist” paper on Korea which was
                            transmitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff two or three weeks ago.<note

                            May 18. British controls being applied at Hong Kong and throughout other

                            USSR and Eastern Europe. This is also true of French controls. The
                            British and French are reluctant to apply controls, particularly in the
                            shipping and financial fields, as severe as those of the United States.
                            Both countries are keenly aware, particularly since the MacArthur
                            hearings, of U.S. interest in stopping trade with Communist China. Both
                            must deal however, with domestic public opinion which is reluctant to
                            engage in all-out economic warfare against Communist China or any other
                            part of the Soviet sphere.</p>

                            the Kaesong talks would be merely an interim situation, neither reducing

                            affecting their military position in such a manner as to lessen the need
                            for economic controls. Accordingly, in this situation the United States
                            believes that the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Resolution of May 18
                            should be continued and that the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            and other countries should continue to apply to Communist China and
                            North Korea controls more stringent than they apply to the rest of the

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have formulated, from the military point
                                of view, the following statement of views on the Department of State

                            <item>In subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the statement of <hi
                                    rend="italic">United States Position</hi> an effort has been
                                made to distinguish between a cease-fire arrangement and a prolonged
                                armistice. It is indicated in that subparagraph that in the event of
                                a prolonged armistice, the matter of economic controls on China
                                would be re-examined. An armistice, as well as a cease-fire
                                arrangement, creates only an interim situation. During such a
                                situation any re-examination which might lead to relaxation of
                                economic controls would be premature. The relaxation of the controls
                                could grant gratuitously to the enemy an unwarranted military
                                advantage.</item>

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff would point out that whenever the matter
                                of economic controls on China is re-examined with a view to their
                                relaxation, questions regarding the mission of the Seventh Fleet
                                with respect to Formosa will, in all probability, be raised by our
                                allies. The Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that discussions regarding
                                the mission of the Seventh Fleet should not be undertaken in advance
                                of an agreement for a political settlement in Korea. It would also
                                be desirable for formal discussion to await a political settlement
                                of the status of Formosa. As the United States unilaterally
                                determined this mission, decision on the matter must rest solely
                                with the United States.</item>

                            <item>It is understood that on 4 August 1950 the Department of State
                                concurred in Chinese Nationalist visit, search, and seizure of
                                defected Nationalist shipping, if such visit and search were
                                effected either on the high seas or in the territorial waters of
                                Nationalist-controlled areas.<note n="2" xml:id="d316fn2">See

                                United States has generally overlooked numerous deviations from this
                                policy. It is not at all improbable that, after a ceasefire or
                                armistice in Korea, the British may seek reversal of the “tacit
                                approval” principle which the United States has adhered to. If such
                                a <pb n="2012" xml:id="pg_2012" facs="0554"/>reversal should be
                                imminent, it might be desirable for the Chinese Nationalist
                                Government to declare a legal naval blockade of the coast of China,
                                as had been recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff prior to the
                                aggression by the Chinese Communists in Korea. In this connection,
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff would reaffirm the view in their
                                memorandum for you, dated 2 January 1951, that Formosa is
                                geographically a portion of the Asian offshore island chain which is
                                essential to the protection of United States strategic interests in
                                that area.<note n="3" xml:id="d316fn3">

                                Staff, among other things, recommended that in such an event the 16
                                nations participating in the Korean campaign be pressed to support
                                the imposition of a naval blockade of Communist China.<note n="4"

                            language of the heading of subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) under

                            with the effect of treating both a cease-fire and an armistice situation
                            in the same manner. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> argues that
                            an armistice also creates no more than an interim situation and that any
                            re-examination of economic controls which might lead to relaxation would
                            be premature and could grant the enemy an unwarranted military
                            advantage. On this general point, <gloss target="#t_CA1">CA</gloss> has

                            in a paper which deals with UN controls seems illogical and unnecessary.
                            Furthermore, while the proposed sentence merely affirms U.S. freedom to
                            undertake certain measures, these measures are themselves contrary to
                            existing U.S. policy and reference to them at this time and in such
                            ill-defined terms is likely to arouse British and French apprehension
                            and might well lead to requests that we reverse what the <gloss

                                China, adopted under the UNGA Resolution of May 18, 1951, is
                                considerably impaired by the limited control exercised over vessels
                                trading with Communist China, including both those flying the flags
                                of countries which have supported the Resolution and those which
                                have not. Bi-lateral approaches to friendly countries have produced
                                results in some cases, but this means has now been more or less
                                exhausted and multilateral agreement is urgently required.</item>

                                could be enhanced by more adequate controls over the bunkering of
                                such vessels in ports of friendly countries. The two major American
                                oil companies engaged in bunkering vessels trading with the Far East
                                have adopted strict controls on vessels trading with Communist <pb

                                are often defeated by the lack of a similar control by other oil
                                companies or, in some cases, by the opposition of the authorities in
                                the ports of call. Bi-lateral approaches by the United States in
                                this respect have obtained only partial results and must, therefore,
                                be supplemented by a multilateral agreement.</item>

                                successful in transferring to the flag of one of the countries which
                                do not impose such a prohibition and thus defeat, in part at least,
                                the efforts which have been made so far to prevent the carriage of
                                such goods on those vessels.</item>

                                    <gloss target="#t_AMC1">AMC</gloss> meeting which led to the
                                adoption of the Resolution of May 18, consideration was given to
                                shipping controls as a technique to enforce the selective embargo.
                                As it was believed difficult to obtain wide agreement in applying
                                such controls, it was recommended, however, that, in the interests
                                of securing as wide agreement as possible to acceptance of the
                                principle of an embargo, the Resolution should provide that each
                                Member should apply such of its own controls as it deems
                                appropriate. The experience of the United States, it was stated, had
                                shown that where the United States considers application of controls
                                in particular cases to be of vital importance, such cases can be

                            Embargo on Trade with Communist China</p>
                        <p>The attached memorandum, prepared by Foreign Service Officer Harrison
                            Lewis, represents an exhaustive, well-organized, and well-prepared
                            effort. To my knowledge, no similar comprehensive round-up of the action
                            of the various States in compliance with the UN strategic embargo
                            Resolution of May 18 exists within the Department, nor am I aware of a
                            similar exposition of the actions taken by other nations pursuant to
                            United States approaches and to their own desires to control their
                            economic relations with Communist China. Mr. Lewis has spent several
                            weeks in collecting and collating this material, and the result is a
                            real contribution to the thinking of all who are concerned with this
                            important subject.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the substance of the memorandum, we have recognized for
                            some time the difficulties attending bilateral approaches to Governments
                            whose ships have transported or are transporting to Communist China
                            cargo forbidden under the UN Resolution, which <pb n="2020"
                                xml:id="pg_2020" facs="0562"/>United States vessels, of course, are

                                printed, but see the memorandum of September 14 by Mr. Perkins to
                                Mr. Merchant, <ref target="#pg_2014">p. 2014</ref>.</note> sent to
                            you shortly before his departure for the Far East, Mr. Barnett indicated
                            one of the problems in such approaches, the temptation to impose the
                            United States will on small and weak nations in a field where the great
                            Western Powers who are allied with us in the effort to stop Communist
                            aggression are not willing, and have not been persuaded by United States
                            argument or example, to hew to our line.</p>
                        <p>The reports of the recent conferences between the Secretary and the
                            Foreign Ministers of Great Britain and France again emphasize that while
                            there is no real division in our common resolve to resist Communist
                            aggression, there are real and basic differences in the views of our
                            respective Governments about how we should deal with the problem of
                            Communist China. While the United States Government adheres firmly to
                            and prosecutes as vigorously as compatible with good international
                            relations with our allies our own theory of harsh economic controls
                            against Communist China, and a strict policy, though somewhat less harsh
                            because of the realities of the economic situation of Western Europe
                            vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, against the Soviet bloc, we do recognize the
                            right of our Allies to hold differeing views. Our effort, therefore, is
                            to persuade the nations of the Free World that the common interest
                            dictates our making common cause in this field of economic controls as
                            in the areas of military re-armament and mutual defense planning.</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that Mr. Lewis’ paper attempts a middle line between the
                            stern and perhaps inflexible measures which have been widely discussed
                            for attempted imposition in the event of a definitive breakdown in the
                            Korean negotiations and the attitude which it is reasonable to believe
                            the British and French and other free nations of Western Europe hold,
                            that we should avoid increased provocative measures against the Chinese
                            people which will inevitably drive them deeper into the Russian
                            grasp.</p>
                        <p>This memorandum urges immediate action in the United Nations looking to a
                            further enforcement of the UN strategic embargo Resolution through
                            shipping controls, whether or not the situation in the Kaesong talks
                            develops more favorably. In that respect, it offers a proposal which
                            should be most carefully considered by those in the Department charged
                            with primary responsibility for the carrying on of relations with the
                            Western Powers. The proposal should also be examined closely by <gloss
                                target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, since its effect would be not only the
                            attempted shoring-up of the UN strategic embargo Resolution, but it <pb
                                n="2021" xml:id="pg_2021" facs="0563"/>might also represent, in the
                            eyes of many Far Eastern nations, a further advance toward a feared
                            all-out economic warfare against China.</p>
                        <p>Whether we would lose more in the often grudging cooperation of our
                            European and Far Eastern neighbors than we would gain in attempting to
                            deny more goods to the Chinese Communists, and incidentally in making a
                            gesture toward satisfying a segment of Congressional and public opinion,
                            may well be the final test for judging this proposal and other economic
                            sanctions proposals which will undoubtedly follow from various sources
                            within the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that this study, because of its intrinsic factual value and
                            timeliness, be widely circulated within the Department, and that
                            expressions of views be sought. It seems to me that some such analysis
                            and <hi rend="italic">caveat</hi> as this memorandum should accompany
                            the study, to avoid any appearance that <gloss target="#t_FE1"

                            anxious to volunteer economic warfare measures in order to better their
                            “public relations”.</p>

                        <p>On May 18, 1951 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a
                            resolution recommending that every State (both Members and non-Members
                            of the United Nations) apply an embargo on the shipment to Communist
                            China and North Korea of arms, ammunition <pb n="2023" xml:id="pg_2023"
                                facs="0565"/>and implements of war, atomic energy materials,
                            petroleum, transportation materials of strategic value, and items useful
                            in the production of arms, ammunition, and implements of war. The
                            Additional Measures Committee was requested by the resolution to report
                            to the General Assembly on the general effectiveness of the embargo and
                            the desirability of continuing, extending or relaxing it.</p>
                        <p>As of the date of this progress report, sixty countries had submitted
                            reports or acknowledgments. Of these, forty-two are generally
                            satisfactory. This category includes the principal Allies of the United
                            States as well as China’s principal non-Communist foreign sources of
                            supply.</p>
                        <p>Consideration has been given in the United States Government to the
                            status of the strategic embargo in the event of a cease fire or an
                            armistice in Korea, and, alternatively, to measures to increase the
                            effectiveness of the embargo and extend its scope if the Kaesong talks
                            break down.</p>

                            <p>On May 18, 1951, the General Assembly of the United Nations <pb
                                    n="2025" xml:id="pg_2025" facs="0567"/>adopted a Resolution
                                recommending that every State embargo shipments to North Korea and
                                Communist China of arms, ammunition, and implements of war, atomic
                                energy materials, petroleum, transportation materials of strategic
                                value, and items useful in the production of arms, ammunition, and
                                implements of war. This Resolution also recommended that every State
                                prevent the circumvention of controls applied by other States under
                                this Resolution. The action which this Resolution envisaged each
                                State would take unilaterally, represented a long step toward such
                                complete control, although such action would be narrower than the
                                position adopted by the United States in December 1950 when this
                                Government terminated virtually all economic relations with
                                Communist China.</p>
                            <p>A majority of the members of the United Nations have reported
                                compliance with this Resolution in one form or another, as have
                                several non-member countries. In addition, largely subsequent to the
                                adoption of the Resolution, many States recently have taken measures
                                going beyond the generally understood scope of the Resolution. For
                                example, Danish ship owners have agreed not to charter vessels for
                                China trade. Greece has placed in force a law prohibiting the
                                chartering of Greek vessels for transporting items embargoed under
                                the Resolution. Honduras prohibits all vessels flying its flag from
                                calling at Communist Chinese ports and from transporting materials
                                which might serve the Communist Chinese war effort. Italy prohibits
                                its public vessels (85% to 90% of its total shipping) from loading
                                strategic materials destined for Communist China. Liberia prohibits
                                vessels under its flag, except on written approval, from carrying
                                any goods embargoed under the Resolution to any place in the Soviet
                                Bloc, including China. The Norwegian Government has reported steps
                                to prevent Norwegian vessels from transporting such embargoed goods
                                to Communist China. The Republic of Panama, by Decree dated August
                                18, 1951, prohibits any vessels flying the Panamanian flag from
                                calling at Communist China ports, and Panamanian shipping to
                                Communist China has diminished greatly during the past month.</p>
                            <p>There are indications of a falling off in the total water-borne
                                carriage of Free World shipping of goods to Communist China.
                                However, United States authorities are aware of possible loopholes
                                permitted by transfer of registry and continuing trade by other flag
                                vessels, and studies are going forward on an urgent basis looking to
                                appropriate multilateral action within and outside the United
                                Nations to further tighten controls over shipping by friendly
                                nations. Increased activity by satellite shipping lines,
                                particularly Polish, complicates the problem of total supply.</p>
                            <p>There continues to be a substantial volume of goods shipped into
                                China. This trade still includes a certain amount of strategic
                                commodities, <pb n="2026" xml:id="pg_2026" facs="0568"/>but very
                                little consists of direct war materials. Increased smuggling has
                                followed the imposition of more rigid controls in Hong Kong in June,
                                including reported smuggling activities from the US-controlled
                                Ryukyus. The United States continues day-by-day efforts to observe
                                and bring to the attention of responsible authorities infractions of
                                their regulations by smugglers and others who attempt to evade
                                controls applying to trade with Communist China.</p>

                            Strategic Exports for China.</p>
                        <p>There are enclosed copies of an undated memorandum prepared in the
                            Colonial Office on the subject: “Hong Kong in Relation to the Embargo on
                            Strategic Exports for China”.<note n="1" xml:id="d323fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> It presents in a reasonably clear and concise form a
                            picture, as seen by the British authorities, of the steps taken by the
                            Government of Hong Kong to control exports to China, notwithstanding the
                            financial sacrifice which the enforcement of the controls has meant to
                            large sections of the population of the Colony. The memorandum
                            emphasizes the effect upon the economy of Hong Kong of the curtailing of
                            supplies for Hong Kong’s own industries which has led to inflation and
                            unemployment. It describes the hardships borne by these industries,
                            including many so-called “cottage” industries as a result of the
                            application to Hong Kong of Sec. 500.808 (as amended) of the Financial
                            Assets Control Regulations of the Treasury Department which prohibits
                            the import into the United States of goods processed in Hong Kong from
                            Chinese raw materials.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum pleads that application of these controls is such as to
                            cause serious economic loss and risk to the internal security of Hong
                            Kong and that therefore the policy of countries cooperating in the
                            strategic embargo against China should be modified constructively to the
                            end that the normal exports and imports of the Colony may be maintained
                            except insofar as they can be shown to be of assistance to forces of
                            aggression.</p>

                        <p>It is possible that the memorandum can be of assistance in the
                            discussions of the Hong Kong problem with other interested government
                            departments in Washington.</p>

                        <p>In consequence of the Chinese Communist intervention in the Korea
                            conflict late in 1950, the General Assembly on February 1, 1951, adopted
                            a resolution for which the United States had pressed which, among other
                            things, requested “a Committee composed of the members of the Collective
                            Measures Committee as a matter of urgency to consider additional
                            measures to be employed to meet this aggression and to report thereon to
                            the General Assembly … The new Committee, consisting of twelve of the
                            fourteen members of the Collective Measures Committee, became known in
                            due course as the Additional Measures Committee.</p>
                        <p>The United States took the lead in persuading the Additional Measures
                            Committee to recommend action. The United States Government’s general
                            position was that “the United States Government, in view of the Chinese
                            Communist aggression in Korea, should press for the application of such
                            international control measures as will be effective in diminishing the
                            Chinese Communist potential for military aggression and as will carry
                            the maximum weight of moral condemnation. Its efforts through the United
                            Nations and other channels should be directed to seeking, on a
                            cooperative basis, the application by the maximum number of friendly
                            countries of such controls for this purpose as the United States
                            considers would be in the common interest in fostering collective
                                security.”<note n="*" xml:id="d326fn2">United States Government

                        <p>On May 18, 1951, the General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending

                            areas under the control of the Central People’s Government of the
                            People’s Republic of China and of the North Korean authorities of arms,
                            ammunition and implements of war, atomic energy materials, petroleum,
                            transportation materials of strategic value, and items useful in the
                            production of arms, ammunition and implements of war.” The resolution
                            also called on every state to determine which commodities exported from
                            its territory fell within the embargo and to apply controls to give
                            effect to the embargo, to prevent by all means within its jurisdiction
                            the circumvention of controls on shipments applied by other states
                            pursuant to the resolution, and to cooperate with other states in
                            carrying out the purposes of the embargo. The complete text of the
                            resolution is attached as Annex 1.</p>
                        <p>The controls recommended by the resolution fell far short of the United
                            States’ own controls against Communist China and North Korea, which in
                            their present form had been in effect since December 1950, when massive
                            Chinese Communist intervention became apparent.</p>
                        <p>The resolution was communicated by the United Nations to 83 states or
                            regimes—60 United Nations Members and 23 non-Members. They were
                            requested in a provision of the resolution to report to the Additional
                            Measures Committee within thirty days on the measures taken in
                            accordance with the resolution. To date, 43 states (37 Members and 6
                            non-Members), including the United States, have made generally
                            satisfactory replies. Four states (3 Members and 1 non-Member) have made
                            replies which may be considered inadequate or evasive. Eight states (5
                            Members and 3 non-Members)—all of them Soviet bloc members—rejected the
                            resolution. Twenty-eight states or regimes (15 Members and 13
                            non-Members) have not replied, although six of these (3 Members and 3
                            non-Members) have acknowledged the receipt of the circular. See Annex 2
                            for a list of the states in each category. The 43 states accepting the
                            recommendations of the resolution, however, include all of our important
                            allies as well as the main non-Soviet-bloc potential suppliers of
                            strategic items to Communist China and North Korea. The extent of
                            acceptance of the letter of the resolution, therefore, may be considered
                            satisfactory. In general, it may be said that the embargo has had an
                            appreciable economic and psychological impact upon the aggressors.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of the embargo, the Department

                            prove a useful guide to them, and to express the hope that they would
                            apply adequate shipping controls.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that, although the United States has not sought United
                            Nations action to strengthen or expand the United Nations embargo, since
                            last June the United States has made approaches to a number of countries
                            to induce them, if possible, to accept and apply fully the provisions of
                            the May 18 resolution (e.g., Indonesia, Ceylon) or to institute shipping
                            or other ancillary controls as being in the spirit of the May 18
                            resolution (e.g., United Kingdom, Panama, Liberia, Greece). These
                            efforts have met with varying degrees of success.</p>
                        <p>June 18, 1951, was the deadline for replies from states to the Additional
                            Measures Committee regarding action taken under the May 18 resolution.
                            On June 23, before the nature of the collective response could be
                            carefully appraised and before the need for ancillary measures could be
                            assessed, Malik made the speech which led to the armistice negotiations
                            in Korea. It was reasonable, therefore, not to advocate any further
                            United Nations action to tighten up the embargo pending the outcome of
                            the armistice negotiations; any move to do so might have destroyed the
                            prospects for a cease-fire. Indeed, in the atmosphere which prevailed
                            during the summer, it was clear that the British, French, and others
                            would not have agreed to any such further steps.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It is in the interest of the United States to maintain the embargo
                            against Communist China as long as possible. Even if there is an
                            armistice in Korea, therefore, we would not wish to relax trade
                            restrictions against Communist China so long as its troops remain in
                            hostile and threatening posture.</p>
                        <p>The United States Delegation should take the position that pending
                            further clarification of the situation in Korea, there should be no
                            relaxation of the embargo. Certainly the situation in Korea will remain
                            uncertain for the duration of the Sixth Session of the Assembly in Paris
                            and there should be no relaxation of the embargo at this session. The
                            Delegation should point out that: <list>

                        </p>
                        <p>We should also make clear that quite apart from the United Nations
                            embargo and the threat of further aggression in Korea, the United States
                            is strongly of the opinion that the Nations of the free world should not
                            supply Communist China with the means for waging aggressive war.
                            Whatever be the status of the United Nations embargo, the United States
                            and other free countries may, and should, maintain or institute
                            unilateral or multilateral controls (e.g. <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss>) against Communist China and against the entire
                            Soviet bloc.</p>
                        <p>The views of our principal allies, however, are quite different. If an
                            armistice is negotiated, the British, French and others may be expected
                            promptly to urge the immediate suspension or revocation of the embargo,
                            perhaps without waiting even to determine whether the Communists are
                            faithfully abiding by the armistice terms and are negotiating in good
                            faith to achieve a political settlement. They will point out that the
                            United Nations embargo was imposed as an additional measure in support
                            of our fighting forces to help them meet the aggression in Korea. When
                            the fighting stops the purpose of the embargo will, in their view, have
                            been accomplished. The United States Delegation should resist such
                            pressure if it is applied by other delegations. The Delegation should
                            stress that, for the reasons indicated above, hasty action to suspend or
                            abrogate the embargo would be most ill-advised and that this Government
                            feels strongly that no such action should be taken for the time
                            being—certainly not during the time that the Sixth Session of the
                            General Assembly will be sitting in Paris.</p>
                        <p>Among other arguments, the Delegation may wish to point out that obvious
                            avoidance of haste in suspending the embargo would be an elementary
                            precaution against the possible use of an armistice by the Communists as
                            a <hi rend="italic">ruse de guerre</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The Delegation may also wish to point out to the French Delegation,
                            either to combat possible pressure from the French for the premature
                            elimination of the embargo or in an attempt to persuade the French to
                            advocate our view in discussions with the British and others, that so
                            long as the Chinese Communists continue to menace the Indo-Chinese
                            states it would be to the French interest for the United Nations embargo
                            to continue to limit supplies contributing to the Chinese Communist war
                            potential—granting that the existing embargo could not reasonably be
                            continued after the aggression in Korea has ended.</p>
                        <pb n="2034" xml:id="pg_2034" facs="0576"/>
                        <p>If, despite the Delegation’s arguments, heavy pressure to lift the
                            embargo during the Sixth Session in Paris develops, the Delegation
                            should consult the Department. For the Delegation’s information, it is
                            recognized that it may become necessary to compromise with the British,
                            French and others as to the timing and mode of removal of the embargo if
                            the alternative is a sharp split with our allies. If a compromise
                            becomes unavoidable, this Government would undoubtedly feel strongly
                            that the embargo should be suspended rather than abolished in order to
                            maintain the threat of reimposition if hostilities are renewed and
                            because it would be politically easier to reimpose a suspended embargo
                            than to recreate an abrogated one.</p>
                        <p>The embargo should not be allowed to peter out through a series of
                            defections, but should be suspended or abrogated, as the case may be, by
                            the General Assembly, acting on the advice of the Additional Measures
                            Committee in accordance with operative paragraph 2 (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) of the resolution of May 18, 1951. A petering out of the
                            embargo without United Nations action would seriously undermine the
                            prestige of the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">If an ambiguous situation respecting the possibility
                                of an armistice in Korea continues</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, the United States Delegation at the outset of the
                            Sixth Session should begin privately to enlist support among other
                            delegations for the adoption of ancillary measures to make the present
                            embargo more effective. The justification for taking no action which
                            might jeopardize the chances of peace, however valid last summer, is
                            becoming weaker daily as the armistice negotiations drag on.</p>
                        <p>The weaknesses of the present embargo are due partly to the omission of
                            certain ancillary controls from the May 18 resolution: and partly to the
                            noncooperation of certain states—particularly those of the Soviet bloc.
                            In other words, certain states (e.g., the United Kingdom) accepted the
                            strict letter of the resolution and have been complying with its terms,
                            so far as those terms go. On the other hand, certain other states (e.g.,
                            the Soviet Union and its satellites) never accepted the May 18
                            resolution and are seeking to frustrate its purpose.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the first category, for example, various cooperating
                            countries having important merchant marines (such as the United Kingdom)
                            are free to permit, and do permit, vessels of their flag to carry
                            embargoed goods from non-cooperating countries to Communist China or
                            North Korea. The resolution did not explicity proscribe the
                            transshipment or re-export of strategic goods to Communist China and
                            North Korea. The resolution made no provision against the supplying of
                            bunkers to vessels carrying strategic goods to Communist China or North
                            Korea; this has proved to be a matter of concern in connection <pb
                                n="2035" xml:id="pg_2035" facs="0577"/>with Polish and other vessels
                            seeking bunkers on their way to Communist China with strategic
                            materials. Any country is free to allow companies or persons subject to
                            its jurisdiction to insure or reinsure vessels or cargoes involved in
                            strategic trade with Communist China or North Korea; the availability of
                            British insurance facilities is particularly helpful to this trade. For
                            the types of measures which might be urged in this contingency, see
                            Annex 3.</p>
                        <p>The second category consists of states which have not accepted the
                            resolution and are not cooperating in the embargo. The non-Soviet bloc
                            states in this category (e.g., Portugal, Ceylon) may yet, perhaps, be
                            persuaded to cooperate and should again be urged to do so. Obviously,
                            however, the European Soviet bloc itself represents the most serious gap
                            in the embargo. Not only do the European Soviet bloc countries supply
                            Communist China and North Korea from their own production, but they are
                            in a position to transship or reexport to Communist China and North
                            Korea imports of strategic items from the free world. Furthermore, they
                            are in a position to supply important services, such as shipping, to
                            help defeat the purpose of the embargo. As a practical matter, there is
                            no way to compel Soviet bloc cooperation and very few economic measures
                            to hamper Soviet bloc economic assistance to Communist China and North
                            Korea lie at hand. It is possible, however, for all free world countries
                            to deny bunkering, port, and insurance facilities to Soviet bloc (and
                            any other) vessels carrying strategic goods to Communist China and North
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>The effectiveness of the UN embargo could be immeasurably increased if
                            sanctions identical to those applied or proposed for application against
                            Communist China and North Korea were also applied against
                            non-cooperating States. Realistically, however, on the basis of
                            considerable recent experience the US must recognize that there will be
                            little or no support for extending the embargo and ancillary controls to
                            operate against the Soviet bloc in Europe and against other
                            non-cooperating states. Annex 3 has been drawn accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The United States Delegation, in its conversations with other
                            delegations, should stress the point that these ancillary measures do
                            not represent an irresponsible, bellicose broadening of the United
                            Nations selective embargo, but rather that they are necessary to enable
                            the existing embargo to attain the clear objective of the May 18
                            resolution—the denial of stipulated categories of goods to the United
                            Nations’ enemies so long as the aggression continues. The United States
                            Delegation should not seek the addition of new categories of goods to
                            the United Nations embargo. If, however, contrary to expectation, other
                            delegations indicate in exploratory conversations that <pb n="2036"
                                xml:id="pg_2036" facs="0578"/>they would be prepared to support
                            additional categories, or ancillary measures beyond those suggested
                            here, the United States Delegation should propose more extensive
                            measures. This possibility does not preclude bilateral or multilateral
                            discussions outside the UN forum of economic controls related to the UN
                            embargo.</p>
                        <p>It is not believed desirable without a definite breakdown of armistice
                            negotiations or without the resumption of full scale hostilities in
                            Korea to endeavor to enlist support for a total United Nations embargo.
                            The likelihood of the acceptance of a total embargo by major friendly
                            nations in these circumstances is so remote as to make any effort to
                            gain widespread support for it unrealistic. The degree of United States
                            pressure that would be required and the amount of ill-will that would be
                            engendered in a serious effort to bring about sufficient free-world
                            acquiescence would involve the risk of a split in the free world and
                            would overbalance the advantages of a total United Nations embargo at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>In connection with recommendation B.–2 the United States has in mind, for
                            example, the possibility that Panamanian shipping controls, which
                            constitute an outright prohibition of the transit of Panamanian flag
                            vessels to Communist China and North Korean ports, will be rendered
                            ineffective by the transfer of registry of vessels now under the flag of
                            Panama to the registry of other nations which apply a selective and less
                            rigorous embargo. We also have in mind the fact that the failure of
                            other nations to cooperate in support of the Panamanian action would not
                            only render the Panamanian decree ineffective, but would also cause
                            considerable financial loss to the Government of Panama as a result of
                            its effort to take effective measures in line with the May 18
                            resolution. The sweeping Panamanian controls, which admittedly go beyond
                            the recommendations of the May 18 resolution but which are consistent
                            with those of the United States, were adopted by Panama as they offered
                            the only possibility of being effective, since the Panamanian flag
                            vessels are almost exclusively owned by other than Panamanian interests,
                            and since they rarely—if ever—come within the jurisdiction of the
                            Government of Panama. Accordingly, states should be urged to support
                            Panama’s action by declining, to register under their flags any
                            Panamanian vessel which seeks to transfer its registry after it has been
                            cancelled by Panama because of violation of Panamanian controls; while
                            under threat of cancellation for intent to violate Panamanian controls;
                            or when such transfer is apparently sought as a means of evading those
                            controls. The same principle should apply to the vessels of other
                            cooperating countries.</p>
                        <p>The broad principle of cooperation set forth in Recommendation <pb
                                n="2037" xml:id="pg_2037" facs="0579"/>B.–2 is not, of course,
                            confined to the re-registering of vessels. It applies generally to a
                            variety of controls applied by states to further the objectives of the
                            May 18 resolution, even where any particular national control measure
                            goes further than the action taken by others in that particular
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>As to United Nations procedure if the United States Delegation in
                            conversations with friendly delegations is able to lay the groundwork
                            for favorable United Nations action, it is contemplated that the
                            Additional Measures Committee would meet at Paris during the Sixth
                            General Assembly and would report to the Sixth General Assembly in
                            accordance with operative paragraph 2 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the
                            General Assembly resolution of May 18, 1951, transmitting an Additional
                            Measures Committee resolution which among other things would recommend
                            that <hi rend="italic">every state</hi> (not United Nations Members
                            only) take action specified therein. The General Assembly would refer
                            the Additional Measures Committee’s report (and resolution) to the First
                            Committee, after which the usual procedure would be followed.</p>
                        <p>The British have raised the question whether the Additional Measures
                            Committee will continue to exist after the Fifth Session of the General
                            Assembly ends. The argument has been put forward informally that the
                            Additional Measures Committee as a <hi rend="italic">committee</hi>
                            rather than a <hi rend="italic">commission</hi> ceases to exist at the
                            end of the General Assembly session in which it was created. The United
                            States position is that as no time limit was set when the Additional
                            Measures Committee was created it continues indefinitely, until it is
                            abolished by the General Assembly (which should not be done until the
                            aggression in Korea has ended).</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the British, French, and others will be willing to
                            adopt some or all of these ancillary controls by individual,
                            unpublicized action but not in the United Nations. In this event, the
                            United States might do well to agree to private extra-United Nations
                            discussions leading to the unpublicized adoption of ancillary controls
                            by the principal non-Soviet states and by the main maritime states. This
                            method is less desirable than United Nations action, since economic
                            controls secretly adopted and applied do nothing to mobilize free world
                            psychological forces, and there is no effective defense against public
                            criticism for not taking action which has in fact been taken. The US
                            Delegation should not suggest taking the unpublicized course of action
                            and should leave agreement on it to be reached elsewhere if
                            circumstances lead to its consideration.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">If the armistice negotiations are definitely broken
                                off or if full scale hostilities are resumed</hi>.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that this provides for what are, in a sense, two
                            separate contingencies. It is possible that neither side will accept the
                                <pb n="2038" xml:id="pg_2038" facs="0580"/>onus of breaking off
                            negotiations. For this reason, it is necessary to provide for the
                            possible resumption of full scale hostilities without the breaking off
                            of armistice negotiations. Recommendation C is applicable if either the
                            Communists or the United Nations forces launch a general offensive.</p>
                        <p>The United States has long since applied the measures which the United
                            Nations should be asked to adopt in these circumstances. The United
                            States action has not had the effect of spreading the conflict, and
                            there is no good reason to suppose that similar economic measures
                            adopted by others would have that undesired effect.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation C calls for a total United Nations embargo and for a
                            complete range of ancillary measures. The difference between
                            Recommendations B and C is that C calls for a total embargo whereas B
                            calls only for the continuance of the present highly selective embargo.
                            Under both B and C, the United States should seek the fullest possible
                            list of ancillary measures (shipping controls, etc.) except that assets
                            controls are omitted from B as being too much to ask of the British,
                            French, and others under B conditions in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Under “C” conditions in Korea (the determination of which would be made
                            in Washington), the United States Government will need to determine (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) whether, in the light of self-interest, any
                            exceptions should be recommended by the Additional Measures Committee in
                            order to permit the importation by the United States and its allies of
                            critical items from Communist China, or for any other specific reason,
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) what measures should be recommended by
                            the Additional Measures Committee in order to maximize the effectiveness
                            of the total or near-total embargo. This paper does not contain such
                            determinations as they will need to be made in the light of all the
                            circumstances prevailing at the time “C” conditions are deemed to have
                            commenced. The report of the Collective Measures Committee provides a
                            useful guide in this connection.</p>
                        <p>A United Nations total embargo, with complete ancillary measures, would
                            amount to an economic counterpart of full scale military measures in
                            Korea. In view of the enormous sacrifices, both human and economic,
                            being made by the United States in Korea, and in view of the patient
                            efforts made by the United Nations Command to bring about an armistice,
                            it would be entirely reasonable for the United States to press the
                            British, French, and others to accept the further economic losses which
                            would result from their application of a total embargo.</p>
                        <p>If a total embargo is unacceptable to a majority of United Nations
                            Members, including our key allies, the United States Delegation should
                            seek to have as many additional categories of items as possible <pb
                                n="2039" xml:id="pg_2039" facs="0581"/>added to the five categories
                            presently embargoed under the May 18 resolution. The United States
                            Delegation, after consulting the Department, should support the most
                            extensive list of additional categories and ancillary measures which
                            will receive wide support in the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>As to (1) UN procedure and (2) the possibility that others may propose
                            the extension of the embargo without General Assembly action and without
                            publicity, see the discussion of these points under “B” above.</p>

                            Communists maintain an aggressive posture, and nothing should be done to
                            assist the Chinese Communists to renew the hostilities, (3) the ability

                            Macau</p>
                        <p>Reports of personal investigation by our Consul General in Hong Kong
                            which have come to my attention prove in very thorough fashion that
                            there is constant passage of petroleum products into Communist China
                            through Macau. They do not seem to show that the quantities involved are
                            so substantial as to make Macau “an important source” of petroleum
                            products for a vast territory like Communist China, but they amply
                            establish the fact that the controls supposed to be exercised by the
                            Macau authorities are being less honored in the observance than the
                            breach.</p>
                        <p>In considering this undesirable traffic, one may wonder why it should
                            cause surprise. It should be borne in mind that Macau, a tiny peninsula
                            off the Chinese coast, is almost wholly at the mercy of the neighboring
                            mainland as regards the essential requirements of water and food.
                            Between pressure from the Chinese to obtain greater supplies of
                            petroleum products and pressure from the Western Powers for a strict
                            application of controls, the Macau authorities are, in these
                            circumstances, literally between the Devil and the Deep Sea. This
                            uncomfortable situation, rather than “bad faith”, seems the more likely
                            reason for the tergiversations of the authorities (of which the Consul
                            General has complained) in first denying, then attempting to explain,
                            and finally hopelessly admitting the existence of the traffic in
                            question. There are also the further facts that smuggling, to a greater
                            or less degree, is always a factor in the life of a border territory
                            like Macau, and that “corruption” in this connection is an invariable,
                            and so far as all human history goes, ineradicable concomitant of
                            existence in such places.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, realism would seem to require that anything like perfect
                            performance in the local control of this traffic should not be expected.
                            One may remember our own experience with the liquor traffic in
                            prohibition days. It should also be taken for granted that little if any
                            remedial action of an effective nature can result from <pb n="2048"
                                xml:id="pg_2048" facs="0590"/>protests directed to the far-distant
                            Portuguese Government in Lisbon, despite the expressed desire of that
                            Government to “cooperate”. As the Consul General has pointed out, even a
                            drastic shake-up of the responsible colonial personnel, which might be
                            dictated from Lisbon, could not be counted on to eradicate local
                            practices created by opportunity and connived at by custom. The only
                            sure way to exert control on what goes out of Macau would seem to be to
                            control what goes in.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, the Consul General has stated that “evidence of bad
                            faith” on the part of the Macau authorities is so strong as to call for
                            the immediate suspension of all permits to export goods from the United
                            States to Macau with the exception of those cases “explicitly endorsed”
                            by the American Consulate General in Hong Kong, and that “similar action
                            might appropriately be taken in the case of exports to Macau from Japan
                            and Western Germany.” If properly calculated so as to permit of
                            supplying only the minimum petroleum needs of Macau itself, such a
                            measure would undoubtedly constitute a remedy of some promise, though,
                            in the interests of good relations with Lisbon, it should not be applied
                            explicitly on the basis of “bad faith”, but rather as a cooperative
                            measure owing to the inability of the colonial authorities, under
                            unusually difficult circumstances, to exert normal controls effectively.
                            Furthermore, it should also be realized that any such suspension, if
                            made without adequate control of surreptitious exports from Hong Kong
                            and other sources, could be only partially effective. In this
                            connection, the Consul General has suggested that attention be given to
                            the “corrupt customs service” of Hong Kong and the possibility of using
                            naval patrols, and these suggestions appear decidedly constructive.</p>
                        <p>In sum, it would seem that a more drastic control of legal importation of
                            petroleum products into Macau, coupled with efficient prevention of
                            illegal shipments reaching the colony’s ever-active and irrepressible
                            smugglers, would seem the most likely way to minimize the relatively
                            small but persistent flow of these products now passing through there to
                            the Chinese communists. Furthermore, this could be done without risk to
                            our relations with the Portuguese Government if our actions were based
                            squarely on the cooperative basis of providing aid to the Macau
                            authorities in implementing a common policy. And finally, the fact that
                            such action was initiated by us would relieve the Portuguese colony of
                            any onus of blame in the eyes of their mainland neighbors, and thus
                            remove the fear of reprisals which is one of the principal factors
                            standing in the way of more efficient local control.</p>

                            <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: With respect to the
                            Department of State draft position paper entitled “Additional Economic
                            Measures Against Communist China and North Korea” (NOV D–4b, dated 31
                                [<hi rend="italic">30</hi>] October 1951), the Department of Defense
                            has several comments and recommendations to submit to the Department of
                            State for the formulation of a final position paper on this subject.</p>
                        <p>There is convincing evidence available in this Department to indicate
                            that a substantial volume of strategic materials and munitions continues
                            to enter Communist China from the Western nations. The Department of
                            Defense considers that such deliveries must be stopped. In this light,
                            the draft position paper appears to be too cautious. It is the opinion
                            of the Department of Defense that the US Delegation should be instructed
                            to seek much more extensive economic measures against the Communists
                            than are now called for. It should vigorously explore the possibility of
                            adding to the present embargo list and pressing for stricter enforcement
                            of the existing or amended embargo. The Department of Defense would
                            particularly like to emphasize that inasmuch as the aggression in Korea
                            will not have ceased until a political settlement is reached, economic
                            measures against Communist China and North Korea should continue in full
                            force until that time.</p>
                        <p>To carry out the intent of these views in part, the Department of Defense
                            would recommend the following specific deletions: (1) the last sentence
                            in the paragraph at the top of page 4<note n="1" xml:id="d331fn1">This
                                sentence read as follows: “In general, it may be said that the
                                embargo has had an appreciable economic and psychological impact
                                upon the aggressors.”</note> since it would appear to be an
                            overstatement of the situation, (2) the second sentence in the last
                            paragraph on page 4<hi rend="italic">b</hi>,<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2"
                                >This sentence read as follows: “For the delegation’s information,
                                it is recognized that it may become necessary to compromise with the
                                British, French and others as to the timing and mode of removal of
                                the embargo if the alternative is a sharp split with our
                                allies.”</note> and (3) the second sentence in the first paragraph
                            on page 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d331fn3">This sentence read as follows:
                                “The United States Delegation should not seek the addition of new
                                categories of goods to the United Nations embargo.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>For your information and consideration, I am including the following
                            comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this draft position paper:</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“From a realistic point of view, the fighting between the forces of
                                Communist China (satellite of the USSR) and of the United States
                                (including forces of the other Western nations engaged in Korea) is
                                    <pb n="2050" xml:id="pg_2050" facs="0592"/>tantamount to war,
                                with the scene of action confined to the area of Korea. There is no
                                assurance that the fighting will remain localized. Additionally,
                                among the Western nations the United States is now the dominant
                                power in the Western Pacific. Consequently, in any conflict of
                                interest arising between the United States and other Western Powers
                                which may affect the position of the United States in the Far East,
                                the United States should in its own interest insist that United
                                States security considerations in that area be overriding. In this
                                connection, United States actions with reference to the trade of the
                                Western World with Communist China should be guided by the realities
                                of the need of the United States to win the war in Korea.
                                Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the
                                instructions to the United States Delegation should be stiffened to
                                reflect the concern of the United States over the situation with
                                respect to Communist China trade.</p>
                            <p>“The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended that steps be taken by
                                the United States to obtain agreement among the sixteen nations
                                participating in the action in Korea to the imposition by the United
                                Nations Command of a naval blockade of the entire coast of China,
                                all in the event of a breakdown of the current armistice
                                negotiations. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that
                                the instructions to the United States Delegation covering such an
                                eventuality should be greatly stiffened and that the Delegation
                                should demand that a total trade embargo be imposed immediately. In
                                this connection, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the United
                                States should also call for, through such channels as may be deemed
                                appropriate, agreement by at least a majority of the sixteen nations
                                to a naval blockade.</p>
                            <p>“The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that action be taken by the
                                United States Delegation to insure the imposition by other nations
                                at this time of restrictions on trade with Communist China equal in
                                severity to those now imposed by the United States. This action
                                should be taken either in the United Nations or in extra-United
                                Nations arrangements to assure that the spirit as well as the letter
                                of the restrictions is carried out. This applies especially to those
                                cooperating countries having important merchant marines,
                                particularly the United Kingdom. The restrictions should be imposed
                                until a political settlement in Korea has been reached.</p>
                            <p>“With reference to the foregoing, and with specific reference to the
                                section of the paper entitled “Recommendations”, the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff are of the opinion that the aggression in Korea will not have
                                ceased until a political settlement is reached.</p>
                            <p>“Subject to incorporation of the foregoing views in the basic paper,
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff have no objection to those portions of the
                                subject paper having military implications.”</p>

                        <p>The United States position arrived at prior to the opening of the Sixth
                            Session of the General Assembly is outlined as follows:</p>
                        <p>If there is an armistice in Korea, the existing embargo should be
                            continued in full force for the time being, certainly as long as the
                            Sixth Session continues in Paris, pending clarification of the Korean
                            situation. If an ambiguous situation respecting the possibility of an
                            armistice continues into the Sixth Session of the Assembly, we should
                            press for UN action to tighten the existing embargo through such
                            measures as cargo and selective shipping controls. Agreement was not
                            reached within the United States Government as to our policy regarding
                            the strategic embargo if the armistice negotiations definitely break
                            down or there is a full-scale resumption of hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The United States has, with varying success, continued to approach
                            individual countries to induce them to accept and apply fully the
                            provisions of the May 18 resolution, including the institution of
                            ancillary controls in the spirit of the Resolution. The subject of a

                            revoked the mandatory control imposed on March 1, 1951 on the export of
                            these publications to the bloc. The General License is an interim one

                            experts if this need is indicated. The discussions, scheduled to begin
                            by the end of November, were to cover controls over sale of ships to
                            Soviet bloc countries, ships’ supplies, repairs, fittings, bareboat and
                            long term chartering, and carriage of controlled items in participating

                        <p>An approach has been made to Panama to secure the adoption of shipping
                            controls affecting the Soviet bloc (in addition to Panama’s present
                            shipping controls respecting Communist China). Although Panama initially
                            declined to institute such controls, negotiations are continuing on the
                            basis of recent information concerning certain reported transfers of
                            vessels from Panamanian registry. Bilateral approaches also have been
                            made to the United Kingdom and Portugal to secure the cooperation of
                            these countries in denying registration to vessels deprived of
                            Panamanian registry for violation of the latter’s Decree prohibiting

                            to reply to the letter of November 21, 1951, from the Acting Secretary
                            of Defense, proposing modifications in the position paper entitled <hi

                                and North Korea</hi> (NOV D–4b, October 31 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >30</hi>], 1951), which was worked out between representatives of
                            the Departments of State and Defense.</p>
                        <p>I note in the letter a reference to convincing evidence indicating that
                            “a substantial volume of strategic materials and munitions continues to
                            enter Communist China from the Western nations”. It would be very
                            helpful to the Department of State if your Department could make this
                            information available to it.</p>
                        <p>There has been recent agreement in the Coordinating Committee on
                            international export controls (<gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>)
                            to the British proposal for the addition of substantial categories of
                            goods to the China embargo <pb n="2054" xml:id="pg_2054" facs="0596"
                            />list. In view of this, there now appears to be a reasonable
                            possibility, if an ambiguous situation respecting the possibility of an
                            armistice in Korea continues (see Recommendation B of the
                            above-mentioned position paper), of action by the Additional Measures
                            Committee and by the General Assembly more drastic than we considered
                            last October could be brought about. I suggest, therefore, that a new
                            Recommendation B.2 be added to the position paper, along the following
                            lines: “B.2. The United States Delegation should vigorously explore with
                            other delegations the possibility of adding new categories of goods to
                            the five categories presently embargoed under the General Assembly
                            resolution of May 18, 1951.” Present Recommendations B.2 and B.3 would
                            become B.3 and B.4, respectively.</p>
                        <p>This Department is agreeable to the deletion of the three sentences
                            mentioned in the third paragraph of the Acting Secretary’s letter, and
                            it suggests the following consequential amendments:</p>
                        <p>Page 5, first paragraph under “B. <hi rend="italic">If an ambiguous</hi>
                            … ”, at the end of the first sentence change the period to a comma and
                            add: “and to explore vigorously with other delegations the possibility
                            of adding new categories of goods to those presently embargoed under the
                            May 18 resolution.”</p>
                        <p>Page 7, delete the first paragraph and substitute: “Bilateral or
                            multilateral discussions outside the United Nations forum of economic
                            controls related to the United Nations embargo are not precluded.”</p>
                        <p>Page 8, first paragraph, in the first sentence, after the word “controls”
                            insert “or the embargoing of additional categories of goods”.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary’s letter refers to a recommendation by the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff “that action be taken by the United States Delegation to
                            insure the imposition by other nations at this time of restrictions on
                            trade with Communist China equal in severity to those now imposed by the
                            United States. …” This Government has constantly sought such
                            restrictions by other states, but has encountered strong resistance to
                            the idea of taking steps as drastic as ours. The restrictions called for
                            by the General Assembly’s resolution of May 18, 1951, represented not
                            the optimum from this Government’s standpoint, but rather the most on
                            which an adequate number of free-world states would agree. The present
                            position paper reflects this policy, by stating as its first
                            recommendation: “In general, the Delegation should seek to obtain broad
                            agreement to the application of economic measures which will have a
                            maximum adverse effect upon the war potential of Communist China and
                            North Korea, so long as their aggression continues.”</p>
                        <p>No action which our Delegation could take would “insure”, as the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff recommend, the imposition by others of the type <pb
                                n="2055" xml:id="pg_2055" facs="0597"/>of trade restrictions which
                            we ourselves have imposed. The instructions furnished to our Delegation
                            do, however, call on it to take such steps as are calculated to persuade
                            other states to move as far as possible toward our own position with
                            respect to trade restrictions against Communist China and North
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the comments on this position paper of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff, quoted in your letter, concerning this Government’s position with
                            respect to economic measures against Communist China and North Korea in
                            the event that armistice negotiations definitely break down or there is
                            a full-scale resumption of hostilities, this question is now being
                            determined by the National Security Council. Its determination will, of
                            course, be reflected in any necessary amendments to the position paper.
                            In this connection, I might point out that, owing to the objection of
                            the Economic Cooperation Administration, Recommendation C of the
                            position paper (and the corresponding section of the discussion) did not
                            receive full inter-agency clearance and has not been furnished to the
                            United States Delegation to the Sixth General Assembly for its guidance.
                            Recommendations A and B, together with the corresponding discussion
                            sections, however, were furnished to our Delegation for appropriate
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
