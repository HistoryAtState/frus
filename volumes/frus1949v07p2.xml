                <p>Part 2 of this volume was prepared under the direct supervision of the late S.
                    Everett Gleason, editor of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> until 1972,
                    and of Fredrick Aandahl, who succeeded him.</p>
                <p>Documentation on regional policies and on Japan was compiled by John G. Reid;
                    that on Korea by John P. Glennon.</p>
                <p>The editors acknowledge with appreciation the assistance provided them by the
                    historians of the Department of Defense, including those of the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff. They are also grateful for the cooperation of the National Security
                    Council, the Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency, all of
                    which concurred with the declassification of various papers for release herein.
                    Thanks are also due to those foreign governments that kindly granted permission
                    for the publication of certain of their documents in this volume.</p>
                <p>The technical editing of this volume was done by the Publishing and Reproduction
                    Division, headed by Willard M. McLaughlin. The index for part 2 was prepared by
                    Francis C. Prescott.</p>
                <p>Part 1 of this volume, released in 1975 as Department of State publication 8797,
                    contained documentation on Australia and New Zealand, Indochina, Indonesia, and
                    the Philippines.</p>

                        1925, by Mr. Frank B. Kellogg, then Secretary of State. The text of the

                        constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States.
                        These volumes include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                        documents <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0008"/>needed to give a
                        comprehensive record of the major foreign policy decisions within the range
                        of the Department of State’s responsibilities, together with appropriate
                        materials concerning the facts which contributed to the formulation of
                        policies. When further material is needed to supplement the documentation in
                        the Department’s files for a proper understanding of the relevant policies
                        of the United States, such papers should be obtained from other Government
                        agencies.</p>

                    <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record to be printed in <hi rend="italic"
                            >Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the Historical
                        Office, Bureau of Public Affairs of the Department of State. The editing of
                        the record is guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There may
                        be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the
                        text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                        importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                        concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                        policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the

                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“From a political standpoint, I do not regard the immediately
                                    potential Communist threat to Japan as much more than a nuisance
                                    factor. The Communist representation in the National Diet must
                                    increase many fold before its voice in legislative affairs
                                    becomes politically effective, an increase not likely at least
                                    in the foreseeable future. Traditionally, the Japanese are
                                    conservative and they have long held the Russian, in dislike and
                                    the Chinese in contempt, and are not likely voluntarily to
                                    follow the ideological leadership of either. In addition, from a
                                    sociological standpoint, the threat of the spread of Communism
                                    through the farm masses, once hinging upon the feudalistic
                                    system of farm tenancy, has now been effectively removed through
                                    the land reforms which have elevated the individual farmer
                                    families to the dignity of proprietary ownership and worked out
                                    an effective system of farm cooperatives, leaving no fertile
                                    ground for the Communists to work upon in this large and
                                    powerful rural area of Japanese society comprising approximately
                                    one-half of the population. Other areas, save that of industrial
                                    labor, are similarly fortified against Communist invasion,
                                    either through natural and traditional conservatism or through
                                    advantages now held which stand up against anything which the
                                    Communists offer. With industrial labor, the situation is
                                    different. Its very immaturity in organized reform renders it
                                    easy prey to leadership which offers a wealth-sharing panacea to
                                    existing impoverishment, however unsound the promise. The
                                    potential danger to every other segment of Japanese society from
                                    a Communist-controlled <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0016"
                                    />labor movement would be very real and immediate. This is well
                                    known to the Communist Party which, as a result, has devoted
                                    almost its entire effort to its infiltration to a dominant
                                    position of labor leadership. The numerical weakness of the
                                    Communist membership does not permit even this effort to extend
                                    over a broad labor front, and as a consequence its tactic has
                                    been to concentrate upon those segments of labor most vital to
                                    political and economic stability. It thus sought to seize
                                    control of the two great government unions, communications and
                                    transportation, which would have permitted it almost at will to
                                    paralyze those vital arteries to Japanese life. This move was
                                    effectively blocked by action to place the public service on
                                    more stable ground through the enactment of laws prohibiting the

                                    to support the general welfare with, of course, the dominant
                                    influence which an occupation requirement and leadership

                                <p>“I do not view with concern talk of a ‘popular front’ in Japan.
                                    So far such talk has been entirely confined to the Communist
                                    Party and its affiliates. A splinter group from the left wing of
                                    the Social Democratic Party may possibly join with the
                                    Communists in the course of or immediately following the coming
                                    election, as there is already great similarity in political
                                    philosophy and tactic, but the resulting coalition would be of
                                    little political consequence. On the other hand, such a move
                                    would leave the Social Democratic Party, cleansed of its most
                                    unruly and troublesome element, in an infinitely stronger
                                    position to contribute objectively to the country’s need, either
                                    as an opposition party or segment of a government coalition.
                                    This party should more properly be named as the ‘Labor Party’,
                                    as organized and led by outstanding labor leaders and finding
                                    most of its support in the ranks of labor, its advocacy of
                                    Socialism is at most a long range advocacy and its immediate
                                    purpose is to support legislation of direct labor interest.
                                    Apart from its radical left wing mentioned, it is fundamentally
                                    more conservative than conventional Socialism and is openly
                                    opposed to the extreme of either the right or the left.</p>
                                <p>“The greatest boost for the spread of Communism in Japan lies in
                                    the ammunition which from time to time is supplied its local
                                    leadership through thoughtless and irresponsible press
                                    statements emanating largely from Washington correspondents
                                    which instill doubt in the Japanese mind that Washington
                                    official opinion is in harmony with occupation objectives and
                                    action. Such statements, usually ascribed to anonymous official
                                    sources frequently give real encouragement to the local
                                    Communist leaders and bewilder the Japanese masses.
                                    Intentionally or not, they are not infrequently timed and
                                    phrased to checkmate local efforts to ensure the vigorous
                                    implementation by the Japanese of American policy and almost
                                    invariably lend aid to the Communist propaganda effort. I am
                                    only now bringing a glaring example of this condition to the

                                <p>“There is little that should be done [not] now being done here to
                                    check the advance of Communism, but should the threat in future
                                    become greatly aggravated or should such a common front become a
                                    threatening reality, I should, of course, search for a legal
                                    means to apply direct pressure which I have heretofore avoided
                                    as inadvisable and unnecessary. In final analysis, were
                                    injudicious statements in Washington, oft-times made to woo
                                    American pressure groups avoided and a more positive show of
                                    support given the occupation, overwhelming of the Communist
                                    movement in Japan through its complete repudiation by the

                                President Truman and Secretary Byrnes when the Far Eastern

                                has seemed to me increasingly, however, that these instructions are
                                less well adapted to the current international situation and <pb

                                were to the more hopeful situation prevailing when they were issued.
                                The Soviet Representative on the Far Eastern Commission has adopted
                                a steadily more aggressive attitude in Commission meetings, has
                                abused the generally accepted privacy of the meetings, and has
                                submitted a number of policy proposals which have had little or no

                                based upon the fact that the commission’s broad policy-making
                                functions have been substantially carried out. General McCoy’s
                                second instruction, therefore, is that he endeavor to impress upon
                                the Commission on appropriate occasions the desirability of its
                                confining further policy directives to those required, generally, in

                                    not printed.</note> of conversation between an officer of this
                                Mission and Mr. Ichimada Hisato, Governor of the Bank of Japan, and
                                Mr. Ishikawa Ichiro, President of the Japan Economic Federation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ichimada expressed considerable concern over what he believes is
                                unnecessary intervention in Japanese politics by General
                                Headquarters during the third and fourth sessions of the National
                                Diet. Mr. Ichimada said that he is fully aware of the right of
                                General Headquarters to intervene at any length in Japanese affairs
                                under the terms of the Instrument of Surrender, but he expressed the
                                belief that the manner in which intervention has been carried out in
                                recent months has been ill-advised and tends to slow down the
                                desirable development of democratic processes in Japan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ichimada referred particularly to General Headquarters
                                intervention in connection with the wage bill, where apparently
                                Headquarters support of the Cabinet’s proposed 5,300 yen base wage
                                was suddenly withdrawn near the end of the last session of the Diet
                                in favor of a 6,300 yen base advocated by the opposition parties and
                                favored by the National Personnel Authority. This action, according
                                to Mr. Ichimada, was taken without warning and left Prime Minister
                                Yoshida in a most untenable position in which he was compelled to
                                reconsider at the last moment complicated budget estimates in order
                                to meet the demands of the higher base wage. Mr. Ichimada cited
                                other examples in which he feels the Cabinet’s position has been
                                adversely affected by intervention in connection with the drafting
                                and passage of the National Public Service Law, and the question of
                                the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of a general
                                election.</p>
                            <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0020"/>
                            <p>In Mr. Ichimada’s opinion, democratic, parliamentary government
                                cannot develop satisfactorily in Japan if parliamentary processes
                                are frequently subject to outside interference. If it is necessary
                                to take such extreme measures because of critical or emergency
                                conditions, Mr. Ichimada expressed the belief that it might be
                                better in the long run and certainly more efficient to suspend
                                temporarily parliamentary processes of government and govern Japan
                                solely through General Headquarters directives. Not only does
                                outside intervention retard democratic development, but Mr. Ichimada
                                also pointed out that such action tends to discourage able and
                                responsible men from participation in political activity. Mr.
                                Ichimada stated that he is convinced that recent acts of
                                intervention were deliberately intended to weaken Prime Minister
                                Yoshida’s position because of his unpopularity with some sections of
                                General Headquarters and his allegedly reactionary views.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ichimada expressed himself with unusual frankness for an official
                                in his position, which is believed indicative of the degree to which
                                he has become concerned over this matter. Mr. Ishikawa fully shares
                                Mr. Ichimada’s views, and it is believed that most responsible
                                Japanese leaders in government, finance, and business are equally
                                concerned over this question. The role of a political force
                                operating outside the constitutional framework of the government is
                                not new to Japan. The Japanese are thoroughly familiar with the
                                operation of extra-constitutional political pressures, and one of
                                the fundamental lessons the Occupation has attempted to teach the
                                Japanese is the serious extent to which such outside pressure
                                jeopardizes the growth of real democracy. While there can be no
                                denial of the supreme position of General Headquarters under the
                                terms of surrender, it would seem desirable that the exercise of
                                this supreme power be directed in a manner best calculated to
                                promote democratic government rather than in a manner which appears
                                to many Japanese to be identical with the undesirable
                                extra-constitutional pressures experienced before the surrender. As
                                Mr. Ichimada emphasized, the situation may be critical enough to
                                warrant direct intervention, but if this is necessary, an effort
                                should be made to clarify the need for such intervention, to
                                regularize its application so as to avoid the confusion which has
                                been occasioned by different sections of General Headquarters making
                                conflicting demands, and to avoid giving the impression that we
                                merely desire the form of democratic government without its actual
                                substance.</p>
                            <p>It is also believed that another serious aspect of this question is
                                the manner in which outside intervention has tended to discredit and
                                undermine the position of the present government. It appears more
                                than coincidental that the frequency of such intervention has
                                increased during the tenure of the Yoshida Cabinet, for there is
                                little doubt of Mr. Yoshida’s unpopularity among some sections of
                                General Headquarters. <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0021"/>The
                                Prime Minister’s conservative attitude, his refusal to participate
                                in a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party in 1947,
                                his insistent demands for an election, and his general effort to
                                resist advice and pressure from General Headquarters have made Mr.
                                Yoshida unpopular and the subject of criticism. Intervention,
                                however, not only undermines Mr. Yoshida’s position, but in the
                                present political situation primarily benefits the extreme left. As
                                discussed at length in this Mission’s despatch No. 813, the broad
                                socialist middle group, from which we believe it would be desirable
                                for a genuine labor party to emerge, is at present disintegrating.
                                Much of this disintegration is represented by an increasingly large
                                movement of left-wing socialists into the communist party. The
                                extreme left wing in Japanese politics is therefore gaining strength
                                at the expense of the more stabilizing middle element, while the
                                conservative forces are being undermined by the intervention of
                                General Headquarters.</p>
                            <p>While discounting certain of the points reflected in Mr. Ichimada’s
                                comments, this Mission does wish to emphasize its concurrence in the
                                view that Headquarters’ action vis-à-vis the Yoshida Government in a
                                number of instances may well work to our long-term disadvantage. It
                                is our belief that the most desirable and practicable pattern for
                                democratic development in Japanese political life rests in a change
                                of governments between a conservative party and a labor party as
                                their majorities fluctuate in the National Diet, with the communist
                                groupings at the extreme left remaining always a small minority. At
                                the present stage of Japanese political development, however, there
                                appears a tendency toward alignment between the extreme right and
                                the extreme left. The more conservative elements are endeavoring to
                                form a single conservative party, while the communists are exerting
                                formidable leadership to organize an extreme leftist group. The
                                important middle political area, from which a future labor party
                                should develop, is unfortunately in a state of disorganization and
                                disintegration.</p>
                            <p>In these circumstances, the intrusions by General Headquarters into
                                Japanese politics can cause a particularly undesirable effect.
                                Without the presence of a strong, sound labor party to serve as a
                                political balance wheel to the conservative forces now represented
                                by the Democratic-Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, we should
                                avoid weakening the conservative position at a time when the only
                                element which can profit by this action is the extreme left under
                                communist leadership. Such intervention therefore is thus far having
                                the effect of building up a communist-organized left as the only
                                effective counterweight to the conservative right.</p>

                            <p>With reference to our conversation this morning I am attaching a
                                memorandum on Japanese reparations.<note n="1" xml:id="d4fn1">Not

                                merits rather exhaustive treatment.</p>
                            <p>Personally I remain convinced that the position recommended by
                                General MacArthur in his last telegram on this subject (C–66288,
                                December 14<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">Not printed, but see

                                position which the United States can best defend, which will in the
                                long run cause the least bitter disappointment to friendly
                                countries, which is in the best interest of the United States, which
                                will be most acceptable to Congress and to the American people, and
                                which, for all of these reasons, we should adopt. As General
                                MacArthur has pointed out, economic stabilization has now formally
                                become a basic and primary “Allied objective” in the occupation of
                                Japan. As far as United States policy toward Japan is concerned,
                                economic recovery is second only to United States security
                                interests. I believe that we can make, and should make at the
                                earliest practical moment through the diplomatic channel, a strong
                                case for our position. We can defend it not only on the grounds of
                                practicality and political realities, but also on the grounds of the
                                moral and political commitments we have assumed. Without in the
                                least detracting from our commitment that there shall be reparations
                                from Japan, we can in good conscience point out that there have been
                                reparations. Claimant countries have already appropriated, on
                                reparations account, from the Japanese economy large amounts of
                                overseas assets.</p>
                            <p>I believe, as is pointed out in the underlying memorandum, that we
                                could emphasize with great effect that, in considering the total
                                amount of reparations to be exacted from Japan, we have always
                                restricted that total to the amount which would allow a decent
                                livelihood for the Japanese; that the Japanese economy has been a
                                drain on the United States since the day of surrender; that the
                                United States must examine carefully present worldwide demands on
                                its resources and weigh each demand in the light of ability to meet
                                it; that to abandon Japan at this juncture would be to undo the
                                recent costly victory in the Pacific; and that we have no intention
                                of so abandoning Japan.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the bitter disappointment which claimant nations will
                                feel no matter what settlement we propose, I believe that we have a
                                stronger case, legally and morally, arid a more palatable
                                proposition, if we base our position on the fact that the
                                reparations which can be <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0023"
                                />taken from the Japanese without impairment of their ability to
                                make a decent livelihood have already been taken, than we do if we
                                attempt to agree that the Japanese can afford to give up only, say,
                                a hypothetical 100,000 machine tools whereas Australia or some other
                                country argues that the Japanese can give up 200,000 machine tools
                                plus 2 locomotives. The consequent debate upon details would deprive
                                us of a strong, unequivocal position and in the long run, because of
                                the necessity of compromise and the end result of almost nothing,
                                would bring more enduring bitterness than would a debate on the
                                defensible principle that no further reparations removals are
                                possible.</p>

                                reached another impasse in Washington largely due, this time, to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s unfavorable reaction to
                                the most recent State–Army proposals sent to him for his comment,
                                but also due to the following factors. There is serious question
                                whether a China, under or imminently under Communist domination,
                                should now be awarded the hitherto proposed 30–40% share of
                                reparations. There is a question whether the U.S. Congress and
                                public would, at this hour, let pass without sharp challenge the
                                award of any reparations whatever from Japan to the U.S.S.R. There
                                is the more fundamental question of whether a defensible case,
                                legally or politically, can be made for considering any reparations
                                program as a “final settlement” unless that program be erected upon
                                the basis of formal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> action.</p>
                            <p>2. I am conscious that a review of our “legal” obligations, under
                                Potsdam and previous U.S. commitments in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>, has been made in order to establish the framework
                                within which a satisfactory reparations program might be worked out.
                                I understand that there are a variety of possible programs under
                                study ranging from asserting the U.S. “first charge” claim against
                                all surplus capital in Japan, both fixed and liquid, and thereby
                                washing out reparations for other claimants to working out some
                                procedure for making available reparations <pb n="610"
                                    xml:id="pg_610" facs="0024"/>from current production along lines
                                developed in the Italian Peace Treaty. To my knowledge, all of the
                                proposals seem to suffer two weaknesses. They are intended to be but
                                cannot be “final.” Those that contemplate removals at all thus far
                                provide no method for preventing deliveries to Communist
                                recipients.</p>
                            <p>3. <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> has reached conclusions which it
                                wishes to embody in the form of a positive recommendation. Prior to
                                setting forth that recommendation I wish to make the following
                                general observations.</p>
                            <p>We do not attach great importance to the security objective of
                                industrial disarmament but we dislike having in Japan a large volume
                                of industrial facilities heretofore used exclusively for military
                                production, now idle, and unlikely to be put into economic
                                operation. The possibility cannot be ruled out that they could
                                become an embarrassment if not a security threat to U.S. interests
                                in Asia. Under present circumstances and partly by reason of this
                                “security” factor, reparations from Japan is primarily a political
                                rather than an economic problem. From the economic standpoint it is
                                obvious that paying any reparations imposes a greater economic
                                burden on Japan than paying no reparations. From a political
                                standpoint, it is clear that we could not now support any
                                reparations proposal which would fully satisfy the just and proper
                                claims of our Allies against Japan for the damage, destruction,
                                disruption and suffering brought about by Japan’s military
                                aggression. These axioms, simply understood, could be used to
                                support a U.S. case for no reparations at all. However, political
                                and economic considerations overlap if the position of the U.S. on
                                reparations should provoke international reactions so hostile as to
                                embarrass Japan’s trade prospects in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government should, I believe, be guided by the
                                following principles. It should support a reparations program: <list>

                                Government, is an interim program—a second stage in the Advance
                                Transfer Program—and that, although the U.S. will oppose any other
                                reparations in any form during the period of the occupation, the
                                final settlement of Japan’s obligations, including reparations, will
                                be worked out at the Japanese Peace Conference and not before. In
                                view of the present feeling of utter hopelessness prevailing in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> over prospects of securing
                                formal <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> action on any aspect of
                                the Japanese reparations problem, announcement of such a program, as
                                an interim measure, would be greeted with relief and gratitude. If
                                presented with pretensions <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0025"
                                />of finality, such an announcement would invite the severest

                                        influence of U.S. arguments against any restriction on
                                        Japanese peace industry might now be, more or less, willing

                                discussion, for the drastic changes which have been made in some of
                                the percentage awards in paragraph 4(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)
                                above. There follows an explanation of the changes made.</p>
                            <p>Because the U.K., Australia, Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, and
                                India have indicated approval of the U.S. percentage share proposal,
                                their percentages are adjusted upward <hi rend="italic">as though
                                    they had participated</hi> on a pro rata basis in the previously
                                proposed plan for re-allocation from the U.S.-Australian pool.</p>
                            <p>The French and Netherlands shares remain what they were in the
                                original U.S. proposal. Neither country accepted our offer. Both
                                present serious policy problems to the U.S. in the Far East.</p>
                            <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0027"/>
                            <p>The U.S.S.R. share has been reduced from 4% to 0% and the Chinese
                                from 30% to 15% on the grounds (1) that it would be politically
                                anomolous, at the present time, for the U.S. Government to take
                                unilateral action on the reparations question in order to set in
                                motion a program benefiting, in one case, a communist country, and
                                in the other, a country about to fall within the Communist sphere;
                                and, (2) that there is ample moral and practical justification for
                                this treatment, since both of these countries are in possession of
                                substantial amounts of Japanese external assets which were not taken
                                into account fully in our previous proposal.</p>
                            <p>In the case of the U.S.S.R. the value of the war booty which it
                                removed from Manchuria is clearly more than any conceivable Russian
                                claim for reparations would justify. In the case of China, it is
                                also in possession of large amounts of Japanese external assets but
                                we believe the U.S. could not reasonably reduce China’s share below
                                15% since world public opinion has come to believe that, on the
                                basis of their war devastation and suffering, the Chinese “people”
                                should properly be the principal recipient of reparations from
                                Japan. Thus, we believe that the U.S. should not reduce its own
                                previous 15% award to China under the U.S. advance transfer
                                directive. (It might be pointed out here that even if some machine
                                tools were to fall into Chinese Communist hands the security risk
                                would be negligible. Not more than 1% of the total pool of Japanese
                                machine tools available for reparations are of the sort which, in
                                Europe, are included in our 1A list under the R procedure for
                                East-West trade. Preclusive bidding by the U.S. or other friendly
                                nations, plus <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s discretion in
                                allocation could further reduce the number of such tools going to
                                China.)</p>
                            <p>Other countries have received as reparations in the form of Japanese
                                external assets nothing like the values already received by Russia
                                and China. These factors were not taken into full account in our
                                previous proposal on shares but now can be cited to justify the
                                modifications made in the U.S. percentage schedule.</p>
                            <p>8. The U.S. record in attempting to facilitate achievement of
                                international agreement on a final reparations settlement is good.
                                In 1946 for “broad political” reasons which seemed valid at the
                                time, the U.S. indicated willingness to spare Soviet feelings on the
                                war booty and external assets issues, if so doing would help to
                                achieve international agreement on reparations. However, the
                                U.S.S.R., and only slightly less clearly, the Chinese, and several
                                other countries, have obstructed attainment of the final and
                                comprehensive international agreements which were hoped for.</p>
                            <p>Thus due to <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> failure a U.S.
                                program will be put into effect unilaterally. It cannot have other
                                than an interim character. The final settlement of Japan’s
                                obligations to the Allies must await the Peace Conference and at
                                that time the extent to which Japan’s external assets <pb n="614"
                                    xml:id="pg_614" facs="0028"/>in possession of the Allies
                                contribute towards satisfying such obligations will necessarily be
                                reviewed.</p>
                            <p>All primary war facilities received in the meantime, whether under
                                individual country shares or out of the U.S. share, would be duly
                                recorded by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> and would be
                                credited to Japan as contributing towards the final settlement of
                                all claims against Japan.</p>
                            <p>9. The reduction in the Chinese share increases the proportionate
                                share which the U.S. will award itself. The undesirable implications
                                of greed or self-interest which could and doubtless would be drawn
                                from this fact, both domestically and abroad, can be mitigated if
                                not entirely eliminated if it be announced clearly that none of the
                                U.S. share will be delivered to continental U.S. That principle has
                                been incorporated in the directive itself. The U.S. Government
                                should, however, state, further, to <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> countries, in diplomatic talks, that its share is
                                not being held for the Japanese economy but will be re-allocated, on
                                instruction of the State Department to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>, to claimant countries which cannot satisfy their
                                needs within their own authorized shares and can provide evidence
                                that delivery of additional amounts would contribute to economic
                                development of their countries and economic relief and
                                rehabilitation throughout the Far East as a whole.</p>

                            <p>The Soviet Member opened discussion by reading a prepared statement,
                                the main points of which were that Japanese police forces now exceed
                                the authorized limit of 125,000 men, that these police forces are
                                being organized into military units with a central headquarters, and
                                that secret police are now being extensively used in Japan.</p>
                            <p>Statistics, mostly based on press reports, were adduced to show that
                                there are now a total of 141,206 police in Japan. Reference was also

                                attributed in the press to Lieutenant General Eichelberger
                                recommending an increase in the size of Japan’s police forces up to
                                275,000 men.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Member then cited further press reports to show that the
                                Japanese police were being formed into armed units by the director
                                of the national police and that a centralized police administration
                                had been established to control all Japan’s police.</p>
                            <p>Finally, he quoted labor union petitions and press reports to show
                                the prevalence of “secret police” used to break strikes and
                                interfere with civil rights.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Member concluded by recommending to the Supreme Commander
                                that Japanese police forces be limited to 125,000 men, that no
                                revision of existing legislation be permitted which would increase
                                the size or strengthen the armament of the police, and that secret
                                police organizations be dissolved.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I described the actual size and organization of Japan’s
                                police forces, noting their complete conformity with Allied policy
                                requirements, and then took issue with several of the more egregious
                                allegations of the Soviet statement.</p>
                            <p>I noted that the criteria for police reorganization as defined by the
                                Supreme Commander were decentralization and establishment of the
                                principle of local autonomy, adding that Japanese legislation
                                embodied these standards and, as directed by the Supreme Commander,
                                provided for a total police force of 125,000 men.</p>
                            <p>Proceeding to the body of the Soviet statement, I stressed that it
                                was part of a coordinated Soviet campaign to undermine the policies
                                of the Occupation, the Far Eastern Commission, and the United States
                                Government, and I expressed concern that the Allied Council was
                                again being used as a sounding board for Soviet propaganda. In order
                                to refute specific charges, I pointed out that Japanese police
                                carried only small arms or sticks, that the Maritime Safety Board
                                had only 1,979 men with police authority rather than 10,000, that
                                General Eichelberger is no longer a member of the Occupation, and
                                that I had no knowledge of secret police in Japan.</p>
                            <p>I stated that I had no comment on the Soviet Member’s recommendations
                                for the reason that they were too self-evident to require
                                comment.</p>
                            <p>The British Commonwealth Member referred to the Basic Post-Surrender
                                Policy for Japan approved by the Far Eastern Commission and stated
                                that no contravention of this policy had been shown. He stressed
                                that it was important that General Eichelberger did not speak as a
                                member of the Occupation and added that it was necessary to remain
                                vigilant lest the police become a breeding ground for principles
                                that should be eradicated.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese Member commented on Chinese concern over the progress <pb
                                    n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0030"/>of the new Japanese police
                                system and emphasized that General Headquarters must maintain close
                                supervision.</p>
                            <p>As rebuttal, the Soviet Member alleged, with no amplification, that
                                the facts which he had submitted had not been disproved and that he
                                confirmed his recommendations.</p>
                            <p>In order that the true facts might be made clear, I invited the
                                Members of the Council to make an inspection of police
                                establishments, and I asked the Soviet Member if he would accept the
                                invitation. No action was taken on this invitation, the Soviet
                                Member stating that he would decide later.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                    >FEC</gloss>–329/2, an interim directive sent by the US Govt to
                                        <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> on 10 Dec 1948, and
                                    the level of industry problem now being considered by the
                                    Commission. Other members of the Comm have associated themselves
                                    with this question. Para ‘h’ directs <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                        >SCAP</gloss> to ‘increase production of all essential
                                    indigenous raw material and manufactured products.’ The level of
                                    industry discussions which have taken place in this Commission
                                    have been concerned with determination of that industrial
                                    capacity in Japan which should be considered available for
                                    removal as reparations, it having already been agreed by this
                                    Comm that industrial facilities (except those which have been
                                    destroyed by virtue of being specialized war-making facilities)
                                    required for the needs of a Japanese peace economy should not be
                                    removed as reparations. In <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>’s reports on Japan’s econ development we see that
                                    the overall index of Japan’s manufacturing activity, with no
                                    adjustments made for population growth, etc., is no more than
                                    65% of 1930–1934 levels. Needless to say, none of this
                                    manufacturing activity is of a military character. Raw material
                                    shortages and difficulties in finding markets for manufactured
                                    output will make it most difficult for Japan to exceed 1930–1934
                                    levels even with maximum effort on the part of the Japanese.
                                    Yet, unless those production levels are reached and, even, in
                                    some cases surpassed, due to population, technological and trade
                                    pattern changes, Japan will not be self-supporting and its
                                    deficits will fall upon the US taxpayer. My Govt feels,
                                    therefore, that there is no conflict and, in fact, no practical
                                    relation between the consideration being given to the level of
                                    industry problem by the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and

                            <p>Austral Member stated while his Govt has no real objection to
                                substance of interim directive it was of opinion that <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should not have been by-passed. He
                                noted need to stabilize Jap economy had been recognized by the
                                Commission and by the Allied Council early in 1947. He pointed that
                                issuance of an interim directive should imply no inference that
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and Allies generally had
                                been unaware their responsibilities this connection. He felt one
                                inference that might be drawn from issuance of an interim directive
                                might well be that US had little confidence in <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>’s willingness or ability cooperate
                                quickly an emergency situation. He added, however, US must bear
                                considerable aliare of blame in paralyzing Commission in not
                                submitting US positions on many important econ questions. That as
                                result of issuance of interim directive it had been popularly
                                assumed in Jap that objectives of this stabilization program are to
                                be achieved, if necessary, at sacrifice of certain processes of
                                democratization in Jap. He referred to relationship between wage
                                stabilization program and development of healthy trade union
                                movement and stated there was reason fear that possibly Jap Govt
                                itself, under guise this economic stabilization program, might
                                assume they have right go back to authoritarian and anti-labor
                                practices to the subordination of democratic rights. He inquired of
                                US member if it was intention of US Govt that this interim directive
                                supersedes or is to be carried out at expense of democratic policies
                                which have been passed by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. In
                                reply to Sov inquiries US member replied the directive is broad

                                to work out with Jap Govt under the Constitution and democratic

                                of peaceful needs of Japan. They will note that that policy deals

                                standard of living of Japanese people. That policy was explicit in
                                dissociating standard of living concept from any arbitrary
                                prescription for pattern of Japanese industry. In other words, paras
                                2 and 3 of that policy make clear that nature and size of a Japanese
                                industrial structure capable of satisfying Japan’s peaceful needs
                                will be affected by population growth and various other factors and

                            <p>The Department will observe that Mr. Vaughn quoted Premier Yoshida as
                                being enthusiastic about General MacArthur’s recommendations for
                                economic reconstruction. In that connection he is quoted as stating
                                that his Government is planning the formation of a committee to
                                review “the cases of a number of top-flight industrialists who were
                                purged, possibly unjustly”.</p>

                            <p>In subsequent public statements on the same subject Premier Yoshida
                                has emphasized the need to reconsider the purge of village and town
                                headmen and allowed the reconsideration of purged industrialists to
                                appear as incidental (this Mission’s despatch no. 22 of January 14,

                            <p>Apparently undeterred by the warning from Government Section, the
                                Japanese Government is reported proceeding with its plans for a
                                purge review committee. <hi rend="italic">Mainichi</hi> on January
                                17 reported that Justice Minister Ueda has finished drafting a plan
                                for the establishment of such a committee. It states also that the
                                projected system “will liberate purgees only in those cases where
                                the purge is recognized to be clearly unjustifiable”, and that
                                “nobody who should be purged on formal as <pb n="623"
                                    xml:id="pg_623" facs="0037"/>well as substantial grounds will be
                                cleared”. A translation in full of this <hi rend="italic"

                            <p>In an editorial on January 12, 1949, <hi rend="italic">Mainichi</hi>
                                (in the only editorial on the subject which has recently come to the
                                attention of the Mission) adopts in effect the position taken by
                                General Headquarters, i.e., that abandoning the categories of
                                purgees for substantive charges opens the way to clearance of many
                                persons who ought not to be cleared. <hi rend="italic">Mainichi</hi>
                                considered that, should the ban be lifted, “it would be difficult to
                                find a yardstick by which to determine the men of high character and
                                those who are not”. It found that “the public’s estimation of a
                                man’s ability has changed during the past few years” but it believed
                                that “men who can work should be permitted to do so”. This newspaper
                                continued: “In political circles there is a big vacuum. In other
                                fields, new men have filled the vacancies created by the purge. The
                                only difference is that the new men lack experience and are less
                                known. But in the political field, it is disheartening to find
                                fledglings who, because they have been returned to the Diet once or
                                twice, are being considered as competent candidates for cabinet
                                posts. Should the purged politicians return, much activity can be
                                expected, but we would rather see new men come up in the coming
                                general election.” A full translation of this editorial is

                                important Recommendations (pages 14 and 15). The DRB’s “Basic

                                <p>I appreciate most sincerely your thoughtful courtesy in referring
                                    for my comment the review of the Japanese Constitution. With
                                    you, I have long realized that the emergence of a constitution
                                    which not only satisfied the requirements of the Potsdam terms
                                    but the well-being of a peaceful Japanese society as well, was
                                    the keystone to the arch of Japan’s successful reorientation in
                                    accordance with Allied policy objectives. Upon receipt of <gloss
                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> 031/41, I formally communicated
                                    the same to the Japanese Government and since then numerous
                                    conferences have been held between this Headquarters and
                                    Japanese Executive and Legislative officials on the procedure to
                                    be followed in such a review. We urged that a joint committee of
                                    the Diet be appointed to <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0041"
                                    />study the matter. Despite this, however, the Japanese have
                                    shown a strong disinclination seriously to consider
                                    modifications at this time, holding firmly to the view that a
                                    much longer period should elapse before subjecting the document
                                    to the test of mandatory Japanese review.</p>
                                <p>In general, the provisions of the constitution have worked well.
                                    Copies have been distributed in every Japanese home and much has
                                    been done by the Japanese themselves to educate the people as to
                                    its content and meaning and the document is increasingly
                                    becoming a source, of native pride. Japanese officials of all
                                    three branches of government are more and more turning to the
                                    constitution for guidance. Many healthy debates have been held
                                    both in the legislative chambers and in the public press over
                                    the proper interpretation of various of its provisions and
                                    recognition of the Supreme Court as the final judge of such
                                    interpretation is becoming firmly established, as the
                                    constitutionality of laws is challenged before that tribunal. It
                                    is now universally accepted as an indigenous product with little
                                    or no thought or expression given to Allied assistance in its
                                    composition. There is, indeed no slightest question but that the
                                    Japanese people with practical unanimity would vote to preserve
                                    the document unaltered were the matter referred for popular
                                    action. Nor is there, in my opinion, any question but that the
                                    constitution conforms meticulously with the spirit and intent of
                                    the Potsdam Declaration and other policy considerations
                                    controlling upon the occupation.</p>
                                <p>While there is no doubt but that improvement toward a greater
                                    degree of perfection is possible in various of its provisions,
                                    it is my belief that any Allied intervention to such end would
                                    only result in altering the accepted character of the
                                    instrument, now off to such a favorable start, to a
                                    disadvantageous degree. This conforms to the view which has
                                    informally been given me by the heads of every Allied Mission in
                                    Tokyo who have discussed the matter with me at all.</p>
                                <p>If my recommendation were desired, it would be that no action
                                    should be taken by the Allied Powers at this time to force upon
                                    the Japanese people a review of their constitution with the view
                                    to its modification. Nothing could be lost thereby as under its
                                    provisions the document is subject to revision by the Japanese
                                    at any time. They have fully accepted it, appear devoted to its
                                    high principles, and are working well within its framework.</p>
                                <p>With renewed thanks to the members of the Commission for their
                                    thoughtful reference and cordial expressions of my high
                                    regard.</p>

                            <p>Analysis of election: The election was a smashing conservative
                                victory. It gave practical assurance that the government would
                                remain unchanged for the next four years, with a decisive mandate to
                                one political party controlling a safe majority of the Diet seats.
                                The most impressive result of the election was the gain of 112 seats
                                by the Democratic-Liberal Party—to a lesser degree the sharp
                                reduction in the Socialist strength from 143 seats in the 1947
                                election to 49 seats resulting from the present election, and the
                                Communist gain of 31 seats. Although even with such gain the
                                Communist Party, in a strong one-party government, has not even a
                                legislative bargaining position.</p>
                            <p>The Democratic-Liberals drew their increased strength from the
                                Democrats, the Peoples Cooperatives and probably to some extent from
                                other smaller groups with conservative leanings, while the
                                Communists drew theirs almost entirely from the left-wing
                                Socialists, a development long anticipated. The extent of Communist
                                gains from this source is largely reflected in the reduction of 28
                                in the Socialist left-wing representation from its pre-election
                                strength. Both the Democratic-Liberal and Communist parties garnered
                                strength from the disrepute into which the center parties had fallen
                                as a result of the scandal investigations, which each vigorously
                                exploited.</p>
                            <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0044"/>
                            <p>The Democratic-Liberal Party campaigned effectively, urging voters to
                                support a strong single party qualified to lead the nation during
                                the period of economic rehabilitation ahead, stressing the
                                weaknesses resulting from past ineffectual coalitions. The Party
                                pledged itself to eliminate unnecessary economic controls, to reduce
                                government personnel, to eliminate the sales tax, and to adopt
                                measures which would stimulate the introduction of foreign
                                capital.</p>
                            <p>The Communist Party was benefited by external circumstances
                                peculiarly advantageous to the party. Developments in China, for
                                example, were exploited by the party, which insisted that only a
                                Communist Japan could live profitably in harmony with a Communist
                                China. Chiang Kai-Shek’s sudden retirement on the eve of the
                                election gave dramatic support to the Communist campaign propaganda.
                                Communists also won support by their promises to ease food
                                collection requirements and eliminate taxes of lower income groups
                                as well as their attacks upon the economic stabilization program of
                                the government. The Radical elements in the ranks of labor gave
                                strong support to Communist candidates not because of ideological
                                preference but by way of protest against the ineffectual labor
                                support of the Socialist Party and fear of suppressive measures
                                affected by the influence of the hundreds of thousands of Japanese
                                servicemen intensively trained in Soviet indoctrination centers
                                prior to their repatriation.</p>
                            <p>In assessing the extent of the Conservative victory, it is necessary
                                to take account of the support accorded the slightly more moderate
                                but essentially conservative Democratic Party and the smaller
                                conservative groups and individuals with conservative tendencies,
                                all of which add up to over 75 percent of the total number of seats
                                in the House of Representatives. Four successful independents have
                                already formally announced their intention to join the Democratic
                                Liberal Party.</p>
                            <p>The Communist gain, under existing extraordinarily favorable
                                conditions, should reflect the high water mark of its political
                                support, unless conditions alter even more in its favor. The danger
                                should not be discounted, however, from the unrealistic and undue
                                over-emphasis which will undoubtedly be given the Communist
                                political strength through ill-conceived propaganda efforts to be
                                expected from Moscow and elements of American journalism or
                                individuals either irresponsibly inclined or directly within the
                                orbit of Communist sympathy. Such propaganda, especially any from
                                seemingly reliable and responsible quarters, may be expected to be
                                fully exploited by the local Communist Party in the uncensored
                                Japanese press.</p>

                                        States agreed with the executive heads of China and Great
                                        Britain (with subsequent adherence of the Union of Soviet
                                        Socialist Republics) that Japan should not be permitted to

                                    <item>From the point of view of the Legal Adviser’s Office it is
                                        unthinkable that the United States Government, in view of
                                        the commitments entered into as above stated, should now
                                        propose a program to leave primary war facilities in Japan.
                                        It seems to the Legal Adviser to be peculiarly unfortunate
                                        that this proposed breach of our international commitment to
                                        destroy the Japanese war potential should be based solely on
                                        the pecuniary interests of the United States. In spite of
                                        this demeaning defense of our action, we shall, of course,
                                        be accused of an intent to thwart a basic tenet of the
                                        Potsdam Agreement, and of a purpose to enable Japan to rearm
                                        for war.</item>

                                    <item>The United States Government also stands committed, by
                                        other provisions of the same documents, to distribution as
                                        reparations of such industrial facilities in other
                                        industries, denominated “war-supporting industries”, as may
                                        be in excess of the peaceful needs of the Japanese economy.”
                                        These “peaceful needs” have been defined in a series of
                                        policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission known as the
                                        program for “Interim Reparations Removals”. In view of the
                                        fact, however, that the program is based on an estimate of
                                        the “peaceful needs of the Japanese economy” which passage
                                        of time has shown to be faulty, no stigma should be attached
                                        to a statement by the United States at the present time that
                                        it has changed its mind about the further distribution as
                                        reparations of “War-supporting industries”. No such defense
                                        is available, however, for a breach of the United States
                                        commitment to a 100 percent destruction or removal of
                                        primary war facilities.</item>

                            <p>It is, of course, appreciated that the whole reparations program has
                                been held up, through no fault of the United States, by the failure
                                of the Far Eastern Commission to agree on the division of the
                                reparations into shares. While the Legal Adviser’s Office would
                                favor a resolution of the impasse, by means of a U.S. interim
                                directive, for the purpose of distributing the primary war
                                facilities among the claimants, provided that military
                                considerations do not negative the advisability of such action, this
                                is by no means the only way out. If the United States does nothing
                                more than withdraw certain offers which she has made with respect to
                                her own shares, in an effort to end the impasse, the <pb n="633"
                                    xml:id="pg_633" facs="0047"/>stalemate will undoubtedly continue
                                until the peace-settlement; when the whole reparations problem will
                                have to be settled any way. No base motives could be imputed to the
                                United States if it takes no further steps to resolve the
                                dispute.</p>

                                MacArthur preferred the Army proposal. The State Department

                                General MacArthur in November 1948, for comment. General MacArthur’s
                                reply, received in mid-December, was that his recently received

                                        making up the heavy deficits in the Japanese economy, and is
                                        continuing to do so. Any reparations program, even one
                                        limited to primary war facilities, would necessitate
                                        diversion of Japanese lumber and transportation from
                                        productive purposes to the unproductive and inflationary
                                        tasks of packing and moving the reparations facilities, and

                                        taken by the United States on Japanese reparations have been
                                        based on the general assumptions that reparations would be
                                        taken only from facilities in excess of Japan’s own peaceful
                                        needs, and that there would be an agreed schedule of shares

                                        impossible to implement, and that with the failure of the

                                        schedule after two years’ negotiations, the United States
                                        and other <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries need
                                        no longer consider themselves bound by these decisions. Any

                                        Although the commitment to remove primary war facilities for
                                        reparations is unqualified by reference to Japanese peaceful

                                the inability of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> to agree on

                                occupation necessitated by the prolongation of the occupation

                                <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> recognizes; of course, that removal
                                of further industrial reparations from Japan would impose a greater
                                burden upon Japan than the removal of no further industrial
                                reparations. It believes, however, that the magnitude of that burden
                                has been greatly exaggerated, particularly when converted into terms
                                of U.S. dollars. It considers it improbable that the direct cost to
                                the United States of its proposed program would in fact exceed 4 to
                                5 million dollars, or that the indirect costs due to the effects of
                                the program on the Japanese stabilization program would total more
                                than 30 million dollars. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> believes,
                                as mentioned before, that all resources within Japan are
                                demonstrably necessary for Japan’s peaceful economy and that any
                                action tending to delay the execution of, or otherwise interfere
                                with, the Japanese stabilization and recovery programs would be
                                directly in conflict with United States policy and interests.</p>
                            <p>The question of which of the two proposals should be preferred is
                                essentially a question of political judgment, in which numerous

                                instituted Japanese stabilization program, the reactions of other

                                        are needed for the Japanese peacetime economy. All previous

                                        produce as bad a political reaction as the denial of the

                            </p>
                            <p>I have studied the papers forwarded to me with the memorandum by Mr.
                                Nitze and Mr. Butterworth dated January 27, 1949, including the
                                memorandum of Mr. Saltzman of the same date. Although I have not
                                examined the primary papers on which these documents are founded, as
                                I understand it, the situation briefly is as follows:</p>
                            <p>The legal obligations of the United States flow first from an
                                agreement in the Potsdam Conference that Japan should not be
                                permitted to maintain industries “which would enable her to rearm
                                for war.” The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> agreement of June
                                19, 1945 [<hi rend="italic">1947</hi>] provides that reparations
                                should be exacted from Japan through the transfer of Japanese
                                capital equipment and facilities “in the interest of destruction of
                                the Japanese war potential in those industries which could lead to
                                Japanese rearmament for waging war.” In the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> document of August 18, 1947 it was required that
                                all special purpose industrial machinery and equipment functionally
                                limited to use in connection with combat equipment end-products
                                should be destroyed. This, I understand, has been done. The same
                                document provides “that all other industrial machinery and equipment
                                in primary war industries” should be made available for claim as
                                reparations. Primary war facilities are those which were “primarily
                                engaged in the development, <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0055"

                                determined by the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.” Apparently
                                in other decisions of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                additional industrial equipment was to be made available for
                                reparations, although I do not have citations to the language or the
                                documents.</p>
                            <p>The machine tools which fall under the description of primary war
                                facilities are general purpose tools. They constitute 225,000 out of
                                a total of 700,000 machine tools in Japan. They are said to be the
                                newest and best in Japan. Already some 14,000 of these tools have
                                been delivered as reparations.</p>
                            <p>I also understand, and this is important, that there is an overriding
                                provision that such equipment as <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> determines is necessary for the purposes of the
                                occupation shall be withheld from delivery. I am told that <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> is presently using 22 percent of
                                the machine tools classified as primary war facilities in the
                                Japanese economy and believes that it could use 44 percent in the
                                near future.</p>
                            <p>While agreement has been reached in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> as indicated above, it has been impossible to reach
                                agreement on the shares which could go to the various claimants.
                                Therefore the United States has put deliveries into effect by itself
                                determining certain shares through an interim directive and in order
                                to facilitate agreement, has offered to waive a large portion of its
                                share in favor of other claimants.</p>
                            <p>Since the above interim directives were given, the Japanese economic
                                situation has become increasingly serious and the United States has
                                issued a new interim directive directing certain actions looking
                                toward stabilization of the currency, increased production, and
                                other steps to hasten Japanese recovery and self-support. In the
                                meantime, the deficit in the Japanese economy is being borne by the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>I understand also that in a telegram of January 22 <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> believes that he cannot carry out
                                the interim directive on reparations and at the same time
                                successfully achieve the purposes covered by the interim directive
                                on recovery. He, therefore, wishes to cease deliveries. <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s view of the matter seems to be
                                strengthened by the Johnston-Hoffman report which, as I understand
                                it, indicates a belief that more of these tools can and should be
                                used than had been previously estimated and that in many cases these
                                newer tools should be substituted for older ones in other
                                plants.</p>
                            <p>Under these circumstances, and if I am right in the analysis above,
                                it would seem to me in accordance with obligations undertaken and
                                wise and proper for the United States to withdraw the interim
                                directive on reparations and its offer of shares. The United States
                                should <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0056"/>not repudiate the
                                agreements previously made in <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.
                                It can properly insist that both <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>’s duty and the interests of the United States as
                                the nation which makes up the deficit, as well as of all the nations
                                parties to <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, call for the speedy
                                recovery of Japan and the placing of that country on a
                                self-supporting basis. If <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> and
                                others who have investigated the situation believe that the
                                continued delivery of these tools as reparations interferes with the
                                purposes of the occupation, and in particular the purpose stated in
                                the recovery directive, then I believe that we are warranted in
                                ceasing deliveries and initiating a proposal that the reparations
                                problem be considered at a later date when the full needs arising
                                from the purposes of the occupation can be stated more
                                accurately.</p>
                            <p>You will see that this memorandum does not fully accord with any of
                                the suggestions made to me. It may be that I have overlooked some
                                factor or that there is some error in the statement. I shall be glad
                                to have the views of the gentlemen who participated in the
                                preparation and also the views of those who are now concerned with
                                the negotiations attempting to settle a similar question in Germany.
                                Does what I have suggested fit in with those talks?<note n="2"

                                            <p>“At the January 27th meeting of the Far Eastern
                                                Commission the Soviet Member made a statement on the
                                                interim directive issued by the United States
                                                Government on December 10, 1948 regarding the
                                                economic stabilization of Japan.</p>
                                            <p>“On behalf of my Government, I wish to comment on
                                                several points which the Soviet Ambassador made. It
                                                was suggested that by issuing the 10 December
                                                directive the U.S. Government modified unilaterally
                                                the regime of control in Japan. In our view the
                                                directive in no way affects the regime of control
                                                for Japan which consists of the authority in Japan
                                                of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, the chain
                                                of command to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>,
                                                and the policymaking authority in Washington, Far
                                                Eastern Commission and the United States Government
                                                operating within the terms of reference in the Far
                                                Eastern Commission. Far from violating in any way
                                                the regime of control, the United States Government
                                                exercised its authority, clearly recognized by the
                                                terms of reference of the Far Eastern Commission, to
                                                take unilateral action on matters of urgency.</p>
                                            <p>“It was suggested further that because the 10
                                                December directive did not mention specifically the
                                                democratization program for Japan, the United States
                                                Government had ceased to be concerned in that
                                                objective. My Government was fully aware that policy
                                                decisions previously adopted by the Far Eastern
                                                Commission on the democratization of Japan were in
                                                existence. Since they are controlling, it was
                                                considered that there was no need to refer to them
                                                in this directive. In this connection, it seemed to
                                                go without saying that the major objective of an
                                                economic stabilization program for Japan is to
                                                create an economic environment in which genuine
                                                democratization can take place.</p>
                                            <p>“My Government regrets that the Soviet Ambassador
                                                failed to understand the purposes of the recent
                                                directive to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                                on economic stabilization for Japan and regrets
                                                particularly that the Soviet Ambassador’s mistaken
                                                understanding of the directive was made public
                                                before it could be corrected.”<note n="2"

                            <p>A–35. It has come to my attention that Secretary of the Army Kenneth
                                C. Royall held an off-the-record press conference at the American
                                Embassy on February 6, 1949. In response to questions by American
                                news correspondents, Mr. Royall advanced and developed the thesis
                                that in case of war with the Soviet Union, or even during the period
                                of the so-called cold war, Japan is, in fact, a liability, and that
                                it might be more profitable from the viewpoint of United States
                                policy to pull out all troops from Japan. He is further said to have
                                discussed the greater strategic advantages of Europe in comparison
                                with that of the Pacific in so far as a possible Soviet-United
                                States war is concerned.</p>
                            <p>One statement attributed to Mr. Royall in this conference reads to
                                the effect that the United States has no moral obligation towards
                                Japan, that we are not in Japan at our request, and that even though
                                it was our duty to disarm Japan it is not our responsibility if
                                someone else cuts Japan’s throat as a result.</p>
                            <p>Surprisingly, at a press conference on February 7, the morning
                                following the previous press conference, Mr. Royall was quoted as
                                having said that there is no difference of opinion between his views
                                and Washington on the one hand, and General MacArthur on the
                                other.</p>
                            <p>From personal knowledge, I know that General MacArthur does not share
                                the views voiced by Mr. Royall at his off-the-record conference. His
                                statement of agreement of views between himself and General
                                MacArthur would therefore appear to be a deliberate attempt to
                                mollify rumors of disagreement, or an effort to align General
                                MacArthur with his own views. General MacArthur, upon several
                                occasions, has told me of his concern over certain views apparently
                                held by responsible officers of the three Services in Washington. He
                                has repeatedly stated that the concept of concentrating American
                                military power in the Mediterranean area is strategically unsound
                                and that its implementation might well lead to disaster for the
                                United States. Conversely, he feels strongly that the Pacific island
                                chain from Kamchatka southward, to and including the Philippines,
                                must by all means be held as the westernmost line of defense of the
                                United States. He feels that any breach of this island barrier by a
                                hostile power would result in the front line of United States
                                defense being swept back to our west coast.</p>
                            <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0063"/>
                            <p>The Royall statements at his off-the-record conference are all the
                                more remarkable in view of the conditional release, “not for
                                attribution” and “not to be released prior to February 12,
                                1949”.</p>
                            <p>It is my opinion that Mr. Royall’s off-the-record press conference
                                and the resultant plethora of speculative press articles based
                                thereon will strike a heavy blow to America’s prestige in Japan and
                                possibly in the Far East generally. It would appear that no remarks
                                could have been better designed to revive Japanese interest in the
                                possibility or desirability of an orientation towards the Soviets,
                                particularly in the light of recent events on the continent of
                                Asia.</p>

                                determination of levels econ life in Japan and settlement of
                                reparations claims were obviously linked. Neither questions had recd

                                Besides, it also seemed clear Jap industrialists and traders were
                                anxious learn how both questions were going to be solved and in

                                may retain equipment for needs of the occupation.</p>
                            <p>Since you last considered this matter, cables have been received from
                                Mr. Dodge, Financial Adviser to General MacArthur (Tab B), and from
                                Mr. Royall (Tab C), emphasizing the need for a speedy decision in
                                the interest of Japanese recovery.</p>
                            <p>In reply to your question, there is attached a memorandum (Tab D) on
                                the relation of the German and Japanese reparations policies. Both
                                policies have had the same basic approach—to remove capital
                                equipment constituting war potential in excess of peace-time
                                needs—and our evaluation of the peace-time needs of both countries
                                has undergone change. The German program was undertaken much earlier
                                in the occupation than the Japanese, and we have less freedom of
                                action in Germany because the occupation is shared with the United
                                Kingdom and France. These differences are such that the two policies
                                are believed to have little appreciable effect on one another,
                                although it should be noted that we propose to carry out the bulk of
                                the removals which had been agreed for Germany, that review of the
                                German program has been in the interest of European recovery, that
                                we have not suggested the retention of any primary war facilities in
                                Germany, and that we acknowledge that revision of the program
                                requires British and French agreement.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>’s comments on your suggested
                                course are as follows:</p>
                            <p>The advantage of your proposal over that previously advanced by
                                    <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> is that its legality cannot be
                                questioned. On the other hand it would have the disadvantage of
                                failing to afford Japanese businessmen as complete assurance as the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> proposal might do that no
                                further reparations removals will ever take place, and that
                                therefore they may safely proceed with the rehabilitation of their
                                plants. Such assurance, it is believed, is vitally necessary if the
                                Japanese are to get back into production on a scale sufficient to
                                bring about the desired ends of the recently inaugurated economic
                                stabilization program. This point is strongly emphasized by Mr.
                                Joseph Dodge in the second paragraph of his attached telegram
                                received on February 7 (Tab B). No proposal can fully meet all
                                desiderata, however, and it may be that the implications of our
                                actions under your proposal would be almost as effective <pb n="652"

                            <p>It should be pointed out that the only basis for not proceeding with
                                implementation of the previously adopted series of <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> reparations directives is that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> has not been able to agree
                                to a division of reparations shares. Once a shares directive has
                                been issued by this Government or by the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> applicable to any portion of previous reparations
                                directives, it would, in the opinion of <gloss target="#t_FE1"
                                    >FE</gloss>, be difficult logically to refuse to apply such
                                shares directive to all previous reparations directives. Because of
                                this <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> is opposed to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_E1">E</gloss> proposal outlined below advocating the
                                issuance of a shares directive applicable to primary war
                                facilities.</p>

                                    <item>It is suggested, secondly, that instead of proposing that
                                        the reparations problem be considered at a later date when
                                        the full needs of the occupation can be more accurately
                                        assessed, we simply state when we rescind the Advance
                                        Transfer directive that we do not propose to take any
                                        further unilateral action to solve the reparations problem.
                                        We would by this procedure, it is believed, stand a better
                                        chance of permanently laying the reparations issue to
                                        rest.</item>

                                <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> concurs with the above proposal that
                                before we rescind the Advance Transfer directive discussions take
                                place with representatives of the friendly <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> countries. We believe that, however, in such
                                discussions we should indicate that if, in the light of the serious
                                economic conditions with which Japan is now faced, they would be
                                willing to state in good faith that they regard the distribution of
                                primary war facilities as being a substantial fulfillment of Japan’s
                                obligations for reparations payments in the form of capital
                                equipment we would be prepared to break the shares stalemate by
                                issuing an Interim directives.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss> believes that this proposal
                                possesses the following advantages: If accepted, (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>) The Japanese community would be given greater security
                                as to the present and future status of their industrial plant; <pb

                                having received significant reparations on this basis, claimant
                                countries would have less grounds for asserting claims for
                                reparations in the future from Japanese plant and equipment; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>) substantial amounts of industrial
                                equipment in primary war facilities which <gloss target="#t_E1"
                                    >E</gloss> is certain will remain idle in Japan would be put to
                                productive use outside Japan; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) and,
                                finally, the removing of primary war facilities from Japan could be
                                made an effective argument to answer the contention of Far Eastern
                                peoples that the U.S. intends to create a military base in Japan. If
                                not accepted we would at least have avoided being put in the
                                position with friendly governments of having brushed off their
                                reparations claims without an indication of a willingness on our
                                part to consider some sort of constructive action.</p>
                            <p>This action would require a prior decision on the part of the U.S.
                                Government that if a majority of the friendly <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries do agree to the proposal
                                a U.S. Interim Directive would be issued to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>If a majority of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> Governments
                                do not give appropriate assurances the U.S. Government should
                                withdraw its outstanding shares proposal and rescind its Advance
                                Transfer Directive, but should not issue an Interim Directive. In
                                that event, however, there should be released to the press a
                                statement of our efforts to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
                                reparations program, and our view that with the failure of these
                                efforts no further industrial reparations should be required from
                                Japan. We would thus at least obtain the advantages (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) of giving practical assurances to the
                                Japanese people that the U.S. Government will, on its part, oppose
                                further industrial removals as reparations, and (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>) of demonstrating to Far Eastern peoples our desire to
                                remove from Japan its primary war facilities.</p>
                            <p>There is attached for your information a memorandum (Tab E)
                                containing data supporting E’s belief that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> has greatly exaggerated the impact of the removal
                                of primary war facilities upon Japa nese economic recovery. These
                                data indicate the very much lower level of retentions which we have
                                heretofore considered adequate for Japan’s peace-time needs.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_O1">O</gloss> concurs generally with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_E1">E</gloss> recommendation, but is of the opinion
                                that, while it would be desirable before issuing a unilateral
                                directive to seek assurances from friendly <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> countries that they will not insist on further
                                capital removals and that they will accept our decision on shares as
                                being in their interest, nevertheless we should issue the directive
                                even if the assurances on further claims fall short of those
                                desired, unless the objections to the proposed shares indicate a net
                                loss of good will through the plan.</p>
                            <p>This conclusion is based upon the following reasoning. The U.S. is
                                expressly committed by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> agreement
                                to the removal as reparations of all primary war facilities except
                                equipment destroyed or retained <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654"
                                    facs="0068"/>temporarily for the needs of the occupation. (See
                                memorandum of the Legal Adviser dated January 27, previously
                                submitted, and Tab A hereto.) If the U.S. is to abide by this
                                agreement, it must see that the equipment is either removed now, or
                                held available for later removal. The latter course appears to be
                                implied in your suggestion that we observe our commitments but
                                simply defer action. To hold the equipment available indefinitely
                                will not give the Japanese the assurances they require (Tab B) and
                                will impose an unnecessarily heavy burden on the Japanese economy
                                (Tab C). To make the full assurances we desire from <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries a condition of pur action
                                would be regarded by them as requiring them to buy the same horse
                                twice, namely, our agreement to remove this equipment. For these
                                reasons, as well as for the sake of the general recovery of the Far
                                Eastern countries and the good will of their peoples toward the
                                United States and Japan, it appears better to make immediate removal
                                possible by unilateral U.S. directive.</p>
                            <p>There is some logical—but not legal—difficulty in applying a shares
                                decision to any quantity less than that covered by the interim
                                decisions. It will be much easier, however, to persuade the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries of the logic of this
                                procedure, which makes available to them a substantial quantity of
                                reparations, than to persuade them of the logic of making no
                                equipment available because we cannot agree to make all
                                available.</p>
                            <p>It is also recommended, in view of our repeated promise in the <gloss

                            <p>Mr. Sebald, the Acting Political Adviser in Tokyo, arranged an
                                appointment for me to see General MacArthur at 12:30 P. M. on
                                Thursday, February 3, 1949. The General greeted me with warmest
                                cordiality as an old friend and after some reminiscing and
                                discussion of general world affairs turned to the situation in the
                                Far East and particularly Japan. He said that conditions in Japan
                                had developed in a completely satisfactory manner much as was to be
                                expected. He indicated that he was satisfied with present conditions
                                and accomplishments. He pointed out that the situation in the Far
                                East at present made it impossible to conclude a peace treaty much
                                as we would have wished to have had one by this time. I gathered
                                that General MacArthur felt that it is impossible or undesirable to
                                attempt to foresee a date when a peace treaty can be concluded.</p>
                            <p>At the first suitable opportunity I took occasion to point out to
                                General MacArthur that the Department of State had attached great
                                importance to the rapid development of Okinawa as a strong
                                base—Army, Navy and Air—envisaged by the appropriate paragraph of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2; that the Department of
                                State had been eager to work out any suitable wording of the
                                pertinent paragraph of that paper which would be realistic and at
                                the same time satisfy the requirements of the Army’s Comptroller;
                                and that the Department of State had shown its willingness to
                                support in every feasible way the military development of our
                                position in Okinawa. I said that I had wanted to make clear to him
                                the attitude which the Department of State had taken toward Okinawa
                                because there had been some indication in the reports of his talk
                                with Mr. Flexer<note n="1" xml:id="d28fn1">Fayette J. Flexer,
                                    Counselor of Embassy in the Philippines until February 10 when
                                    he was transferred to the Department.</note> that he (General
                                MacArthur) was under <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0070"/>the
                                misapprehension that the Department of State had not been in full
                                support of the military development of Okinawa. The General replied
                                immediately and emphatically that on the contrary he understood and
                                appreciated the support which the Department of State had given this
                                matter; that it was the Army and the other Departments of the
                                National Military Establishment which he felt were not sufficiently
                                impressed with the need for the development of Okinawa and were not
                                giving it adequate support. He went on at some length to describe
                                the transfer of naval forces from the Pacific to the Atlantic, the
                                reduction of air forces in his theater and in the general Pacific
                                area, and what he described as the policy of the military to
                                “scuttle the Pacific”. He pointed out that most of the military
                                leaders of the United States were confirmed in the belief that the
                                Pacific was only of extremely minor significance and importance to
                                the United States as compared with Europe and the Atlantic. As an
                                example he pointed out that General George Marshall, whom he had
                                known intimately for a great many years, had always held that the
                                Far East and Asia were vastly inferior to Europe in relative
                                importance to the United States. General MacArthur disagreed with
                                these military concepts and felt that Asia and the Pacific areas
                                were being given, as they had been in the past, far too little
                                consideration. I gathered that he has put forward these views and
                                his arguments in support of them to the National Military
                                Establishment. (I learned later that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                    >JCS</gloss> have under consideration a new policy for
                                disposition of forces in the Pacific and that decision in that
                                connection is to be expected not later than early this spring. A
                                military decision of this sort has far-reaching political
                                implications and I assume that the Department of State will, either
                                directly or through the National Security Council, participate in
                                the final decision.)</p>
                            <p>While discussing the military situation I asked General MacArthur
                                whether, in the light of the historic and deeply rooted xenophobia
                                of the Chinese, their reluctance to allow foreign interference in
                                their own affairs and the obvious possibility, if not actual
                                probability, that the Russians would not have a free hand in
                                operating within or from China, he would consider vital the loss of
                                Formosa to the Chinese Communists providing no separatist or
                                resistance movement developed and were successful in Formosa and
                                they caved in along with the rest of China. The General’s reaction
                                was immediate and vehement. He said that if Formosa went to the
                                Chinese Communists our whole defensive position in the Far East was
                                definitely lost; that it could only result eventually in putting our
                                defensive line back to the west coast of the continental United
                                States. He said that he felt there could be no question but that if
                                Formosa were in the hands of the Chinese Communists it would be
                                available to the USSR as a base at any time the latter desired. He
                                pointed out that Formosa was astride the line <pb n="657"
                                    xml:id="pg_657" facs="0071"/>of communications between Okinawa
                                and the Philippines, that it outflanked our position on Okinawa and,
                                in the hands of the Chinese Communists, broke through the island
                                wall which we must have along the Asiatic “littorals” in order to
                                maintain in a strategic sense a defense line in the western Pacific.
                                Speaking of the strategy in the western Pacific General MacArthur
                                emphasized that we could be secure easily with the maintenance of
                                superior naval and air forces based on the islands lying off Asia.
                                He said that it would be a great mistake if we were to consider the
                                re-arming of the Japanese as an ally; that undoubtedly the Japanese
                                could be of great assistance to us in any future war; that <hi
                                    rend="italic">after</hi> a war should break out we might even,
                                before the war were over, have Japanese fighting on our side; but it
                                would be a grave error as well as an injustice, prior to the
                                outbreak of hostilities to put Japan in any position except that of
                                a militarily neutralized area. Referring again to the vital
                                importance of Formosa and to the fatal consequences of its loss,
                                General MacArthur emphasized that as long as we had superior air and
                                naval forces in that part of the world we could prevent a launching
                                from Asia of an attack on the United States, but that without
                                holding solidly this Asiatic fringe of islands, with Japan as a
                                neutralized area, our defense position would be forced back to the
                                west coast of the continental United States.</p>
                            <p>The third question which I had in mind to ask General MacArthur was
                                where he felt it desirable for Admiral Badger<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d28fn2">Adm. Oscar C. Badger, Commander, U.S. Naval
                                    Forces, Western Pacific.</note> and his forces to go in the
                                event they were forced to leave the China coast. General MacArthur
                                said that the present directives for the Far East Command required
                                that Admiral Badger’s forces, in the event of an emergency, would
                                come under <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>’s (General
                                MacArthur’s) Command; that if Admiral Badger were forced to leave
                                the China coast it might be well to consider that there had been
                                created those emergency conditions and that Admiral Badger’s forces
                                should be assigned to General MacArthur. He indicated that he
                                believed that Admiral Badger would not be averse to such an
                                arrangement; that the ships under Admiral Badger’s Command could
                                operate in and out of Yokosuka naval base in Japan; that while
                                everyone should be aware of the political implications involved and
                                such action should not be taken without due consideration to those
                                political implications, Admiral Badger might send occasionally
                                forces to operate off the China coast. In conclusion General
                                MacArthur reiterated his belief that these naval forces if required
                                to withdraw from the coast of China should come under his Command
                                and be based in whole or in major part at Yokosuka.</p>
                            <p>Almost at the end of the conversation, which lasted nearly two hours,
                                General MacArthur remarked that he was glad that Mr. Acheson <pb
                                    n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0072"/>had taken over the
                                Department of State; that while he might not have always agreed
                                fully with some of the State Department policies in the past he had
                                felt that the Far East in general and Japan in particular had been
                                given a full hearing when Mr. Acheson was Under Secretary of State;
                                and that he welcomed Mr. Acheson’s appointment as Secretary because
                                he felt once again Japan would receive its full measure of
                                attention.</p>
                            <p>As we were leaving General MacArthur made a passing reference to the
                                question of reparations from Japan and said that in the light of the
                                great quantities of resources which had been taken away and were no
                                longer available to the Japanese future livelihood, resources which
                                he said were far in excess of anything that had been taken from any
                                nation in modern times, it was inequitable and contrary to our best
                                interests to attempt to remove further resources from Japan.</p>

                                at the meeting of Committee #5 on the same day, to the effect that

                                first half of the paper only be adopted as a policy decision, the
                                second half to be left on the agenda of Committee #5 for future
                                consideration at the request of any government.</p>

                                my Brief Visit to Japan.</p>
                            <p>It is my intention to prepare and to forward to you as rapidly as
                                possible more detailed reports and summaries of the conversations
                                which I had and the documents which I collected while in Japan.
                                Because of the importance of timeliness, however, I shall attempt to
                                set forth in this memorandum important impressions which I believe I
                                should present to you immediately. Elaboration of the details and
                                some of the documents supporting these impressions will follow in
                                subsequent memoranda now under preparation.</p>
                            <p>During my brief stay in Japan I visited only the Tokyo-Yokohama area.
                                I found many evidences of material improvement. There had sprung up
                                during the almost two-year lapse since I was last in Japan more
                                factories, more houses, and there were in evidence more busses,
                                trains and streetcars, and general activities on the part of the
                                people. However, it was still obvious that transportation is
                                woefully inadequate, that housing is a desperate need, and that
                                industrial activity remains a pygmy compared to pre-war days.
                                Although several Americans told me that the Japanese people were
                                happy, the impression I gained from seeing their faces on the street
                                was one of rather quiet seriousness, if not sadness. Perhaps because
                                of the contrast of coming from the United States the Japanese seemed
                                to be more shabby in dress than they were two years ago. I was
                                assured by some American observers <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660"
                                    facs="0074"/>that actually the Japanese were noticeably better
                                off than they had been.</p>
                            <p>I was gratified to find only a feeling, as best I can describe it, of
                                tiredness of the occupation, rather than of bitterness. Nevertheless
                                I could not avoid the impression that the Japanese psychologically
                                were like a steel spring being wound tighter and tighter to recoil
                                the more violently when released. Whereas at the beginning of the
                                occupation the Americans came in, not without welcome, as conquering
                                heroes, they now approach being regarded as perhaps benevolent
                                oppressors with the benevolence wearing rather thin.</p>
                            <p>It is necessary that I should emphasize, before proceeding further,
                                that while this memorandum will decidedly be critical of the
                                situation in Japan I would not want anyone to gam the impression
                                that I in any sense discount or minimize the astounding
                                accomplishments of the occupation and of the Japanese under the
                                occupation. Such criticism as I make, it is hoped, will be
                                constructive and designed to preserve and protect those
                                accomplishments and in no way to detract from them. Perhaps one of
                                the greatest benefits from the occupation has been the development
                                in the United States of large numbers of Americans who are familiar
                                with and sympathetic to the problems of Japan accompanied by the
                                development in Japan of large numbers of Japanese who have come to
                                know and favorably regard ordinary Americans.</p>
                            <p>Practically all important Japanese of broad educational background
                                with whom I talked voluntarily expressed what I considered to be
                                genuine gratefulness for the economic assistance which the United
                                States has given Japan and for the real attempt at benevolence on
                                the part of the occupation. Nevertheless there was a strong
                                undercurrent even among these thinking Japanese of irritation at
                                occupation interference in the minutiae of daily life. All Japanese
                                showed a great eagerness to shake loose the tentacles of both
                                American and Japanese bureaucracy and to “get things going
                                again”.</p>
                            <p>I gathered from both Japanese and Americans with whom I talked that
                                the recent election was a protest vote—protest against the
                                occupation. Mr. Yoshida has become a symbol of Japan’s ability to
                                stand up to the occupation. The Communists openly and violently
                                denounce “American imperialists” and the “imperialistic occupation”.
                                Almost everyone seemed to sense that the present moment is the
                                crisis. Except for <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> officials,
                                the Americans as well as the Japanese with whom I talked, all on
                                their own initiative, expressed the greatest apprehension over the
                                development of Communist power and influence in Japan. Japan will
                                now either develop a desire for revenge or a sense of independence
                                and willingness to cooperate with the United States. Its economy
                                will either become stabilized, more productive and finally
                                self-sufficient, or collapse into inflation, chaos and revolution.
                                There <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0075"/>was an unmistakable
                                feeling that the next few months will be of greatest importance in
                                developing and directing future trends.</p>
                            <p>In the light of these circumstances I came away with the distinct
                                impression that it is necessary, as you yourself have so aptly put
                                it, for us rapidly to change the character of the occupation in
                                order that we may be always at least one or two jumps ahead of
                                developing Japanese psychology. If we wait until changes in the
                                character of the occupation are forced upon us by world developments
                                or by the actions of the Japanese themselves we shall once again be
                                placed in that uncomfortable position of yielding from weakness and
                                not from strength. We shall become ineffective in defensive
                                maneuvers when we should be effective in leadership.</p>
                            <p>In the light of the foregoing impressions you will have no difficulty
                                in imagining my amazement when I discovered a deep-rooted sense of
                                complacency and of permanency on the part of American officials of
                                the occupation. As one American newspaper observer who has been in
                                Japan almost from the day of surrender said to me: “These occupation
                                people have got a Philippine complex. They expect to be here for 40
                                years.” Another American put it that, whereas everyone in the
                                occupation used to be filled with a sense of urgency and
                                impermanency in his position, “five-year plans” are now being
                                devised. I gathered that the lower echelons and working levels,
                                particularly, in the <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                organization felt almost a smug isolation from the troubled events
                                of the outside world. It became apparent to me that it will require
                                the strongest and most determined action possible on the part of
                                highest officials in Washington to break up the entrenched
                                bureaucracy both in Tokyo and in Washington which has a vested
                                interest in the continuation of the present activities of the
                                occupation. One of the Army members of our party, for example, told
                                me that there are over 70 officials in the Economic, and Scientific
                                Section of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> alone who are in
                                the $9,000–$10,000 Civil Service grade. Another American
                                representative of a large oil company in Japan told me that in the
                                last week or so he had over 20 applications from <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> officials to obtain permanent
                                positions in Japan. He said none of these officials want to leave
                                Japan and return to the United States. A clear indication of the
                                liaison between the entrenched bureaucracy in Washington and in
                                Tokyo was given me by General Marquat (Chief, Economic and
                                Scientific Section of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, and an
                                old friend of mine) in reply to my jocular suggestion at dinner that
                                he should “call off his dogs” and give the Japanese a chance to run
                                their own business under the new principles which he had laid down.
                                He replied that even the Department of State was as eager as ever
                                that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> retain close control over
                                all activities in Japan. He added the State Department is still 100
                                per cent behind <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–230. When I
                                expressed complete consternation and repeatedly pressed him for
                                evidence of State Department support of <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662"
                                    facs="0076"/>
                                <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–230 he finally said that he had
                                not seen it in any official dispatches but that he had read it in
                                letters from State Department officials to people on his own
                                staff.</p>
                            <p>I had only a few conversations with the “bums”, as they are called by
                                occupation personnel, or, as we know them, American businessmen, but
                                I believe it is important to record immediately a remark which Mr.
                                Dennis McEvoy, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in
                                Tokyo, made to me. In the course of a rather long conversation he
                                said: “Contrary to the British, Indians, French and other
                                businessmen here in Japan, we Americans have no Mission to which we
                                can appeal to have our cause placed before <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>.” He pointed out that there was no American
                                official organization there which could effectively present, from a
                                biased point of view if you will, American desiderata. On the other
                                hand the British case was being most effectively pleaded by the
                                British Ambassador and his staff.</p>
                            <p>I gathered from conversations with General MacArthur and with General
                                Whitehead (Commanding General of the Far Eastern Air Forces) that
                                the United States does not require military occupation of Japan for
                                its military security in the Far East, providing Japan is
                                neutralized by stationing sufficient air and naval forces,
                                particularly air, in adjacent areas.</p>
                            <p>In summary I believe that we are now definitely at a crossroads in
                                the occupation of Japan; that it will require immediate, determined
                                and forceful action by the highest authorities in Washington to
                                bring about a change in the character of the occupation; that we
                                must immediately realize the full implementation of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2; that we must regard <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2 solely as an interim policy to
                                enable us to push on to, and to accomplish within the next 12 to 18
                                months, the sort of relationship with Japan which will flow from a
                                peace treaty, bilateral or multilateral, preferably the latter; that
                                if we are unable to bring about immediate and obvious beginnings of
                                a change in the character of the occupation, the Department of State
                                would be well advised to bring this impasse to the attention of the
                                President.</p>

                                Secretary’s attention.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">
                                <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>Whereas several years ago the Japanese looked upon the occupation as
                                a unified, all-powerful force, centering around an infallible
                                leader, they have come to see it today as a conglomeration of
                                persons having conflicting views and widely varying abilities. In
                                fact, they have become overly cynical about intra-headquarters
                                differences and overly prone to attempt to pit one American official
                                against another. Even General MacArthur has lost his aura of
                                sanctity.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese have not forgotten who won the war and they continue to
                                be grateful for America’s generosity during the Occupation. This
                                reservoir of goodwill is, however, being increasingly undermined by
                                countless petty irritations inevitable in any occupation, notably,
                                the contrast between lush Occupation and poverty-stricken Japanese
                                living standards, as well as the usual number of atrocity stories
                                involving occupation troops, This irritation with the occupation was
                                significantly demonstrated by the returns of the recent election
                                which resulted in a resounding defeat of those parties which were
                                tainted with “collaboration” with General Headquarters.</p>
                            <p>The reasons for rapidly growing Communist sympathy in Japan are: (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) Communism’s clear-cut opposition to the
                                Occupation, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the fact that any simple
                                positive creed has special appeal for a people intellectually at
                                sea, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) our own mistaken information policy
                                which has managed to preserve the “forbidden fruits” charm of
                                Communism. These attitudes are warnings that we have failed to carry
                                out a program of positive education on the fundamentals of modern
                                democracy or to keep the Japanese in touch with intellectual and
                                political currents of the outside world. They have been given no
                                basic understanding of democratic philosophy, but merely a series of
                                half-understood techniques associated with the democratic system in
                                the U.S. The Japanese are “crying for information, but we have so
                                reduced the flow that they have been forced to drink from the stream
                                of Communist propaganda to attempt to quench their thirst”. Many
                                Japanese intellectuals have swung over to Communism in the last few
                                months.</p>
                            <p>To some extent the growing Japanese dissatisfaction with the
                                occupation is a sign of the success of our first lesson in
                                democracy, for an attitude of criticism is an inherent feature of
                                any democracy, but it is essential that this developing critical
                                attitude not be converted into outright hostility toward the
                                occupation and its objectives.</p>
                            <p>Taking all these various factors into consideration, there seems to
                                be indicated a cautious, gradual transformation of Japan to
                                independent statehood, with the U.S. retaining certain military
                                safeguards and perhaps advisory functions in the many fields where
                                reforms are incomplete and with some sort of international control
                                over Japan of a negative nature. The transition of Japan to an
                                independent, democratic state will probably be easier and safer to
                                make today than five or ten years later.</p>

                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The US on behalf of the Allies accepted immediately following
                                    Japan’s capitulation primary responsibility for the military
                                    occupation of Japan. The US continues to have important interest
                                    in a sound progressive transformation from conditions of war to
                                    conditions of peace and order in the Pacific. The US has no
                                    intention of relinquishing these military responsibilities or of
                                    shirking them in any degree. Neither has it any intention of
                                    abdicating the responsibility and leadership which it accepted
                                    from the outset for the relief and reform of Japan.</p>
                                <p>The inability of the Japanese economy to provide even a
                                    subsistence level of life for its people occasions yet another
                                    demand upon the resources of the US. It is of first importance
                                    in understanding US interest in Japanese recovery to bear in
                                    mind that unless the Japanese people are enabled to earn a
                                    decent livelihood, there can be no solid ground upon which a
                                    respectable and peace-loving Japanese society can develop and
                                    endure.</p>
                                <p>It must be remembered, however, that US resources are not
                                    unlimited and that in meeting the ever increasing demands on US
                                    resources from all over the world those demands must be
                                    evaluated in terms of their urgency and of their possible
                                    effective contribution to world stability and recovery. A basic
                                    factor in that evaluation is, of course, the degree to which the
                                    recipients, including the Japanese, exert every effort on their
                                    own behalf to regain a self-supporting status at the earliest
                                    possible moment and also to aid general world recovery and
                                    cooperation.</p>
                                <p>The US, expecting full measure of Jap self-reliance, has no
                                    intention while discharging its obligations under the occupation
                                    of allowing Japan to become victim to that type of insidious,
                                    concealed aggression and infiltration which thrives upon
                                    economic chaos. To abandon Japan in such a manner would be to
                                    undo our costly victory in the Pacific.</p>
                                <p>In the evolution of conditions from war to peace, it is to be
                                    expected that Japan will henceforth progress only if given every
                                    opportunity to obtain as many as possible of the attributes of a
                                    normal government and society with ever increasing
                                    responsibility for and initiative in the direct management of
                                    its own affairs, both domestic and foreign.</p>
                                <p>In brief, the US will maintain its leadership in the recovery and
                                    reform of Japan and in Japan’s development into a self-reliant,
                                    responsible and peace-loving state. At the same time, the US
                                    will stand firm in the discharge of its military
                                    responsibilities.”</p>

                            <p>For your confidential information, it is desirable to avoid any
                                discussion of the legal status of Eighth Army tribunals in Japan
                                since this question may be at issue in future appeals from such
                                courts to the Federal courts of this country and it is not wished to
                                take any position at present before the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> which will prejudice the position which the

                                of the Government in arguments before the courts. For the same
                                reason, it would be undesirable to have the other members of the

                                democratic rights of Jap working people. He added that Labor <gloss

                                and maximum wage level which would clearly lead to further

                                people. He also pointed out that it was reported in Jap press that
                                “rationalisation” Jap enterprises by US occupation authorities and
                                Jap Govt would be accompanied by mass discharges of workers and
                                would lead to great increase in unemployment. It was also his view
                                US is pursuing in Japan policy of its own, directed towards
                                preservation and strengthening large Jap concerns which played great
                                part in aggression carried out by Jap militarists, in support of
                                which he cited measures to revise anti-trust law and refusal US to
                                discuss <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–230.</p>
                            <p>He further noted that attempts Jap Govt stimulate development export

                                mission January 24, and indicated interest in reaching understanding

                                suggested that unless such understanding could be reached,
                                discrimination against Japnese textiles might become necessary, and
                                further, that without such understanding British industry hesitates
                                to go forward with their own rehabilitation plans.</p>
                            <p>In reply, it was stated that the request for a joint U.S.–U.K.
                                textile industry mission would be discussed with the Department of

                                an industry such as textiles would be restricted as to its role in

                                understanding.</p>
                            <p>(2) Dr. Claudius Murchison of the Cotton Textile Institute requested
                                a conference with government officials on behalf of five cotton
                                textile associations. A meeting was arranged for February 3 with
                                representatives of State, Commerce and Army. Representatives of the
                                textile associations expressed concern over the softening of the
                                export market in textiles and attributed price decline to the
                                selling and pricing policies followed in disposing of Japanese
                                textiles. They expressed sympathetic interest in the proposal of Sir
                                Raymond Streat for a U.S.–U.K. textile mission to Japan but
                                indicated that final decision of the industry’s views was being
                                withheld pending discussion of possible representation by the United
                                States Government concerning discrimination against American
                                textiles in the sterling area. However, the U.S. textile industry
                                representatives did not mention an agreement as to the future role
                                of Japanese textiles in world trade as an objective of the mission.
                                They stressed the importance of the general review with <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> and with Japanese textile
                                representatives of world textile trade prospects taking a long-run
                                view. Furthermore, they showed no interest in an early departure of
                                such a mission.</p>
                            <p>It was suggested to them that if the industry representatives decided
                                to join with the U.K. in requesting that a mission be sent, a letter
                                should be written to the Department setting forth the purposes of
                                the mission and the results which they contemplated. In answer to a
                                direct question from the industry group it was stated that the
                                cotton textile industry of Japan has never been regarded as subject
                                to control for security reasons and that no limitation to the
                                rehabilitation of the industry in a peace treaty or otherwise had
                                received consideration. The U.S. interest in encouraging the
                                development of a well rounded and self-supporting Japanese economy
                                in order to relieve the burden of American taxpayers was explained.
                                That the U.S. Government <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0083"
                                />would insist that Japan avoid resort to unfair trade practices
                                such as may have characterized some of its deals in the 1930s was
                                also emphasized. With respect to the question of lack of available
                                dollar exchange in the sterling area for the purchase of U.S.
                                textiles, it was suggested the Department be furnished with the
                                facts of the situation including specific instances of limitations
                                on U.S. textile exports whereupon the Department would consider
                                taking the matter up with the U.K. Government.</p>
                            <p>(3) On the afternoon of February 3, Sir Raymond Streat discussed the
                                question of a textile mission with Department representatives. Sir
                                Raymond followed the same approach as Dr. Murchison, stressing the
                                desirability of a thorough review with <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> and the Japanese textile industry representatives
                                of the world cotton situation including the prospects for Japanese
                                textiles in world trade. He made no mention of reaching an
                                understanding concerning Japan’s role in textile export trade. He
                                considered it most important from the point of view of avoiding a
                                further softening in the textile export trade and of giving
                                reasonable encouragement to the rehabilitation of the British
                                textile industry that the U.S. and the U.K. give the appearance of
                                having the situation under control by sending a joint mission to
                                Japan, Sir Raymond was anxious to have an early announcement made
                                that a mission had been approved but he thought that September of
                                this year would be an appropriate time for the mission’s
                                departure.</p>
                            <p>In reply, it was stated that U.S. textile industry representatives
                                had not yet requested approval of the proposed mission but as soon
                                as such a request was made the Department would consider the matter
                                in consultation with other departments of the Government and <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> and would inform the British
                                Embassy of this Government’s position.</p>
                            <p>(4) The Department recognizes that the U.K. will continue to relate
                                its interest in Japanese textile production to the question of
                                granting M–F–N treatment to Japan and that taking an hostile
                                attitude toward the proposed mission would militate against success
                                in this regard at the next <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>
                                conference. The Department is concerned however that before a
                                mission is undertaken its terms of reference be agreed to by both
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>In Department’s view, textile surplus alone cannot be made subject of
                                intergovenmental commodity control agreement under Chapter VI of
                                Charter. Inclusion of textiles in a commodity control agreement
                                would only be possible in an agreement directed to a burdensome
                                surplus in cotton, and then only in the contingency that inclusion
                                of textiles significantly helped to alleviate the cotton
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that such a mission should operate strictly within an
                                information giving, fact-finding framework. The mission should not
                                be given authority to attempt arrangements which would be
                                inconsistent <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0084"/>with, the
                                Charter, e.g. arrangements for the fixing of prices, allocation of
                                markets or limitation of production.</p>
                            <p>(5) It is suggested that the substance of the Department’s position
                                may appropriately be brought to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>’s attention. The airgram under reference was very
                                timely and helpful to the Department.</p>

                                    <item>Solely from the military viewpoint, the establishment of
                                        Japanese armed forces is desirable as such forces would
                                        share the burden of the defense of Japan and thus effect
                                        economies in utilization of our own limited manpower;</item>

                                        the creation of a coastal police, is not practicable and
                                        advisable at this time because such action would require
                                        amendment by the Japanese of their new constitution and our
                                        abrogation of the Potsdam Declaration. In addition, it would
                                        adversely affect Japanese economic recovery;</item>

                                <p>“While it appears desirable that the Japanese police
                                    establishment be strengthened now by re-enforcing and
                                    re-equipping the present National Rural Police and Maritime
                                    Safety Board (Coastal Patrol), it is doubtful that it will be
                                    advisable for a long time to come to permit the establishment of
                                    limited Japanese armed forces. However, there may be a present
                                    need for planning for utilization of Japanese manpower to assist

                                    Secretary, same subject, dated March 11, 1949. [Footnote in the

                                opinion that it would be both undesirable and premature to initiate
                                any measures which would be recognized as a step toward the creation
                                of Japanese military forces since such measures “would destroy the
                                character and purpose of the occupation.” However, General MacArthur
                                concurs in the above-quoted comments of the Secretary of the
                                Army.</p>
                            <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff appreciate General MacArthur’s position
                                with reference to even limited military armament for Japan since any
                                rearmament is inconsistent with both the Terms of Surrender and the
                                Potsdam Declaration which he, as Supreme Commander for the Allied
                                Powers, is required to enforce. However, in view of the
                                unsatisfactory world situation and the likelihood of its worsening,
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that anticipatory measures should be
                                undertaken at an early date in order that some of the military
                                potential of Japan may be used in the defense of that country should
                                the situation demand it. This view is in consonance with the comment
                                by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                13/1 “that it may well become extremely important to our national
                                security for Japan to be capable of providing some degree of
                                military assistance to the United States, at least to the extent of
                                Japan’s own self-defense.”</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2, which was approved by the
                                President as of 9 October 1948, accepts the principle of
                                strengthening and reequipping the Japanese police establishment,
                                including the Coastal Patrol. The report indicates, however, that
                                United States policy on post-treaty arrangements for Japanese
                                military security should not be formulated until peace treaty
                                negotiations are upon us and that it should be determined at that
                                time in the light of the prevailing international situation and the
                                degree of internal stability achieved in Japan.</p>
                            <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff feel that it would be unwise, in the light
                                of the evident trend toward world unrest, to postpone consideration
                                of the problem of Japanese military security until such time as
                                peace treaty negotiations may be undertaken, since serious emergency
                                conditions may well arise in the interim. They believe, therefore,
                                that the terms of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2 should
                                now be reviewed in order that provision may be made for Japanese
                                armed forces to be available to assist in home defense in an
                                emergency. If this is to be done, planning and preliminary steps
                                should be initiated at an early date. These steps should include the
                                strengthening and arming of the police and Coastal Patrol in the
                                manner indicated in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the study by the
                                Department of the Army with a view to the use of these forces as <pb

                                defensive Japanese units intended to maintain internal security and
                                to be employed for local defensive action against external attack.
                                Provision of weapons, equipment, and ammunition for this purpose
                                should be considered an M-Day requirement for logistic planning
                                purposes.</p>
                            <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that it would not be practical nor
                                desirable at this time to form a nucleus for an air arm. It might be
                                possible at a later date, however, to arrange for some air transport
                                facilities in order to improve the mobility of Japanese light
                                defensive forces.</p>
                            <p>All of these measures would have to be carried out with great caution
                                in the light of announced allied policies. The ultimate objective of
                                eventually creating limited Japanese armed forces should be held in
                                highest secrecy unless or until general implementation measures are
                                warranted by the international situation.</p>
                            <p>In the light of the above considerations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                are of the opinion that it would be in the interests of our national
                                security that: <list>

                            <p>Since hostilities with Germany and Japan ended, consideration has
                                been given from time to time to the State Department’s taking over
                                control of non-garrison aspects of military occupation. Such
                                consideration has usually revolved around Germany. Little attention
                                has been given to Japan. Now there is a fundamental difference
                                between the situations in Germany and in Japan. It is believed that
                                this distinction has not been sufficiently emphasized. The
                                distinction is that in Japan we have a constitutional government
                                established pursuant to the Potsdam decisions and the Terms of
                                Surrender and functioning effectively throughout the whole country.
                                That is an objective in government toward which we are working in
                                Germany. If we had it, the problem of control there and the
                                direction of that control by a suitable United States civilian
                                authority would be infinitely simpler.</p>
                            <p>The Japan problem should therefore be approached with this
                                consideration in mind: There is in Japan a government established
                                under policies and procedures laid down under the occupation. That
                                government has been functioning successfully throughout Japan. As to
                                its capability of exercising virtually complete administrative
                                responsibility in Japan, two years ago General MacArthur said that
                                the time was ripe for a peace treaty and a year and a half ago the
                                State Department proposed a conference to draw up a peace treaty.
                                International developments, principally Soviet Russia’s aggressive
                                policy of expansion, caused indefinite postponement of peace treaty
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0089"/>
                            <p>With an effective and fully responsible Japanese Government,
                                experienced in administration, there is no need in Japan for a large
                                civil affairs occupation staff. Only a skeleton staff, numbering
                                from 10 to 20 high grade experts, with subsidiary assistants
                                numbering not more than several scores, would be required.</p>
                            <p>What is envisaged is the kind of situation we would have if a peace
                                treaty had been concluded and put into effect, with an added
                                provision that United States forces remain in Japan. <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> would remain as the supreme
                                authority. He would, however, exercise his authority only through
                                supervisory control and through intervention, when necessary. Under
                                this general authority, the Japanese Government would assume and
                                exercise full responsibility for administering Japan.</p>
                            <p>Under this concept the transfer to the State Department of the
                                control of non-garrison aspects of military occupation of Japan
                                would entail little administrative or operational burdens.</p>
                            <p>The principal reform measures introduced into Japan under the
                                occupation have been largely completed. It is not expected that
                                there will be further reform measures. General supervisory
                                observation of Japan’s continuing to carry out the reform measures
                                is all that is needed. This can be done by a very small staff of
                                high grade experts, perhaps one in each major field with small
                                supporting staffs.</p>
                            <p>The other aspect of occupation policy, control of which would be
                                transferred to the State Department, is the program of Japanese
                                economic recovery. If the concept of placing full responsibility on
                                the Japanese Government is applied here, only a very few United
                                States experts would be needed in Japan for supervisory
                                observation.</p>
                            <p>The procedure of creating special <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                                missions, small in size and recruited from United States Government
                                Departments and qualified civilians, which would go to Japan to
                                perform specific tasks on a temporary basis would meet new needs as
                                they may arise.</p>
                            <p>The Far Eastern geographical office in the Department of State would
                                be adequate, with perhaps a very small increase in personnel, to
                                take over responsibility in Washington for nongarrison aspects of
                                military occupation in Japan.</p>

                                October 9, 1948, states the broad, overall occupation objectives of
                                the United States for Japan. The underlying concept of this document
                                is that more responsibility should be placed upon the Japanese
                                Government, that occupation pressures upon the Japanese Government
                                and people should be relaxed, that the Japanese Government and
                                people should be permitted to assimilate the reform measures already
                                introduced; and that emphasis should be placed upon economic
                                recovery to the end that Japan <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676"

                                drawn up a year ago. In important respects, events in Japan have
                                caught up with its provisions. The irritations and counter impulses
                                attendant upon military occupation have steadily developed.</p>
                            <p>The placing upon the Japanese Government of full responsibility for
                                administration in Japan, subject only to overall supervisory control
                                by occupation authorities, the removal of the large civil affairs
                                occupation staff in Japan and its replacement by a small corps of
                                United States experts are fully in line with the concept of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2. As to attainment by Japan of
                                economic self-sufficiency, this will result <hi rend="underline"
                                    >only if the Japanese Government and people themselves assume

                            </p>
                            <p>In line with civilian United States authority becoming prominent in
                                the military occupation of Japan, it would be helpful if the
                                psychological impact of the occupation upon the Japanese people
                                could be improved by the return to Japanese use of as many as
                                practicable of office buildings in Tokyo and other industrial
                                centers. This could be accomplished by transferring the headquarters
                                of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> to some point outside
                                Japan and by transferring military occupation personnel to the
                                points where their garrisons are situated.</p>
                            <p>The transfer to the State Department of control of non-garrison
                                aspects of military occupation of Japan would thus be fully in line
                                with broad, overall occupation objectives. In fact the time has come
                                when we jeopardize fulfillment of those objectives by not proceeding
                                along the lines indicated in this memorandum. A Japanese desire to
                                learn democratic ways and to be friendly disposed toward the United
                                States, and avoidance of development of a Japanese desire for
                                revenge can be brought about only by Japan’s being afforded
                                opportunity to move definitely toward independence and self-respect
                                as a nation.</p>
                            <p>As will be apparent the issues discussed in this memorandum concern

                                            States civilian use. This is important as a symbol and
                                            psychologically. The Japanese would regard it as an
                                            important sign that civilian United States authority had
                                            become more important in the occupation, that a return
                                            to more normal international conditions had occurred,
                                            that the disabilities of military occupation were
                                            lessening. The United States Ambassador would be placed
                                            in a position analogous to that of the British
                                            Ambassador who occupies the British Embassy, of the
                                            Soviet Ambassador who occupies the Soviet Embassy and so
                                            forth.</p>

                                    n="1" xml:id="d41fn1">Not printed.</note> as alternatives I and
                                II two positions which the United States might take. These
                                alternatives, I am informed, are adapted from proposals which you
                                have had under consideration. Although alternative II would appear
                                to be in line with the latest recommendations from General MacArthur
                                and might appear preferable from an immediate point of view, taking
                                into account <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0096"/>the Japanese
                                stabilization program, nevertheless alternative I would appear to be
                                preferable if it will dispose of the problem with a greater degree
                                of finality and will make the greatest progress toward the
                                development of normal Japanese international relations. Also it has
                                been our understanding that alternative I corresponds to the
                                preference of the Department of State. However, the Department of
                                the Army would accept either of these alternatives, or a position
                                comparable thereto, if the one selected will be considered by the
                                Department of State as the “final settlement” of the Japanese
                                reparations problem and if the Department of State will agree to
                                discuss the proposed United States position with the Chairmen of the
                                Foreign Afairs, Appropriations, and possibly the Armed Services
                                Committees of Congress before this position is finally adopted as a
                                basis for negotiations with other countries.</p>
                            <p>As you know, the Department of the Army is anxious to establish as
                                quickly as possible a United States position on Japanese reparations
                                which, to the maximum degree possible, will dispel business and
                                financial uncertainty in Japan and which, in the near future, will
                                terminate costs to the Japanese government being expended to
                                maintain and guard possible reparations assets. A decision is needed
                                now in the interest of inducing Japanese economic recovery and a
                                status of self-support for Japan in order to lighten the United
                                States’ financial burden in connection with our responsibilities
                                inherent in the Japanese situation. This whole matter has been
                                thoroughly discussed with General MacArthur and further
                                consultations with the Supreme Commander, it is believed, would
                                serve no useful purpose. It is hoped that you will advise us of your
                                decision.</p>

                                February 8, 1949 the Japanese Government issued a Cabinet Order
                                establishing the Purge Review Commission. The Commission is under
                                the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister and is empowered to review
                                the appeals of political and economic purgees who initiate appeal
                                within three months of the establishment of the Commission. In the
                                case of persons purged in the future, the Commission is empowered to
                                hear their appeals initiated within three months of their
                                disqualification. The Japanese Government announced that the
                                establishment of this Commission does not constitute any attempt to
                                revise, reinterpret, or eliminate any of the existing purge
                                categories.</p>
                            <p>The jurisdiction of the Commission is further limited by the
                                interpretation of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                Headquarters, which understands that the following types of cases
                                will not be eligible for consideration by the Commission: (1)
                                Purgees who have previously appealed their disqualification and have
                                been denied reinstatement; and (2) purgees disqualified from public
                                office as a result of a <gloss target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss> or
                                by memorandum from any section of Headquarters.</p>
                            <p>There is no way to determine at the present time how many purgees
                                have appealed either to the old Purge Appeals Committee, which was
                                abolished in May 1948, or to the Purge Committee in the Prime
                                Minister’s Office, which during the interim from May 1948 to the
                                present has heard appeals and carried on routine screening
                                activities. In all probability a number of prominent purgees have
                                already made appeals which were denied, therefore making them
                                ineligible for re-appeal at this time.</p>
                            <p>According to the Japanese press, the Purge Review Commission formally
                                begins its work on March 8 and there are more than 1000 held-over
                                applications for reexamination and about 1000 other appeals made to
                                the Commission since its organization was first announced. Appeals
                                to be taken up for examination first by the New Purge Review
                                Commission are expected to be in the following categories: naval
                                officers, specialist officers, and graduates of the Naval Academy
                                after July 1945; Army officers, graduates of the Military Academy
                                after June 1945, or officers with ranks under colonel; in economic
                                circles, presidents of organizations and companies other than those
                                directly affiliated with the <hi rend="italic">Zaibatsu;</hi> in
                                press circles, directors and other responsible <pb n="685"
                                    xml:id="pg_685" facs="0099"/>persons of wartime newspapers, news
                                agencies, and publishing companies other than presidents and chief
                                editors. It is eventually expected that the Commission will handle
                                about 20,000 cases which may take as long as two years.</p>

                                member noted sinister implications of Soviet statement and said that
                                he would make no attempt at this time to give full reply. Length of
                                statement, its repetition of points raised in previous Soviet
                                statements on same subjects, language barrier and large number of
                                implications contained in it made it impossible for him to offer
                                more than a preliminary comment. He would say merely that most of
                                its substance had already been answered properly and truthfully by
                                his Govt. US, rather than flying in face of Commission policy, as
                                Mr. Panyushkin intimated, was doing its best to work with
                                Commission. US was not sinister power casting a shadow of monopoly
                                over Jap economy. It was instead encouraging economic recovery of
                                Japan. Unfortunately US was only power possessing capital to give
                                financial help to Japanese. <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0100"
                                />He wished other powers had capital available for such help, but
                                since they did not, his Govt could only hope they would help by
                                endeavoring to understand its efforts rather than by making such
                                hypocritical remarks as those just made by the Soviet
                                Representative.</p>
                            <p>USSR member asked US member to take back expressions such as
                                “sinister” and “hypocritical.” He added US had not yet proved it was
                                not violating policy decisions of <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>, and it had not given in essence a single

                                level but did not object if some details discussed working Comite.

                                France, India, USSR). USSR member again challenged ruling of Chair
                                that proposal was carried. Chairman’s ruling supported by NZ,

                                and since adherence Japan to <gloss target="#t_ITU1">ITU</gloss> was

                            <p>Austral member stated his Govt saw no objection why Japan should not
                                adhere to technical inter-governmental conventions. But from legal
                                point view he considered two questions involved: (<hi rend="italic"

                                to perform act of adherence to internatl convention and respect

                                permit such adherence. As to first point, he contended all aspects
                                Japan’s Fon relations must remain until peace conference in hands of
                                responsible auth, which he considered to be <gloss target="#t_FEC1"

                                as its agent. As to second point, he regarded <gloss

                                Japan’s adherence. He suggested <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>

                            <p>Under other business Phil member made statement on problem of Jap
                                reparations. He pointed out that his country’s concern and that of
                                all countries represented on Comm was problem of Jap in relation to
                                rest of area, in context of crisis that now grips world. Though Comm
                                had been in existence almost three years, it had yet to formulate
                                and implement a working program on econ life of Jap nation. It had
                                not solved problem of reparations because it had, so far, failed to
                                carry out the existing policy decision on level of econ life for
                                Jap. He noted that implementation of Para in the interim directive
                                on econ stabilization providing for “increased production of all
                                essential indigenous raw materials and manufactured products” could
                                not be accurately defined and determined except in relation to
                                comprehensive and detailed econ program for Jap. He pointed out that
                                rehabilitation of many of Jap’s neighbors and former victims
                                depended to a great extent on reparations they expected to get from
                                Jap and cited the Phil as a typical example. While Phil war damage
                                claim against Jap totaled <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0104"
                                />$5,375,000,000, as of Dec 23, 1948 it had recd interim reparations
                                amounting to only $11,390,000. He stated that change in policy on
                                reparations could throw entire Phil industrialization program out of
                                gear. Reparations would be decisive in determining future
                                relationship between Phil and Jap—whether former would revert to its
                                prewar position of being mere supplier of raw materials for Jap’s
                                factories, or achieve measure of self-sufficiency and independence
                                in its industrial needs. He added that Comm must act quickly.</p>
                            <p>He addressed a special appeal to US to make up its mind on what to do
                                with Jap. He cited as instance of US indecision, delay in removal of
                                aircraft and private munitions plants in Jap and referred to history
                                of inquiries on this matter in <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.
                                He also pointed out how lack of definitive US policy on final
                                position of Jap had led to indecision on industrial levels to be
                                maintained, extent of destruction of war-supporting industries and
                                machinery to be allocated as reparations “in excess of the peaceful
                                needs of the Japanese economy.”</p>
                            <p>He referred to vicious circle existing between reparations, level of
                                econ life, comprehensive over-all policy on relation of Japan to her
                                neighbors and changed polit and econ states of Asian nations as well
                                as their plans for future—plans based at least in part on
                                destruction of Jap’s war-making capacity and distribution of some of
                                its industrial machinery as reparations.</p>
                            <p>Regardless of its effect on Jap economy his Govt held that Jap must
                                be stripped of all war and war-supporting industries, such as
                                aircraft and munitions factories—with respect to non-military items,
                                his Govt held that need of claimant countries should have priority
                                over need of Jap, wherever it could be demonstrated that these
                                countries could take over such machinery to replace what they lost
                                or to raise themselves to level where they would not be subj to the
                                domination of revived Jap industries or to polit and milit threat
                                that would follow such industrial revival. He noted that history in
                                Asia was moving with dynamic force and jet propelled speed and
                                concluded that welfare of peoples and peace of world required that
                                Comm make new and resolute effort to settle problem of Jap without
                                further delay.</p>
                            <p>USSR member noted that question of labor policy in Jap had been
                                dropped from agenda and protested that no differentiation was made
                                in Terms of Reference between procedural and substantive matters. US
                                member indicated that any member could introduce a subj at will or
                                make any statement under “other business” at any mtg.</p>

                            <p>US Member proposed that paper be amended to extend period to July 1,
                                1949, instead of Dec. 31 as now provided in paper, and stated that
                                govts eligible under <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–280/9 had
                                not made full use of time available to them up to present. US
                                amendment failed to receive any support in Commission. Indian,
                                Netherlands, Philippine, Australian and Soviet members pointed out
                                that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> procedure for
                                implementation of directive was issued only on Aug 6 and that actual
                                inspection began only last part of Aug. These members emphasized
                                difficulty their govts encountered to find qualified technical
                                experts, to decide what they wanted in Japan, and to arrange for
                                transportation. Netherlands member pointed out that his govt had
                                wanted to give Indonesia first opportunity to make use of time in
                                Japan and that time was lost when it was found that Indonesia could
                                supply only one technical expert of broad qualifications. Australian
                                member indicated that his govt had been negotiating for almost six
                                months with <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> over a particular
                                process and just now when it was expected that negotiations would be
                                brought to a successful conclusion, the program would be suddenly
                                finished and all their months of negotiation would be lost. Soviet
                                member contended that conditions of work under which experts were to
                                receive technical information were not favorable. Australia,
                                Philippines, India and Netherlands indicated strong desire to send
                                technicians if policy adequately extended. US Member stated that in
                                order to be as helpful as possible in meeting present deadline, he
                                would ask his govt to consider requesting <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> to allow technicians now present in Japan to
                                continue their investigations until July 1 provided it was
                                feasible.</p>

                                have been several exchanges of letters between our two Departments
                                on the subject of replacement of cultural objects lost or destroyed
                                as a result of Japanese aggression. I have reference particularly to
                                a letter of July 28, 1948, from Secretary Royall to Secretary
                                Marshall; Secretary Marshall’s reply of September 18; a letter of

                                to inform the Commission that it is the view of this Government that
                                this matter is not one which can properly be dealt with during the
                                occupation but should be considered on its merits if introduced at

                                <p>You are authorized to inform the Commission that it is the view
                                    of the United States Government that the matter of replacement
                                    of cultural objects lost or destroyed as a result of Japanese
                                    aggression is one which, in contradistinction to the restitution
                                    of cultural objects, cannot properly be dealt with during the
                                    occupation. It is the position of the United States that
                                    proposals for a program of replacement of cultural objects
                                    should, as has been the case in Europe, be considered on their
                                    merits if introduced at the time of the peace conference. You
                                    are accordingly instructed to oppose <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                                <p>You may at your discretion advise the Commission that the United
                                    States Government appreciates the profound sense of injury of
                                    those of its Allies which suffered looting of their cultural
                                    heritage at Japan’s hands, and that the above position arises
                                    not out of lack of sympathy for those nations in their loss but
                                    only from the conviction that proposals for partial redress of
                                    the loss through replacement from Japan’s cultural store cannot
                                    properly be acted upon in advance of the peace conference.</p>

                            <p>It seems to me that this paper brings to the front two basic
                                questions: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The problem of anticipating and preparing for a degree of
                                        rearmament of Japan; and</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The problem of military security of the Japanese
                                        islands.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>With reference to the first problem, Secretary Royall and General
                                MacArthur are agreed that it would be inadvisable for a long time to
                                come to permit the establishment of Japanese armed forces. You will
                                recall General MacArthur’s remarks to me on this subject when I was
                                out there in February. I am inclined to agree with them. I would add
                                that in considering the question of re-armament of Japan it is
                                important to bear in mind the attitude of the Japanese themselves.
                                It was the Emperor who on the night he ordered Japan to surrender
                                stated in unequivocal terms that Japan would never again have
                                military forces. The idea of a pacifist state perhaps was not widely
                                held in Japan and frankly is contrary to their entire history, but
                                nevertheless it was held in the highest quarters. Those quarters, as
                                we have witnessed during the occupation, go a long way toward
                                determining how the Japanese people think. Accordingly it would be
                                wise before going too far in any planning to determine the attitudes
                                and inclinations of Japan’s leaders. I think it would be taking a
                                grave risk to attempt to sound out Japanese thinking on this
                                delicate subject during the period of the occupation, and without a
                                great deal of exploration I would strongly recommend against it.</p>
                            <p>There is much that can and should be done, however, under <gloss

                                7, “The Japanese Police Establishment” which states:</p>

                            </quote>
                            <p>I perceive no real obstacle to the creation of police reserves,
                                located on the outskirts or near by concentrations of population or
                                in other strategic <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0109"/>centers,

                            <p>With regard to the second question which is the <gloss
                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendation that it would be
                                unwise to postpone “consideration of the problem of Japanese
                                military security until such time as peace treaty negotiations may
                                be undertaken”, I wholeheartedly agree with the <gloss
                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. I would suggest, however, that
                                they have misinterpreted paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> 13/2, which, I believe, was intended to cover the
                                question of controls to be, or not to be, written into the peace
                                treaty as well as the question whether Japan’s integrity would be
                                guaranteed by internacional agreement or by the United States. I do
                                not believe that paragraph 4 was intended in any way to place any
                                limitation upon the planning by the National Military Establishment
                                for such security arrangements as may be necessary in that part of
                                the world to protect the United States and its interests.</p>
                            <p>I should, therefore, recommend that if my interpretation of paragraph
                                4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/2 is correct the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NME1">NME</gloss> be advised that there is no
                                limitation on United States planning in this respect. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will, of course, be concerned not
                                only with the present situation, but also with the post-treaty
                                situation. In the latter connection my recommendation would be that
                                the United States should allow the Japanese themselves to decide
                                whether or not they will have military forces in the post-treaty
                                period. I believe that it would be wise until we have evidence to
                                the contrary to plan U.S. security in that part of the world on the
                                assumption that Japan will remain to all intents and purposes a
                                military vacuum. I have been under the assumption that U.S. security
                                in that part of the world as well as the military security of the
                                Japanese islands can be maintained from bases not on the main
                                Japanese islands. You will recall that it is General MacArthur’s
                                concept that the Japanese islands should be militarily neutralized
                                (Russia and other hostile forces kept out) by superior United States
                                air and naval forces based principally in the Ryukyu Islands. We
                                are, of course, well aware that the Navy considers the Ryukyus
                                totally inadequate and believes that the only suitable naval bases
                                are to be found in Japan. This is a difference of view which only
                                military experts can reconcile.</p>
                            <p>To refer once again to General MacArthur’s views, you will remember
                                that he told me that he thought it was highly probable that if war
                                came the Japanese would be fighting on our side before it was over.
                                I would certainly be in favor of using Japanese manpower in our war
                                effort if that were militarily feasible and agreeable to the
                                Japanese. I can see no objection to the <gloss target="#t_NME1"

                            <p>In the light of the evident trend toward world unrest and in view of
                                the fact that it may well become extremely important to our national
                                security for Japan to be capable of providing some degree of
                                military assistance to the United States, at least to the extent of
                                Japan’s own self-defense, it appears desirable that the question of
                                the possible use of Japanese armed forces be carefully explored.</p>
                            <p>In the light of United States commitments to disarm and demilitarize
                                Japan, of the whole concept of the occupation and of the
                                sensibilities of our Allies and former friends who share in the
                                regime of control of Japan, any consideration of this question must
                                be undertaken only under extremely tight security requirements.</p>

                            <p>Phil member stated his Govt takes position that International
                                Convention of Telecommunications is properly open for accession only
                                to nations endowed with full legal capacity, that Japan, being
                                technically still an enemy nation, does not possess that legal
                                capacity. It was his view that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                policy decision, Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan, made clear
                                that Japan could not properly adhere to any internatl agreement
                                pending conclusion peace treaty. His Govt considered this principle
                                to be valid and binding unless Commission itself deems it necessary
                                to provide for exceptions. He noted that because of special
                                technical nature of convention a reasonable case cld be made out for
                                Japanese participation. But, he added, general principle continues
                                to be valid and must stand as enunciated by this Commission. Since
                                it was Commission that laid down this principle, only Commission
                                itself has power to determine when exceptions may be made. This
                                power obviously cannot be delegated to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>, whose wide discretion in matters of policy
                                enforcement, especially on domestic matters, does not include
                                discretion to set aside basic policy decision of Commission on Fon
                                affairs of Japan. He referred to Art. 18 of Convention which
                                provides that “Members of the Union may declare at any time that
                                their acceptance of this Convention applies to all, or a group, or a
                                single one of the countries or territories for whose foreign
                                relations they are responsible” and stated that if Japan’s accession
                                to Convention is covered by Art, it follows that phrase “members of
                                the Union” would apply not to any one of members of Commission but
                                to all members of body jointly, since it is they, acting as <gloss

                                give its sanction to accomplished fact and that since Commission had
                                laid down general rule, representations in favor of Japanese
                                participation should have been made to that body. The reverse,
                                however, had happened and practical considerations might incline the

                                <p>“As regards Japan, I said the Far Eastern Commission had become
                                    useless, since it had become a forum for Soviet complaints.
                                    However, we will let it go its way. Since the U.S. is spending
                                    about 900 million dollars a year in Japan, MacArthur has been
                                    told to take more vigorous steps toward recovery. While
                                    reparations in themselves are not much of a drain, they are a
                                    confusing factor in the Japanese economy and we shall let them
                                    fall into oblivion. There was small chance of a treaty being
                                    concluded, and as far as I knew, no work was being done along
                                    these lines at present.”</p>

                                Authorized Area”. In the final sentence of this despatch, the
                                Department’s instructions are invited as to what type of reply might
                                appropriately be made to Soviet complaints of alleged violations by
                                Japanese vessels of “Soviet territorial waters”.</p>
                            <p>The Department is in agreement with the Officer in Charge that the
                                Soviet Member, Allied Council for Japan, is exploiting the
                                opportunity which these alleged violations afford to advance Soviet
                                territorial claims to islands adjacent to Northern Hokkaido. The
                                Department supports the intention of the Officer in Charge to avoid,
                                in the course of Headquarters correspondence with the Soviet Member,
                                any acknowledgment of Soviet territorial claims. No objection is
                                perceived to replying to further Soviet complaints on this subject,
                                provided no implied or direct expression of United States views on
                                territorial questions is given.</p>

                            <p>Admitting that no proposal can fully meet all desiderata, the
                                outstanding advantages of this position are that it violates no
                                earlier commitments of this Government, while at the same time
                                affording maximum support to the Japanese stabilization and recovery
                                objectives. Although it will undoubtedly occasion criticism by other
                                claimant countries, it will be difficult for these countries to
                                attack us merely for refusing to exercise our powers of unilateral
                                action to solve the reparations problem. Our announcement that we
                                propose no further unilateral action to overcome the apparently
                                insoluble shares stalemate, plus the evidence of our position in
                                point 4, should afford the Japanese business community assurance it
                                now lacks that it is highly unlikely that any further reparations
                                removals will take place and, accordingly, that they may
                                rehabilitate their plants in confidence.</p>
                            <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0116"/>
                            <p>With reference to your desire that the position selected be
                                considered by the Department of State as the “final settlement” of
                                the Japanese reparations question, there is unfortunately no way in
                                which a final settlement of this problem can be assured before the
                                peace settlement. It is believed, however, that the position set
                                forth above will for all intents and purposes be final, and that it
                                will be recognized as such in this country and in Japan.
                                Modifications of this position in an attempt to render it more
                                unquestionably final could be only partially effective at best and
                                would expose this Government, in my view unnecessarily, to charges
                                of illegality and failure to live up to its international
                                commitments.</p>
                            <p>Both of the alternative proposals advanced in your letter provide
                                that the United States should direct <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> to arrange for the return to the Japanese economy
                                in a fully normal status of all assets in Japan heretofore
                                considered available or potentially available for reparations, and
                                for the cessation of custodial and maintenance costs borne by the
                                Japanese Government in connection with such assets.</p>
                            <p>Although this Department fully shares your desires on this point, it
                                feels that, so far as primary war facilities are concerned, this
                                Government is without power to direct <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> as you propose in view of the explicit provision
                                in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decision on
                                “Reduction of Japanese Industrial War Potential” that primary war
                                facilities shall be “impounded”. <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> is empowered, however, by paragraph 10 of this
                                decision to except temporarily (which could well be for the duration
                                of the occupation) from the impounding and other requirements of
                                that policy decision and to permit the use of any primary war
                                facilities deemed necessary for needs of the occupation, which needs
                                now prominently include economic recovery. In so far as other
                                reparations facilities are concerned, it is my understanding that
                                there is no <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> decision requiring
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to impound or maintain
                                such facilities and that he is already empowered to permit the
                                Japanese full use, short of scrapping, of such facilities. It is
                                believed that these powers on the part of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>, coupled with the course of action set forth in
                                paragraph 4 of the proposed position of the United States, will
                                effectively accomplish our common purpose without requiring this
                                Government to direct <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> contrary
                                to an earlier <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> decision.</p>
                            <p>If it should prove to be desirable or necessary, I would be willing
                                to discuss or to have a State Department representative discuss this
                                matter with the Chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Appropriations and
                                Armed Services Committees of Congress. I feel, however, that such
                                discussion may not be necessary in view of the position we propose
                                to take.</p>

                                        <item>Some months ago I was informed—and this has been my
                                            understanding until I had the privilege of reading the
                                            pending U.S. draft settlement—that the United States
                                            Government, after it had tentatively adopted a
                                            reparations policy, would (1) present this policy to and
                                            discuss it with representatives of the other states on

                                            conversations conducted by officials of the State
                                            Department; (2) consider the possibility of modifying
                                            the United States position in view of the expressions of
                                            opinion by other states; (3) submit the U.S. policy,
                                            possibly modified, to the Far Eastern Commission with
                                            the understanding that the United States would take into
                                            consideration the views expressed in the discussion; and
                                            (4) determine the final United States position, either
                                            the original policy or that policy amended in the light
                                            of discussions, and put this policy into effect, if
                                            necessary, by an interim directive.</item>

                                        <item>In my judgment, it would further the interests of the

                                            Far Eastern Commission and would fulfill the obligations
                                            of the United States to support the principle of
                                            international cooperation, if the Secretary of State
                                            could find it possible to modify the present draft U.S.
                                            policy so that the proposed reparations settlement would
                                            be presented (1) in diplomatic bilateral conversations
                                            to representatives of the states on the Far Eastern

                                            modified its policy as a result of the views expressed,
                                            it would be a matter of great importance that the other

                                letter.</p>
                            <p>I fully understand and share your desire that our Japanese
                                reparations position accord with the basic United States policy of
                                settling international problems by international cooperation. As you
                                say, it was thought some months ago when the possibility of
                                utilizing our interim directive power to make possible the delivery
                                of additional reparations was being considered, that opportunity
                                might be afforded other <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> nations
                                to express their views on the quantities of facilities to be made
                                available from particular industries under our proposal, and that we
                                should stand ready to alter our proposal within rather narrowly
                                defined limits to meet their views if we might thereby increase its
                                overall acceptability. It has now been decided, however, on the
                                basis of the most thorough investigation and General MacArthur’s
                                personal appraisal of the situation following receipt of the recent
                                stabilization directive, that the United States cannot support
                                further reparations removals from Japan,—certainly not on a scale
                                which would have any chance of acceptance by the other <gloss

                                course in the circumstances is to let the reparations issue atrophy.
                                In this connection you will be interested in the following excerpt
                                from a memorandum of the Secretary’s conversation of April 2 with
                                Mr. Bevin:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“…<note n="2" xml:id="d57fn2">Omissions as indicated in the
                                        source text.</note> Since the U.S. is spending about 900
                                    million dollars a year in Japan, MacArthur has been told to take
                                    more vigorous steps toward recovery. While reparations in
                                    themselves are not much of a drain, they are a confusing factor
                                    in the Japanese economy and we shall let them fall into oblivion
                                    …”</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>You will note that the only <hi rend="italic">faits accomplis</hi>
                                with which other claimant nations will be presented under our
                                proposed position will be the rescission of the Advance Transfer
                                directive and withdrawal of our shares proposal of November, 1947.
                                As you will recall, these two measures were the result solely of
                                United States initiative, responsibility and action. The rest of our
                                position is restricted to a denial of intention to take unilateral
                                action to make additional reparations available, and to an
                                expression of United States policy views that Japanese resources <pb
                                    n="708" xml:id="pg_708" facs="0122"/>should be utilized for
                                recovery purposes to the maximum extent permitted by existing <gloss

                                no limitation on levels of Japanese peaceful productive capacity.
                                The U.S. proposal as a whole is to be explained to representatives
                                of the friendly <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> nations in the
                                context of our overall Japan policies before action of any sort is
                                taken, and full opportunity will of course be afforded for
                                discussion of the U.S. expression of views in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> following your announcement of our
                                position to the Commission and submission of this Government’s new
                                policy proposals.</p>
                            <p>Although possibilities of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                nations accepting these proposals are remote, it is important that
                                we make every effort to persuade as many nations as possible of the
                                reasonableness of our position. It is for this purpose that the
                                Secretary or his designee will invite representatives of the
                                friendly <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> nations to the State
                                Department to advise them of our position and to explain the
                                considerations underlying that position. I am sure that I speak for
                                the Secretary in saying that your assistance in further clarifying
                                our position to your colleagues on the Commission after its
                                announcement would be invaluable in minimizing opposition to it,
                                and, possibly, in securing a growing measure of acceptance for our
                                policy proposals.</p>
                            <p>With reference to your comments on certain details of the proposed
                                U.S. position, you are correct in your assumption that the United
                                States will continue to oppose reparations from current production.
                                The statement in paragraph 5 of our proposed position that “there
                                should be no further industrial reparations removals from Japan” is
                                intended to cover reparations from current production as well as
                                from existing capital equipment. The statement is also so drafted as
                                not to infringe in any way our commitment for the removal of gold,
                                silver and precious stones as reparations, a commitment which is
                                subject, however, to the first charge principle on repayment of
                                occupation costs.</p>
                            <p>I much appreciate the spirit of helpfulness which prompted you to
                                make the comments which you have sent us, and assure you that those
                                of us responsible for Japanese affairs within the Department of
                                State fully share your desire that our Japan policies be at all
                                times based on the principle of international cooperation.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            <p>I had lunch today with General Pechkoff, the French representative in
                                Tokyo who is a diplomat, a soldier, a former administrator in Syria
                                and, incidentally, the illegitimate son of Gorki. He, too, thinks it
                                is important that we change rapidly the character of the occupation
                                if a peace treaty is not to come to pass in the near future.
                                Pechkoff is a very shrewd and interesting man and since he will be
                                here until Thursday, I hope that you will have an opportunity to
                                receive him.<note n="5" xml:id="d58fn5">An appointment was made for

                                Japan has stated adherence to convention does not mean that it is
                                entitled to send delegates to conference. He pointed out however

                                stated that Japan does not possess legal capacity to adhere to
                                internatl conventions. USSR member repeated contention that Japan’s
                                adherence was illegal in view Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan
                                which authorizes Japan to have functions only in domestic

                                15, 7 p. m. General MacArthur has informed me that he fully concurs
                                in the State–Army proposed policy decision for introduction April 21

                                objective of Supreme Commander to encourage the development in Japan
                                of respect for rights of other nations and to facilitate progressive
                                resumption by Japan of normal international responsibilities. In
                                this purpose, and subject to the Supreme Commander’s discretion and
                                continued control, participation by Japan with other nations or
                                groups of nations in such international relations, conventions,
                                meetings, Consular arrangements, or other bilateral or multilateral
                                accords as Japan may be invited to enter into, accede to, attend, or
                                participate in, and as he shall consider to be in the interests of
                                and in consonance with objectives of the occupation, should, in his
                                view, be encouraged by all appropriate means.</p>
                            <p>He further considers it to be in the interest of healthy
                                international relations that responsible governments should now
                                welcome full exercise by Japan of her rights of membership in the
                                International Telecommunication Union and hopes that the United
                                States Government will support the position that to limit Japan’s
                                participations to any other basis would be inadequate, niggardly,
                                and unjustifiable.</p>
                            <p>General MacArthur considers indefensible the position now advanced by
                                the French Government that Japan, having been admitted to full
                                membership in International Telecommunication Union in strict
                                conformity with protocol adopted at plenary session Atlantic City
                                Conference, should not now be invited for participation in
                                conference to full extent envisaged in protocol. He furthermore
                                feels that recourse by French Government at this late date to
                                argument that Far Eastern Commission alone is competent authority,
                                to the exclusion of Supreme Commander’s prerogatives, is an
                                unwarranted assumption of political authority and decision which
                                French Government does not in fact possess. In consequence, he

                            <p>US Member stated it was view his Govt that matter of replacement
                                cultural objects lost or destroyed as result of Jap aggression is
                                one which, in contradistinction to restitution of cultural objects,
                                cannot properly be dealt with during occupation. He added that it is
                                US position that proposals for program of replacement cultural
                                objects shld, as has been case in Europe, be considered on their
                                merits if introduced at time of peace conference. He pointed out
                                that US appreciates profound sense of injury of those of its Allies
                                which suffered looting of their cultural heritage at Japan’s hands
                                and that US position arises not out of lack of sympathy for these
                                nations in their loss but only from consideration that proposals for
                                partial redress of loss through replacement from Japan’s cultural
                                store cannot properly be acted upon in advance of peace

                            <p>Potsdam Declaration envisaged establishment responsible Jap Govt. In
                                Basic Post Surrender Policy <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                countries agreed to help Jap develop econ and cultural intercourse
                                with other countries and bring Japs into permanent peaceful
                                relationship with all nations. Also agreed ultimate objective
                                establish democratic and peaceful Jap Govt which will carry out its
                                internatl responsibilities and respect rights of other states.</p>
                            <p>Since democratic and responsible Jap Govt now established <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries should take leadership in
                                supporting gradual and progressive resumption by Jap of internatl
                                responsibilities under guiding hand <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>. Realistic approach necessary in view delay Peace
                                Treaty and lapse of almost four years since surrender.</p>
                            <p>Jap need benefits and guidance of direct contacts with other Govts
                                and people. Participation by Jap in internatl relations will thus
                                foster basic objectives and help dissipate vestiges of wartime
                                hatred and bitterness. Furthermore allied nations and peoples will
                                gain knowledge of new Jap through direct contacts.</p>

                                will further his objectives. Policy also desirable for improvement
                                relations between Jap and all other countries.</p>
                            <p>You may also point out to <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>
                                that this is a problem which should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be
                                approached from standpoint legal technicalities involving long and
                                fruitless debates; but rather from standpoint of broad political
                                implications of situation in Jap and in world at large. Peace
                                continues to be denied Japs without blame on their part. There is
                                growing uneasiness among Japs who face increasing hardship. The
                                heavy burden upon limited US resources continues. Foregoing policy
                                will be one step to decrease tension and to promote Jap trade and
                                thus alleviate US burden. Japs will either move toward sound
                                friendly relationships with non-communist powers or into association
                                communist power system in Asia. To abandon Jap to latter and
                                unreasonably to deny them entrance into relationships with our
                                nations and peoples would be to undo our costly victory in the
                                Pacific.</p>

                                <p>“The Japanese reparations problem has been one of the most
                                    important and pressing questions with which the Far Eastern
                                    Commission and its member countries have had to deal. The United
                                    States, on its part, has taken a long and continuing interest in
                                    this problem and has been keenly aware of the interest of the
                                    other <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries in finding a
                                    reasonable solution to it. It is to be regretted that this
                                    controversial issue which for such a long time has proved
                                    incapable of solution by this Commission continues to retard the
                                    achievement of economic self-support by Japan, which is so
                                    greatly in the interest of our common objectives with respect to
                                    that country.</p>
                                <p>“In our discussions of the matter here in the Commission we have
                                    proceeded from the agreement contained in the Potsdam
                                    Declaration that reparations would be exacted from Japan and
                                    that they should be in a form which would not impair the ability
                                    of the Japanese people to support themselves. From the earliest
                                    days of the Far Eastern Commission the United States has been
                                    guided by a desire that the victims of Japanese aggression
                                    receive as reparations such of Japan’s resources as was possible
                                    without jeopardizing Japan’s ability to meet its own peaceful
                                    needs. The United States has felt, further, that in order that
                                    the nations devastated by Japan might receive reparation while
                                    their need was greatest, in order that there might be removed
                                    from the mind of the Japanese Government and people uncertainty

                                    reparations question, and in order that as many as possible of
                                    Japan’s post-war obligations might be disposed of during the
                                    period of the occupation, a reparations program should be worked
                                    out and put into effect at the earliest practical moment.</p>
                                <p>“These factors led the United States Government to take the
                                    initiative in making a number of policy proposals to the Far
                                    Eastern Commission. In April, 1946, the United States submitted
                                    to the Far Eastern Commission a pattern of proposals providing
                                    that there should be made immediately available for reparations
                                    designated quantities of industrial facilities which were at
                                    that time considered to be clearly surplus to Japan’s peaceful
                                    needs. Between May and December of that year the Commission
                                    adopted a series of Interim Reparations Policy decisions based
                                    upon these U.S. proposals, but the subsequent inability of the
                                    Commission to agree on a schedule of shares for division of the
                                    facilities among the claimant countries prevented implementation
                                    of the decisions. In April, 1947, the U.S. Government offered
                                    further proposals, which would have had the effect of making
                                    known to Japan precisely, and on a final basis, what industrial
                                    capacity should be considered by that country to be immune from
                                    removal as reparations and what should be eligible for removal.
                                    In the same month, the U.S. because of its desire to work toward
                                    a settlement of this matter issued a unilateral interim
                                    directive, under authority granted in paragraph III, 3, of the
                                    Terms of Reference of the Far Eastern Commission, instructing
                                    the Supreme Commander to effect delivery to four of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries of 30 percent of the
                                    facilities which the Far Eastern Commission itself had
                                    previously determined in the Interim Removals decisions to be
                                    available for reparations removal. Issuance of this directive
                                    was motivated in part by a desire to assist those countries
                                    which had in the course of fighting against Japan’s aggression
                                    on their own territories suffered most grievously, but it was
                                    also motivated by a desire to prompt <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                        >FEC</gloss> countries to agree upon a reparations program
                                    from which all eleven countries might benefit.</p>
                                <p>“In November, 1947, the United States Government took the
                                    initiative once more in an effort to end the stalemate within
                                    the Commission on the question of reparations shares, a
                                    stalemate which continued to make it impossible for any of the
                                    Commission’s decisions on the reparations problem to take
                                    practical effect. This U.S. proposal contained the provision
                                    that if the Far Eastern Commission countries would accept the
                                    schedule of percentages which had been worked out by the U.S.
                                    Government—on the basis of prolonged exchanges of views among
                                    Commission members as to the equities involved—the U.S.
                                    Government, on its part, would make available virtually all of
                                    its own share for distribution among the countries which could
                                    accept the U.S. proposal as a whole. Sixteen months have passed
                                    and this proposal has not been accepted by the Commission.</p>
                                <p>“I should like to emphasize at this point that the action of my
                                    Government, and, it is assumed, of the other Member Governments,
                                    in participating in the policy decisions which have been taken
                                    by the Commission on the question of reparations was predicated
                                    upon two basic assumptions, namely, that the resources to be
                                    removed from Japan as reparations were clearly excess to the
                                    peaceful needs of a self-supporting Japanese economy, and that
                                    there would be a shares schedule acceptable to and agreed upon

                                    proportions available reparations should be divided.</p>
                                <p>“As I have already stated, and as the Commission well knows, the
                                    second of these assumptions has not been realized and there
                                    seems little prospect of its being realized. As regards the
                                    first assumption, that reparations removals should be limited to
                                    facilities clearly excess to the needs of a self-supporting
                                    Japanese economy, successive studies during the past eighteen
                                    months of Japan’s future industrial requirements have
                                    necessitated progressive upward adjustments of earlier estimates
                                    of these requirements. The first of these studies was that of
                                    Overseas Consultants, Incorporated, whose report was made
                                    available to the Commission on March 2, 1948, and the second was
                                    that of the so-called Johnston Committee, whose report was made
                                    available to the Commission on May 19, 1948. Both of these
                                    reports came to the sober conclusion that the quantity of
                                    capital equipment in Japan which could be properly considered in
                                    excess of Japan’s peaceful needs had been greatly overestimated.
                                    Both reports indicated that for a variety of reasons the
                                    Japanese economy was continuing to operate at a heavy deficit
                                    even though living standards remained at a level, and that the
                                    end to these deficits is not in sight. The evidence contained in
                                    these reports, and the common knowledge of all Far Eastern
                                    Commission countries, leads to the inescapable conclusion that
                                    the Japanese economy can be made to bear additional economic
                                    burdens, beyond those directly related to meeting its own
                                    requirements, only by prolonging or increasing the staggering
                                    costs borne by the American taxpayer.</p>
                                <p>“The United States has, since the time of the Japanese surrender,
                                    carried the burden of preventing such disease and unrest in
                                    Japan as might jeopardize the purposes of the occupation. The
                                    critical economic conditions with which, it is now apparent,
                                    Japan is faced, and the prospect of continuing deficits in
                                    Japan’s international payments for some years to come, render
                                    measures of Japanese economic recovery of utmost importance. It
                                    is inescapable that if the basic purposes of the occupation are
                                    to be achieved, the Japanese people must be enabled to support
                                    themselves at a tolerable standard of living. No one could
                                    reasonably suggest that Japan should be abandoned to economic
                                    despair. So to abandon Japan would be to undo the costly victory
                                    in the Pacific.</p>
                                <p>“I am sure that other Commission countries agree with my
                                    Government that the Japanese people themselves must exert
                                    maximum efforts for the attainment of recovery. For some months
                                    the U.S. Government has explored means whereby this objective
                                    could best be achieved. In issuing its directive of December 10
                                    regarding Japan’s economic stabilization, the U.S. Government
                                    took a major step towards requiring the Japanese people to exert
                                    their utmost energies in stabilizing their economy and reducing
                                    their dependence for subsistence on foreign subsidy. Under
                                    present circumstances in Japan the cost of dismantling, packing,
                                    and transporting reparations facilities would conflict with the
                                    program of Japan’s economic stabilization and would constitute
                                    an additional financial burden upon the U.S. Government. I do
                                    not wish to emphasize this point unduly, but the U.S. Government
                                    would be lacking in candor if it did not point out that the
                                    resources at its disposal to meet demands from all parts of the
                                    world are limited.</p>
                                <p>“Japan today has no resources surplus to its peaceful needs.
                                    Thus, it is now apparent to the U.S. Government that the first
                                    as well as the <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0133"/>second
                                    of the two basic assumptions mentioned earlier, assumptions
                                    which underlay the policy decisions of the <gloss

                                    and are a precondition for an <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                        >FEC</gloss> reparations program, has not been realized.
                                    This fact has led my Government to several conclusions. Before
                                    stating them, however, I wish to emphasize that the U.S.
                                    Government maintains fully and categorically its support of the
                                    principle adopted by the Far Eastern Commission that Japan’s
                                    war-making capacity should be eliminated. As you know, all of
                                    Japan’s specialized war-making facilities have been destroyed.
                                    The U.S. Government believes that all other equipment used for
                                    war purposes in the past should, if retained in Japan, be fully
                                    converted to the purposes of and utilized in Japan’s peaceful
                                    economy. Where this cannot be done, the U.S. Government believes
                                    that such equipment should be scrapped. The U.S. will not permit
                                    difficulties in reaching a solution of the reparations problem
                                    to be a means whereby Japan’s war capacity might re-emerge.</p>
                                <p>“It may not be amiss at this point to recall that Japan has
                                    already been deprived not only of all of its overseas
                                    territorial possessions, but also of substantial quantities of
                                    real property of Japanese ownership and origin in the former
                                    possessions and elsewhere abroad. This property constitutes a
                                    large payment which the Japanese have already made towards
                                    satisfaction of their reparations obligations. Unfortunately,
                                    from the standpoint of equity, some countries have benefited
                                    more than others in the reparations that they have obtained in
                                    this form. However, from the standpoint of Japan, the loss of
                                    these properties, whatever the proportions in which they happen
                                    to have been distributed, drastically reduces Japan’s ability to
                                    support even at a minimum level the needs of its people.</p>

                                    had no bearing on the matter of future levels of industrial
                                    capacity in Japan. Turning now to this latter question, I have
                                    already emphasized my Government’s support of the principle that
                                    Japan’s capacity to make war should not be permitted to
                                    re-emerge. It is the considered view of the United States
                                    Government that this objective does not require that Japan’s
                                    production for peaceful purposes be limited or that limitations
                                    be imposed on levels of Japanese productive capacity in
                                    industries devoted to peaceful purposes. This belief, coupled
                                    with the evidence of Japan’s present economic plight and the
                                    difficult problems Japan will face in future in attaining levels
                                    of industrial production and foreign trade sufficient to support
                                    its people even at minimum levels, render it clearly advisable
                                    in my Government’s view that Japan be permitted to develop its
                                    peaceful industries without limitation. The problem facing us is
                                    not one of limitation of Japan’s peaceful industries but of
                                    reviving these industries to provide the people’s barest
                                    wants.</p>

                                Japanese participation in international relations in advance of the
                                formal introduction of the policy in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> by the United States. A copy of the proposed policy

                            <p>Mr. Bishop explained to the representatives present that it was the
                                feeling of the U.S. Government that since a democratic and
                                responsible Japanese Government has been established, it was now
                                time that the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries should
                                take leadership in supporting the gradual and progressive assumption
                                by Japan of its international responsibilities under the guiding
                                hand of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. He indicated that it
                                is our view that a realistic approach to this matter is now
                                necessary in view of the peace treaty delay and the lapse of almost
                                four years time since the surrender of Japan. Mr. Bishop pointed out
                                that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> has informed the United
                                States that such a policy will further his objectives in the
                                occupation of Japan.</p>
                            <p>He invited attention to the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> Basic
                                Post-Surrender Policy in which the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> countries agreed to help Japan develop economic and
                                cultural intercourse with other countries and bring Japan into
                                permanent peaceful relationship with all nations. He also pointed
                                out that one of the ultimate objectives agreed upon in this <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy was to establish a
                                democratic and peaceful Japanese Government which would carry out
                                its international responsibilities and would respect the rights of
                                other states. Mr. Bishop went on to point out that the <pb n="722"
                                    xml:id="pg_722" facs="0136"/>proposed policy was in line with
                                the aforementioned <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> Basic Post
                                Surrender Policy.</p>
                            <p>The reaction of the representatives present was in general one of
                                reserve regarding the details of the proposed policy but was
                                favorable to the principle of allowing some resumption of Japanese
                                participation in international relations. They all indicated,
                                however, that it would be necessary for them to obtain the views of
                                their governments before they could discuss the proposal in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. Mr. Bishop emphasized that
                                we of course did not expect them to be able to express more than
                                their personal views before hearing from their governments.</p>
                            <p>Some of the representatives present said that the proposed policy
                                raised several legal questions in connection with an exchange of
                                official representatives between Japan and other countries. Mr.
                                Bishop indicated that it was our hope that the subject would not be
                                approached from the standpoint of legal technicalities, but rather
                                that it would be accepted from the standpoint of the broad political
                                implications of the situation in Japan and in the world at large. He
                                emphasized that the proposal was purposely drafted in very broad
                                terms, and that it should be borne in mind that before Japan
                                participates in international relations she must (1) be invited to
                                enter into such relationships, (2) <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> must approve, and (3) <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> must consider such participation to be in the
                                interests of the occupation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bishop said that Japan needed the benefits and guidance of direct
                                contacts with other governments and people, and furthermore other
                                countries would benefit by gaining a direct knowledge of the new
                                Japan. He indicated that we envisaged a gradual resumption by Japan
                                of its participation in international relationships. He noted that
                                there were many routine, but nevertheless important, functions of an
                                international character which the Japanese can and should
                                immediately assume in regard to such matters as trade, property, and
                                citizenship.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bishop emphasized that in introducing in the <gloss

                                States Government does not deviate from its position that under the
                                terms and purposes of the Basic Post Surrender Policy Japan can
                                resume participation in international relations under the guidance
                                of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, and that there is no other
                                specific <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy controlling on
                                this point. Nevertheless, we recognize that relations between
                                nations and peoples are a two-way street and it is believed that the
                                time has arrived when the governments represented on the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should give positive indication
                                that they will welcome increasing Japanese participation in
                                international relations. The time has come when we should remove all
                                barriers which stand in the way of a revival of mutually beneficial
                                exchanges. It is only by such action that the vestiges of hatred and
                                bitterness which are the inevitable <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723"

                                can decide that for certain specific purposes Jap shall resume full

                                        a naval and air base has been negligible, due mainly, it is
                                        understood, to lack of funds. In this connection air forces

                            <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Timing and Procedure</hi>. In view of the
                                differences which have developed among the interested countries
                                regarding the procedure and substance of a Japanese peace treaty and
                                in view of the serious international situation created by the Soviet
                                Union’s policy of aggressive Communist expansion, this Government
                                should not press for a treaty of peace at this time. It should
                                remain prepared to proceed with the negotiations, under some
                                generally acceptable voting procedure, if the Allied Powers can
                                agree among themselves on such a procedure. We should, before
                                actually entering into a peace conference, seek through the
                                diplomatic channel the concurrence of a majority of the
                                participating countries in the principal points of content we desire
                                to have in such a treaty. Meanwhile, we should concentrate our
                                attention on the preparation of the Japanese for the eventual
                                removal of the regime of control.</p>
                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Nature of the Treaty</hi>. It should be our
                                aim to have the treaty, when finally negotiated, as brief, as
                                general, and as nonpunitive as possible. To this end we should try
                                to clear away during this intervening period as many as possible of
                                the matters which might otherwise be expected to enter into the
                                treaty of peace. Our aim should be to reduce as far as possible the
                                number of questions to be treated in the peace treaty. This applies
                                particularly to such matters as property rights, restitution, etc.
                                Our policy for the coming period should be shaped specifically with
                                this in mind.</p>

                                as envisaged in this policy paper and with military security and

                                population. The numbers of tactical, and especially non-tactical,
                                forces should be minimized. In determining the location of
                                occupation forces, their employment, and support from the Japanese
                                economy in the pre-treaty period, full weight should be given to the
                                foregoing.</p>

                                post-treaty arrangements for Japanese military security should not
                                be formulated until the peace negotiations are upon us. It should
                                then be formulated in the light of the prevailing international
                                situation and of the degree of internal stability achieved in
                                Japan.</p>

                                at Okinawa and such other facilities as are deemed by the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff to be necessary in the Ryukyu Islands south of 29°
                                N., Marcus Island and the Nanpo Shoto south of Sofu Gran. The
                                military bases at or near Okinawa should be developed accordingly.
                                The United States agencies responsible for administering the
                                above-mentioned islands should promptly formulate and carry out a
                                program on a long-term basis for the economic and social well-being
                                and, to the extent practicable, for the eventual reduction to a
                                minimum of the deficit in the economy of the natives. At the proper
                                time, international sanction should be obtained by the means then
                                most feasible for United States long-term strategic control of the

                            <p>The United States has determined that it is now in the United States
                                national interest to alleviate the burden now borne by those of the
                                Ryukyu Islands south of latitude 29° N. incident to their
                                contribution to occupation costs, to the extent necessary to
                                establish political and economic security. While it would not be in
                                the interest of the United States to make a public announcement on
                                this matter, and while it is not believed appropriate to obtain
                                international sanction of this intent at this time, the United
                                States national policy toward the Ryukyu Islands south of latitude
                                29° N. requires that United States Armed Forces and other Government
                                agencies stationed therein pay their way to the extent necessary and
                                practical to carry out the above-mentioned program for the economic
                                and social well-being and towards eventual reduction to a minimum of
                                the deficit in the economy of the natives in this area beginning
                                sixty days after this date, and that these Islands must then no
                                longer be financially dependent upon or obligated to any other
                                occupied area.</p>
                            <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Naval Bases</hi>. The United States Navy should
                                shape its policy in the development of the Yokosuka base in such a
                                way as to favor the retention on a commercial basis in the
                                post-treaty period of as many as possible of the facilities it now
                                enjoys there. Meanwhile, it should proceed to develop the
                                possibilities of Okinawa as a naval base, on the assumption that we
                                will remain in control there on a long-term basis. This policy does
                                not preclude the retention of a naval base as such at Yokosuka if,

                                and that the purge should be modified along the following lines: (1)
                                Categories of persons who have been purged or who are subject to the
                                purge by virtue of their having held relatively harmless positions
                                should be made re-eligible for governmental, business and public
                                media positions; (2) certain others who have been barred or who are
                                subject to being barred from public life on the basis of positions
                                occupied should be allowed to have their cases re-examined solely on
                                the basis of personal actions; and (3) a minimum age limit should be
                                fixed, under which no screening for public office would be
                                required.</p>

                                should be sought through a <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0148"

                                and/or credits on a declining scale over a number of years, and by a
                                vigorous and concerted effort by all interested agencies and
                                departments of the United States Government to cut away existing
                                obstacles to the revival of Japanese foreign trade, with provision
                                for Japanese merchant shipping, and to facilitate restoration and
                                development of Japan’s exports. In developing Japan’s internal and
                                external trade and industry, private enterprise should be
                                encouraged. Recommendations concerning the implementation of the
                                above points, formulated in the light of Japan’s economic
                                relationship with other Far Eastern countries, should be worked out
                                between the State and Army Departments after consultation with the
                                other interested departments and agencies of the Government. We
                                should make it clear to the Japanese Government that the success of
                                the recovery program will in large part depend on Japanese efforts
                                to raise production and to maintain high export levels through hard
                                work, a minimum of work-stoppages, internal austerity measures and
                                the stern combatting of inflationary trends including efforts to
                                achieve a balanced internal budget as rapidly as possible.</p>

                                    in above-mentioned letter which lead US Government to make its
                                    proposal to <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> concerning
                                    conduct of Japan’s foreign relations.</p>
                                <p>Proposal of 21 April mentions that “one of the fundamental
                                    objectives of the occupation is to facilitate progressive

                                <p>French Government wishes point out in this connection that
                                    fundamental text of Japan occupation policy, i.e. <gloss
                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> basic decision of 20 [<hi

                                    “progressive resumption of international responsibilities” of
                                    Tokyo government but only the creation as soon as possible “of a
                                    democratic and peaceful government which will carry on its
                                    international relations”.</p>
                                <p>Therefore the decision of the 20 June 1947 did not contemplate
                                    that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> should be progressively
                                    shorn in matter of control of Japan’s international relations of
                                    powers which it enjoys by virtue of Moscow agreement of 27
                                    December 1945.</p>
                                <p>Proposal of 21 April 1949 in its present form nevertheless
                                    results in delegating discretionary powers to <gloss

                                <p>I add that these discretionary powers cannot be delegated to
                                        <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> since neither the

                                    them.</p>
                                <p>French Government is nonetheless in agreement with US Government
                                    in believing that there are questions of an international nature
                                    which it would be advantageous for Japanese Government to handle
                                    by itself under <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s control:

                            <p>In my last interview with General MacArthur prior to leaving Tokyo,
                                among other subjects discussed was the possibility of General

                                reasons. In response to my question on this subject, he said that I

                                a progressive relaxation of the controls exercised by the Occupation

                                Major General Edward M. Almond, called a meeting of all chiefs of
                                Headquarters’ staff sections, as well as his two deputies (<gloss

                                    (<gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> instructions), verbal

                                to determining those which might be eliminated or modified. Reports
                                are to be submitted by May 23 to the Deputy Chief of Staff (<gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>), who will prepare a consolidated

                                be placed in three categories, i.e., (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                those which must be continued, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) those
                                which may be modified, and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) those which
                                may be withdrawn, justification to be provided for all directives
                                which the section chiefs feel must be continued in present or
                                modified form.</p>
                            <p>Making it clear that he was taking this action at the express
                                direction of the Supreme Commander, General Almond stated that the
                                general program of relaxing controls to which Headquarters had been
                                devoted for some time might now be considered as having passed from
                                an “implied” to an “expressed” stage. He noted that the
                                determination to relax Occupation controls had been clearly
                                expressed in General MacArthur’s message on the second anniversary
                                of the Japanese Constitution on May 3, which, after attributing the
                                long duration of the Occupation to “events and circumstances
                                elsewhere beyond your capacity to influence or control”, indicated
                                the Supreme Commander’s purpose to reduce restrictions on Japan’s
                                autonomy in the following words:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In these two years the character of the Occupation has gradually
                                    changed from the stern rigidity of a military operation to the
                                    friendly guidance of a protective force. While insisting upon
                                    the firm adherence to the course delineated by existing Allied
                                    policy and directive, it is my purpose to continue to advance
                                    this transition just as rapidly as you are able to assume the
                                    attending autonomous responsibility. Thus progressive latitude
                                    will come to you in the stewardship of your own affairs.”</p>

                            <p>Stressing the characterization of the present period of the
                                Occupation as one of “economic rehabilitation”, General Almond
                                declared that the time had come when it was imperative to take
                                practical and effective measures to accord the degree of control
                                exercised by Occupation authorities with the fact that the
                                Occupation had passed from the “stern rigidity of a military
                                operation to the friendly guidance of a protective force”. Prepared
                                forms were then distributed, and the Acting Deputy Chief of Staff

                            <p>A general air of willing cooperation prevailed among the section
                                chiefs, although Major General William F. Marquat, Chief of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ESS1">ESS</gloss> (Economic and Scientific Section),
                                on which a major burden will fall in the preparation of these
                                reports, rose to point out the particular difficulties with which he
                                would be faced in undertaking this tremendous task and at the same
                                time carrying on his other work under the multitudinous directives
                                calling upon him to implement the present intensive program of
                                economic rehabilitation. Brigadier General Courtney Whitney, Chief
                                of Government Section, remarked that his section had “issued no
                                directives during the past two years”.</p>
                            <p>Some 17,000 <gloss target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss>s and other
                                directives have been issued to the Japanese Government during the
                                period of the Occupation. A large number of these, of course, are
                                now obsolete or inoperative, many of them having been “one-time
                                    <gloss target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss>s” dealing with a
                                single case or operation. It is accordingly obvious that the present
                                program will be able to show impressive results as a matter of
                                adjusted records with respect to the number of <gloss
                                    target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss>s and other directives now in
                                effect, as a great majority of them can simply be struck out as
                                presently inoperative. This will not mean, however, that such
                                clearance of the records can be taken as representing any real
                                relaxation of controls now in existence. The test will come when the
                                various section chiefs determine which of the presently operative
                                controls for which they are responsible can be relinquished and
                                which must be continued, and the effectiveness of the program will
                                be finally determined by the action taken by the Chief of Staff and,
                                ultimately, the Supreme Commander on the various justifications
                                submitted.</p>
                            <p>This Mission has been responsible for the issuance of very few <gloss
                                    target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss>s, and these have in virtually
                                every instance been of a permissive or informative, rather than a
                                controlling character; they include, for example, authorization for
                                Japan to participate in certain international conferences,
                                permission for Japanese to file claims in the United States for the
                                release and return of vested property, authorization for the
                                Japanese authorities to correspond with Japanese nationals abroad,
                                and similar directives of a character which places no limitations on
                                Japan’s autonomy.</p>
                            <p>This meeting, which, whether eventually productive of the desired
                                results or not, seems to reflect an honest recognition in General
                                Headquarters of the need for a genuine relaxation of controls and
                                the progressive transfer of responsibilities to the Japanese
                                Government, coincided in point of time with the week-end appearance

                                    <p>Today marks the second anniversary of the birth of New
                                        Japan—a Japan conceived in the impoverished aftermath of
                                        war’s violence, seeking political stability and social
                                        progress through concepts which hold to the primacy of
                                        individual liberty, equal opportunity, and personal
                                        dignity.</p>
                                    <p>These have been fruitful years as you progressively have come
                                        to understand and live by the new and enlightened
                                        constitutional precepts. Your basic laws have been recast
                                        and your public institutions redesigned. Your selected
                                        architects and builders have worked arduously to fabricate a
                                        citadel of freedom from those imperishable human norms drawn
                                        from experience of the ages. And your house now rests upon a
                                        political and social foundation which, if well fortified by
                                        the human spirit, should remain impervious to the
                                        ideological stresses and strains which threaten all about
                                        you.</p>
                                    <p>Your farmers now own the soil they and their forebears long
                                        have tilled—your workers now have voice in the conditions of
                                        their employment—and your women now exercise influence upon
                                        the political and social course of Japan’s destiny, all
                                        beneficiaries of human rights and fundamental liberties
                                        rendered inalienable by your constitutional mandates. These
                                        changes in the moral values of Japanese life have brought
                                        about a regeneration of the Japanese edifice. This edifice,
                                        if it firmly stands as an impregnable barrier against the
                                        forces bent upon its destruction, will strengthen the faith
                                        of all peoples in the spirituality of human freedom. And in
                                        proportion as you value this freedom you must understand,
                                        cherish and preserve it.</p>
                                    <p>The Allied purposes enunciated at Potsdam in many essential
                                        respects have been fulfilled, and you have worked diligently
                                        and faithfully to discharge your surrender commitments. That
                                        Allied forces still occupy your native soil is thus by no
                                        means due to fault of yours since the inception of the
                                        Occupation, but rather to events and circumstances elsewhere
                                        beyond your capacity to influence or control.</p>
                                    <p>In these two years the character of the Occupation has
                                        gradually changed from the stern rigidity of a military
                                        operation to the friendly guidance of a protective force.
                                        While insisting upon the firm adherence <pb n="744"
                                            xml:id="pg_744" facs="0158"/>to the course delineated by
                                        existing Allied policy and directive, it is my purpose to
                                        continue to advance this transition just as rapidly as you
                                        are able to assume the attending autonomous responsibility.
                                        Thus progressive latitude will come to you in the
                                        stewardship of your own affairs.</p>
                                    <p>To such end and to insure the continuity of a calm and well
                                        ordered progress, I call upon every Japanese citizen on this
                                        anniversary of Japan’s rebirth, to safeguard the commonweal
                                        by unrelaxed vigilance against the destructive inroads of
                                        concepts incredulous of human wisdom, prejudicial to
                                        personal dignity, and suppressive of individual liberty.
                                        There can be no higher human purpose.</p>

                                    xml:id="d77fn3">Not printed.</note> addressed to me on May 11,
                                1949, by Dr. John W. Burton, Secretary (and in the absence of Dr.
                                Evatt acting head) of the Department of External Affairs, in reply
                                to a note I sent him on the basis of the Department’s circular
                                telegram of April 22. It will be noted that the essence of Dr.
                                Burton’s note is that the Australian Government “considers that
                                adequate provision already exists under existing policy decisions of
                                the Far Eastern Commission for such limited participation by Japan
                                in international affairs as is necessary at the present time”.</p>
                            <p>I regret that in this and other recent matters relating to Japan the
                                Embassy has been unsuccessful in its efforts to persuade the
                                Australian Government to accept the United States viewpoint and
                                policies. I have in mind the Department’s circular telegrams of

                                industry. I know the Department appreciates, however, that the
                                problem of Japan’s status and international position is a peculiarly
                                difficult one here. From the point of view of the Australian people
                                generally and the Australian Labor Government in particular it is
                                only a few years since Japan was their mortal enemy bent upon
                                invading their continent.</p>
                            <p>It is perhaps understandable that they still feel a lingering hatred
                                and fear of the Japanese together with an instinctive opposition to
                                any measure which might tend to restore Japan’s prewar military,
                                political, industrial, or commercial power. They feel that a
                                self-supporting Japan of 80,000,000 people even though no threat to
                                the United States would inevitably constitute a menace to the
                                security and economy of Australia’s 8,000,000 people. Many
                                Australians will admit the logic of the United States thesis that
                                from the American point of view the Japanese economy must be
                                reconstructed at least to the level where the country can support
                                itself and can resist the inroads of communism. But Australian
                                emotions nonetheless continue to override the logic of the
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>There are of course other factors which complicate the situation. The
                                Australian Labor Government is, as the Department well knows,
                                extremely jealous of the independent position of Australia,
                                suspicious <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0160"/>of what it
                                regards as American economic imperialism, and determined not to be
                                pushed around.</p>
                            <p>Couple all these things with the fact that Dr. Herbert V. Evatt,
                                Minister for External Affairs, who makes the country’s immediate
                                foreign policy almost single-handed, follows a highly academic
                                approach to international problems, and there exists ample basis for
                                an almost automatic opposition to United States proposals and
                                policies in connection with the future of Japan.</p>
                            <p>More specifically—and these are perhaps symptoms rather than causes
                                of the Australian attitude—the Australians insist upon the primary
                                position of the Far Eastern Commission as against the Supreme
                                Commander of the Allied Powers. They insist also in urging the
                                conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty ahead of other
                                considerations. They are fearful of Japanese commercial competition
                                especially in so far as this might hurt the foreign trade of the
                                United Kingdom. Again, this is an election year, and a bitter
                                campaign is already under way for the Commonwealth Parliamentary
                                elections scheduled for December; this naturally does not predispose
                                either the Government or the electorate toward a dispassionate view
                                of international problems.</p>
                            <p>Behind all these considerations lies the fact that generally speaking
                                the Australian people and their Labor Government continue to share
                                the complacent assumption that when the next war comes, if it does,
                                the United States will bail them out just as it did last time.
                                Nevertheless, this complacency has been somewhat shaken by the
                                withdrawal of United States defenses to the west coast of North
                                America, the collapse of China, and the deteriorating situation in
                                southeastern Asia, and there is evidence of a dawning realization of
                                the dangers of Australia’s isolated position. This, however, has the
                                effect not of converting the Australians to our policies with
                                respect to Japan but of causing them to feel that until the present
                                situation is clarified no irrevocable steps should be taken which
                                might even partially restore Japanese power.</p>

                                Minister’s earnest appeal for world sympathy, confidence, and
                                cooperation in assisting Japan’s economic recovery and return to
                                normal international relations.</p>
                            <p>The Prime Minister also took occasion to correct what he considers a
                                false impression of himself and the Democratic Liberal Party. He
                                noted that he and his party are often described in foreign books,
                                magazines, and newspapers as “ultra-conservatives,” “reactionaries,”
                                and “die-hards”. Mr. Yoshida stated that he and some of his
                                associates were arrested by the Military Police during the war
                                because they did not subscribe to the creeds and doctrines of the
                                militarists and ultra-nationalists then in power. The Prime Minister
                                emphasized that during the war it was the militarists who were the
                                radicals and that he and his associates were the conservatives who
                                stood for peace and dared to defy those in power.</p>
                            <p>There is no doubt that Mr. Yoshida keenly resents the labels
                                “reactionary” and “die-hard” which many foreign correspondents as
                                well as leftist opponents in Japan repeatedly use in describing him
                                and the Democratic Liberal Party. While some of the leaders of the
                                Democratic Liberal Party unquestionably represent an old-guard type
                                of conservatism, it is inaccurate to describe the Prime Minister and
                                the party he heads as reactionary in the customary sense of the
                                word. Mr. Yoshida and his party represent the principal conservative
                                element in postwar Japan primarily because there is nothing further
                                to the right as an influential organized party. As the Prime
                                Minister noted in his address, the only difference between his
                                position during the war and today is that he and his party are now
                                in power.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Yoshida’s position is actually a relative one. Since the end of
                                the war the scale for measuring political viewpoints has been
                                shifted far to the left. During the war this scale began on the far
                                right with the militarism and extreme nationalism as personified by
                                the Tojo coterie, and extended only about as far to the left as Mr.
                                Yoshida and other peace advocates who were harrassed or imprisoned
                                for their “radical” views. With the end of the war, almost
                                everything from Tojo extremism to the edge of Mr. Yoshida’s
                                conservative position was swept from Japanese political life, while,
                                at the same time, the political scale was shifted to include
                                newly-risen political groups ranging from the liberalism of the
                                Social Democratic Party to communism. This shifting of the scale
                                has, of course, left Mr. Yoshida at what has now become the right in
                                Japanese politics.</p>
                            <p>In his appeal for sympathy and understanding, Mr. Yoshida expressed
                                the hope that the world will realize that the Japanese are today
                                sincerely endeavoring to rebuild their nation upon a peaceful,
                                democratic basis. He pleaded for a tempering of thoughts of revenge
                                and retribution by those who suffered from Japanese aggression with
                                the <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0162"/>realization that Japan
                                now stands before the world chastened, humbled, and helpless as a
                                result of a disastrous military defeat. The Prime Minister expressed
                                the hope that the world will not hold the transgressions of the past
                                against Japan’s future and will permit Japan to resume its place
                                among the nations. “All we are asking now,” the Prime Minister
                                pleaded, “is access to materials and markets so that we may buy the
                                food we need to live.”</p>
                            <p>The Prime Minister’s appeal for sympathy and understanding of the
                                problems which face Japan’s recovery and his denial of having
                                reactionary policies have been favorably received by the Japanese
                                press as a highly desirable effort to dispel suspicion and
                                misunderstanding over Japan’s efforts to recover. Some Japanese,
                                however, have expressed disappointment that Mr. Yoshida did not deal
                                with the communist problem and reiterate his determination to stamp
                                out communism. In making his appeal for the world’s sympathy and in
                                attempting to counter charges of being reactionary, Mr. Yoshida
                                probably believed it would be inappropriate to deal with the
                                communists beyond his concluding statement that he and his party do
                                not see eye to eye with the Socialists and “abhor communism”.</p>

                            <p>There was no opportunity discuss contents with President May 12. When
                                I saw him this morning he said he was about go into meeting with
                                Cabinet discuss problem. However, he said that those reparations
                                already approved for Philippines prior this US policy decision
                                should certainly be delivered. As long as there is blood in the
                                Japanese turnip, he added, Japan should be forced turn over
                                materials in partial restitution to those countries which it
                                ravished, among which Philippines an outstanding example.</p>
                            <p>President said he appreciated US generosity and humanitarian attitude
                                toward underprivileged suffering people but felt US more concerned
                                alleviate aftermath war Japan than in Philippines which suffered so
                                terrifically at hands Japan. He indicated that but for our undue
                                concern Japan’s welfare we might automatically save American
                                taxpayer nine hundred millions we now spend there annually.</p>
                            <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0163"/>
                            <p>I pointed out that our military withdrawal and cessation economic aid
                                Japan would probably result its being taken over by Soviets or their
                                agents which would place Philippines under immediate danger
                                Communist domination. If President was influenced by this argument
                                he did not show it.</p>

                                permit exaction of just reparations in kind in Jap and still hoped

                            <p>US policies and actions in Japan are on behalf of and in interest of
                                all Far Eastern nations. Programs of democratization and reform in

                                only if tolerable econ conditions <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751"

                                to provide approximately half billion dollars of econ aid to Japan
                                annually from its own resources but has been willing to do so to
                                make possible success of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                programs which can alone produce peaceful Japan.</p>
                            <p>At same time US cannot indefinitely bear burden of Japan’s support.
                                It must assist the re-attainment by Japan of self-supporting economy
                                at earliest possible time. Further reparations from deficit Jap
                                economy wld obviously be inconsistent with this objective. Japan has
                                been completely disarmed and US is determined that its capacity to
                                make war shall not be permitted to re-emerge.</p>

                            <p>The occupation of Japan will soon enter its fifth year. Although the
                                occupation has in many respects been an outstanding success, it
                                began to approach the point of diminishing returns almost two years
                                ago, not long after our proposal of July, 1947, for a peace
                                conference. Although there has as yet been no active resistance to
                                the occupation, and little passive resistance directed specifically
                                against the occupation itself, the Japanese people, who in our own
                                estimation were ready for a peace treaty two years ago, have become
                                increasingly restive under conditions of indefinitely continued
                                military occupation, and desire for a peace settlement is
                                widespread. Partly as a result of these feelings, the Japan
                                Communist Party increased its representation in the Diet from 4 to
                                35 in the general elections last January. Although the Communists
                                still constitute a small proportion of the total population the
                                Communist threat in Japan is a real one.</p>
                            <p>Coincident with, and a partial cause of, the gradual souring of
                                popular attitudes toward the occupation in Japan has been the
                                disappointingly slow revival of Japanese production and trade.
                                Production is still only 65 per cent of the 1930–34 levels, when the
                                population was some 15 million smaller. Annual U.S. aid requirements
                                for Japan have increased rather than diminished, and the production
                                increases which have been achieved in Japan have been based almost
                                entirely on this aid and deficit financing by the Japanese
                                Government. It was accordingly necessary for the U.S. Government in
                                December, 1948, to direct the institution of a comprehensive
                                stabilization program to place the Japanese domestic economy on a
                                sound basis. Although substantial progress has been made in
                                implementating this program it will be some time before its
                                objectives can be achieved, and even longer, optimistically 1954 or
                                1955, before Japan can hope to regain a self-supporting status. The
                                United States on May 12 announced its opposition to the removal of
                                any further reparations from Japan in order that the Japanese might
                                devote their full energies and resources to the stabilization
                                objective.</p>
                            <p>In March, 1948, Mr. Kennan made a trip to Japan and on his return
                                submitted recommendations for the progressive adjustment of
                                occupation policies to permit continuation of the occupation pending
                                a peace treaty without jeopardizing the gains achieved up to that
                                    time.<note n="1" xml:id="d82fn1">March 25, 1948, <ref

                                    >SCAP</gloss> should shift responsibility as rapidly as possible
                                to the Japanese, with a corresponding reduction in <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> personnel, that the Japanese
                                should be permitted to proceed in their own way with the
                                assimilation of the reform programs, and that the psychological
                                impact of the occupation on the Japanese should be reduced to a
                                minimum. Unfortunately these recommendations have been only
                                partially carried out. The developing situations in Japan and in the
                                Far East, and the necessity for both political and economic reasons
                                for putting the Japanese on their own responsibility, have caused
                                the Department to give renewed consideration to the conclusion of a
                                peace settlement. A letter has been prepared from Secretary Acheson
                                to Secretary Johnson requesting information regarding implementation
                                of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3, and a memorandum has
                                been sent to Admiral Souers of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                            <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0169"/>
                            <p>Unanimous Japanese reaction one of elation. Japanese word most
                                commonly used was “arigatai,” meaning welcome. US statement not
                                unexpected by informed Japanese quarters, but all were surprised by
                                sweeping nature of US position, especially decision that primary war
                                facilities should be converted to peaceful use where possible. All
                                quarters Japan attributed decision to US generosity and to US desire
                                to revive Japanese economy, and emphasized improved morale of people
                                and likelihood of higher standard of living.</p>
                            <p>Japanese Government reaction entirely favorable without regard to
                                politics. Diet members emphasized both US desire to help Japan and
                                saving of well over 2 billion yen from Japanese budget. Opinion also
                                expressed in Diet that peace treaty will be facilitated since
                                Japan’s major wartime obligation apparently removed. Private opinion
                                also expressed that this US move effectively counteracts recent
                                gains Communist influence resulting from China successes. No
                                official Communist Party reaction; Communists want budget saving
                                effected to be used for education, and one prominent Communist
                                claims that US move means reparations from production, which he says
                                Communist Party has always advocated. Japanese Finance Ministry has
                                cautioned that US move does not necessarily mean that no further
                                reparations will be taken from Japan, but Foreign Office has
                                indicated publicly that US position will effectively preclude
                                further reparations after interim program finished.</p>
                            <p>Japanese press gave US statement widest publicity, extras on day of
                                announcement and headlines for two days. Technical aspects regarding
                                revision of directives, primary war industries, et cetera, caused
                                some confusion but press and public quickly realized that US was
                                stopping present reparations program and advocating maximum use
                                industrial capacity Japan for peace-time industry. Japanese press
                                and public only vaguely aware of mechanics of <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> but are clearly conscious of US
                                contribution to Japan’s economic recovery; connection with nine
                                economic principles and Dodge Mission noted. Stock market,
                                especially heavy industry, jumped immediately after US announcement.
                                Later reactions concerned statistics of repatriations [<hi
                                    rend="italic">reparations</hi>] already delivered, budgetary
                                saving and use of this money, and effect on deconcentration program
                                of stopping of reparations.</p>
                            <p>Local allied representatives accepted US decision without protest,
                                except Chinese and Filipinos who have made vigorous informal
                                protests. All local allied representatives appear to have realized
                                probability of some such US move and most do not question its
                                necessity. Chief concern of local representatives now is whether or
                                not equipment now allocated but not delivered to four advance
                                transfer countries will be cut off.</p>

                                Japanese hope for an early peace treaty is deep and the reaction to
                                the prospect of discussion by CFM is therefore enthusiastic,
                                Japanese practical expectations arising from the proposal have been
                                soberly tempered by doubt as to Soviet motives and the apparent
                                necessity of Chinese participation. Some opinion believes proposal
                                motivated by Communist success in China and Soviet intention to
                                force United States recognition of Communist Government since no
                                treaty settlement with Japan can be made without Chinese
                                participation. Japanese Communists have repeatedly advocated early
                                peace treaty since summer 1948 concomitant with withdrawal
                                occupation.</p>

                                not understand why the United States in replying to Vishinsky did
                                not set forth more fully and emphatically United States desire for
                                Japan peace treaty and point out that previous American efforts
                                failed largely because of Soviet attitude. In general, Japanese
                                elated at prospect of peace treaty discussions at high level but

                            <p>There is some thought here that useful ammunition for counteracting
                                Communist propaganda might have been provided by admitting the

                                took with you. I hope to clear today with the National Military
                                Establishment and White House a telegram recommending that you
                                maintain our present position that the Soviet proposal for
                                consideration of a Japanese peace treaty not be discussed in the
                                Council of Foreign Ministers but that renewed explorations of the
                                subject might be carried on through diplomatic channels.
                                Incidentally, this recommendation would be made in the full
                                realization that it would probably give the Soviets some propaganda

                            <p>It may well be that our minimum security needs with regard to Japan
                                will be found to be of such a nature that, in combination with the
                                necessity from the viewpoint of our economic well-being of getting
                                Japan on a self-supporting basis, it will prove impossible to attain
                                general international agreement to a treaty which would secure
                                United States objectives. Only after receiving replies to the
                                enclosed communications to the Secretary of Defense and the National
                                Security Council and after diplomatic talks with friendly powers
                                associated with us in other parts of the world will it be possible
                                to reach a decision on these matters.</p>
                            <p>Should it become apparent that attempts to reach a multilateral
                                settlement which safeguards vital United States security and
                                economic interests will be unsuccessful, it would be most
                                unfortunate if we were committed to proceed with negotiations for a
                                treaty. Not being so committed it would be possible to proceed with
                                a vigorous implementation of the present or if necessary a revised
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3. Such action should
                                include the possibility of dynamic changes in the regime of control
                                in Japan looking toward the creation of conditions approximating
                                those which would prevail under a peace treaty so that at some point
                                it would be possible to obtain general international <hi

                                this process to consider how the United States can disengage itself
                                from the present international mechanism, involving <gloss

                                temporary expedient and not in the expectation that the United
                                States <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0174"/>would indefinitely
                                continue to appropriate, aside from cost of the military occupation,
                                some $400,000,000 a year for Japanese support), but which has now
                                lost its <hi rend="italic">raison d’être</hi>, at least so far as
                                the interests of the United States are concerned and has in many
                                respects become a straightjacket. The legal complications are, of
                                course, sundry and require careful attention.</p>
                            <p>In view of all the above considerations we believe we should take no
                                steps at this time which would start us down a road the end of which
                                we cannot yet see and from which we could only turn back at the cost
                                of grave embarrassment. We, therefore, believe our course of action
                                should be to proceed rapidly with the determination of our own
                                minimum desiderata in full consultation with the National Military
                                Establishment followed by a study of the most feasible means of
                                achieving them in the light of present world conditions. With the
                                despatch of the enclosed communications a first step has been made.
                                The officers concerned are giving urgent consideration to such other
                                aspects of the question as can be studied prior to a reply to these
                                communications. It is hoped that upon your return from Paris or
                                shortly thereafter it will be possible to proceed to more definitive
                                action.</p>

                            <p>Re request for US interpretation of para 2 b, US member pointed out
                                that under existing circumstances US agrees to broad general
                                principle that each member nation of <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> may define on reasonable basis area in high seas
                                within which it has direct concern, for security reasons or for
                                enforcement of legitimate conservation measures, with respect to
                                entry into that area of Jap vessels for fishing or other commercial
                                aquatic activities. US acceptance of this broad general principle
                                is, however, on assumption that it will be applied within rule of
                                reason, and that no state will claim a direct concern over area
                                which wld not be generally accepted as reasonable. If such case shld
                                arise wherein nation insists on direct concern over area which has
                                no possible relationship to national security or to legitimate
                                conservation measures, and if <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                cld not through negotiation secure a modification of position taken
                                by member nation, he wld be forced to exercise discretion implied in
                                para 2 b, with reference to extension of Jap fishing into such part
                                of area claimed as cld have no reasonable relation to <pb n="761"

                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> member country continues to
                                regard as its own direct concern, it is recognized that each country
                                may request <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> to review action of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> or resort to diplomatic

                                countries for general consideration of question.</p>
                            <p>Chi member suggested that US interpretation be drafted in form of

                                inquired as to meaning of expression “legitimate conservation
                                measures” which occurs in US statement. Chi member attempted to

                                said there was no issue of “unrestricted right to strike”, but only
                                of a “right to strike” by workers in Govt enterprises. He also said
                                all “essential services” were not Govt enterprises. He explained
                                that in Austral there is “system of compulsory arbitration” but this
                                system and right to strike do not mutually exclude each other.</p>

                            <p>The Acting Secretary of State refers to the Mission’s No. 247 of
                                April 21, 1949<note n="1" xml:id="d89fn1">Not printed.</note>
                                requesting the full text of the statement, attributed in a United
                                Press report to the Special Assistant for Press Relations, on the
                                subject of the final disposition of Formosa and the Kurile Islands.
                                There is enclosed an extract<note n="1" xml:id="d89fn2">Not
                                    printed.</note> from the verbatim transcript of the Special
                                Assistant’s press conference at which this subject was briefly
                                discussed.</p>
                            <p>The Special Assistant’s remarks do not indicate a further development
                                in the Department’s policy on this problem. The Department remains
                                of the opinion that there can be no final determination of Japan’s
                                territorial sovereignty in the absence of a peace settlement and
                                that there are meanwhile good reasons for avoiding any expression,
                                implied or direct, of United States views on this subject.</p>
                            <p>For the Mission’s confidential guidance, however, it may be pointed
                                out that the United States Government will give careful study to the
                                question of supporting any Japanese claims at the peace settlement
                                to the Habomai Group, Shikotan, Kunashiri and Etorofu. The
                                Department supports the intention of the Mission to avoid, in the
                                course of Headquarters exchanges with the Office of the Soviet
                                member for the Allied Council, any action which would tend to weaken
                                Japanese claims to the islands in question.</p>

                            <p>Austral member stated his Govt wld not support US proposal. It felt
                                under existing <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policies there is
                                already ample latitude for fostering Japan’s contacts with other

                                conferences as long as technical state of war exists with Japan. It

                                but until such settlement concluded <gloss target="#t_FEC1"

                            <p>The Philippine Mission, in its note of May 24, 1949, expressed
                                general objection to a strict construction of the directive halting
                                interim reparations transfers from Japan, on the triple grounds that
                                reparations thus far received by the Philippines were inadequate in
                                view of the war damage suffered by that country, that immediate
                                halting of interim transfers would seriously interfere with
                                Philippine industrialization plans based on reparations material,
                                and that the benefit to Japan of immediate cessation of transfers
                                would not compensate for the resentment aroused in the Philippines

                                Philippines and Japan. This Mission, in its capacity as the
                                Diplomatic Section of <gloss target="#t_GHQ1">GHQ</gloss>, <gloss

                                Philippine request to the Office of the Civil Property Custodian,
                                the section of headquarters having jurisdiction over reparations
                                matters.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese Mission, in a note of May 25, 1949, briefly expressed its
                                general objection to the halting of Japanese reparations transfers,
                                and, after stating that final action on Japanese reparations must be
                                determined by the Far Eastern Commission “and the Allied Nations
                                concerned”, took up specific points in the <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> implementation of the directive halting interim
                                transfers. On the basis of a version of the United States directive
                                allegedly received from the Chinese delegation to the Far Eastern
                                Commission, the Mission protested <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> action to halt the transfer of “items already
                                processed” under Directive no. 75. Particular stress was placed on
                                the Chinese desire to complete the transfer of electrical facilities
                                from ten former Japanese arsenals, and of a 200-ton crane and 15,000
                                KVA power plant at Kure, which the Mission describes as urgently
                                needed in Formosa.</p>
                            <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0179"/>
                            <p>The Chief of the Chinese Mission also addressed a letter to the Chief
                                of Staff (<gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>) on May 20, 1949,
                                making similar representations concerning the Kure facilities. This
                                communication was forwarded by the Chief of Staff to this Mission,
                                in its capacity as the Diplomatic Section of <gloss target="#t_GHQ1"
                                    >GHQ</gloss>, with the request that a reply be made to the
                                Chinese Mission substantially as follows:</p>

                                1949.</p>
                            <p>This Mission has sent an interim reply to the Chinese Mission’s note
                                of May 25, 1949, informing the Mission that the matter is under
                                consideration in <gloss target="#t_GHQ1">GHQ</gloss>, <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. It is informally understood that
                                headquarters proposes to take no positive action on the Chinese
                                Mission’s requests concerning transfer of the facilities at Kure or
                                other reparations items in the immediate future.</p>
                            <p>Although I have had several conversations during the past ten days
                                with both General Chu, Head of the Chinese Mission, and Mr. Shen,
                                his Minister-Counselor, neither of them has broached the subject of
                                reparations. The Head of the Philippine Mission, Dr. Africa, has
                                spoken to me on the subject somewhat casually, indicating resigned
                                acceptance of the new situation by saying that he supposed the
                                Philippine Reparations and Restitution Delegation in Tokyo might now
                                be leaving for Manila and thus free some housing space for other
                                Mission personnel. He added that the American announcement had
                                stirred up popular sentiments in the Philippines to such an extent
                                that he felt it was not unlikely that the Philippine people will now
                                refuse to trade with Japan.</p>

                            <p>Despite repeated attempts by the United States Government to have
                                this resolution defeated or tabled, the Resolution was passed by the
                                Steering Committee on May 31 by a vote of 6 to 1, the United States
                                alone opposing and the USSR, China, Netherlands and Philippines
                                abstaining. It is now before the Commission and will probably be
                                voted upon within the next few weeks.</p>
                            <p>The United States is therefore confronted with an immediate choice
                                between three courses of action: (1) not voting against the
                                resolution (which would permit its adoption), (2) voting against the
                                resolution (which would in effect mean use of the veto), or (3)
                                further seeking the withdrawal or tabling of the resolution.</p>
                            <p>The first course of action is highly inadvisable. The controlling
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> directive (<gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–045/5), to which this resolution
                                refers, is a broad statement of principles for Japanese trade
                                unions, which does not state to which specific groups it does or
                                does not apply. <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> acted within
                                his proper administrative discretion in interpreting the directive
                                as he saw fit, and his interpretation of the directive has been
                                translated by the Japanese Government into a series of laws known as
                                the National Public Service Legislation. The effect of the
                                Australian resolution, if adopted, would be to require a major
                                rewriting of these laws, which in turn would undermine the position
                                of the present government, unquestionably produce political turmoil
                                in Japan and jeopardize the stabilization program. Furthermore, the
                                passage of the Australian resolution, being a reversal of the
                                position publicly taken by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>,
                                would result in a serious loss of his prestige.</p>
                            <p>The second course of action, while definitely preferable to the
                                first, has the disadvantages of (1) requiring that the United States
                                use the veto to defeat a resolution which no other <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries oppose, (2) affording the
                                USSR an opportunity publicly to present the United States as being
                                alone opposed to the “rights” of Japanese labor, (3) not settling
                                the overall controversy in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                concerning the rights of Japanese Government workers.</p>
                            <p>The third course of action is therefore preferable if at all
                                possible. However, several attempts have already been made by
                                officers of the Department to secure withdrawal of the Austrialian
                                proposal, but all have proved unsuccessful. The Austrialian
                                Delegation is acting under firm orders from the Australian Labor
                                Government and it has the active support of all the other
                                Commonwealth countries. Clearly, the Australian Government will not
                                accede to any request that it table its resolution unless the United
                                States has a definite counter-proposal. This has been intimated to
                                us on a number of occasions.</p>
                            <p>What Australia and the other countries have repeatedly sought from us
                                is an expression of what, in our opinion, should be the principles
                                governing Japanese Government workers. So far we have taken the
                                position that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–045/5 is a broad
                                statement of principles for <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0183"
                                />Japanese trade unions which does not indicate the specific
                                categories to which it applies or does not apply. This position is
                                obviously unresponsive to the question raised by the other countries
                                as well as by important segments of opinion in this country, and has
                                rendered more imperative the need for the United States to take more
                                than a negative, evasive stand on this question.</p>
                            <p>For this reason, State–Army–Labor wired <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"

                                including the right of mediation and arbitration but not of strike,
                                should be extended to all non-executive full-time employees of
                                Japanese Government enterprises. We told <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> that if the United States Government were in a

                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries that the United
                                States and <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> supported this
                                principle and that full effect would be given to it by <gloss

                                to say here that <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> does not find in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s arguments sufficient
                                substance to be dissuaded from the wisdom of the proposal which
                                State–Army–Labor put to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> last
                                April. This proposal, which we continue to support, would merely
                                require that the Telecommunications Ministry become the National
                                Telecommunications Corporation. Its 143,000 workers would continue
                                to be denied the right to strike. They would continue to be subject
                                to strong punitive measures. They would, however, acquire the right
                                of having their grievances adjudicated by an arbitration court
                                (Labor–Management–Government) rather than continuing to have them
                                decided by the National Personnel Authority. We see no security risk
                                involved in such an undertaking.</p>
                            <p>It must also be emphasized that our proposal is not advanced in a
                                spirit of appeasement to the views of other countries and interested
                                groups. From a substantive point of view we believe that it would be
                                consonant with and confirm the otherwise logical distinction made in
                                the National Public Service legislation between public enterprise
                                    <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0184"/>workers and regular
                                civil servants. Failure to extend mediation and arbitration
                                facilities to the telecommunications workers is an apparent
                                discrimination against a particular group of workers that may do
                                more to promote than to curb Communist influence among them. The
                                proposal, if carried out, would also serve to combat Communist
                                influence in the Japanese trade union movement by showing <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s genuine concern for the rights
                                of Government workers, particularly at a time when the Government
                                workers are suffering, perhaps more than any other group, the brunt
                                of the stabilization program.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_E1">FE</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>
                                therefore continue to be of the firm opinion that <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> should be induced, provided the
                                internal security problem can be met, to agree to carry out the
                                principle stated above. <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s
                                contrary view—which has now been supported by the Department of the
                                Army—leads me to the conclusion that if the course of action we
                                recommend is to be carried out, there must be established a
                                high-level United States Government position on this matter which is
                                then brought fully to bear upon <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>. In so doing <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                should be warned that a United States veto of the Australian
                                resolution might well lead to an <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                resolution along the lines of the principle to which we subscribe;
                                that if this were to happen, the United States would be placed in
                                the deplorable position where it could not afford to oppose an
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> directive compelling <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to do what we believe he should
                                do on his own initiative.</p>
                            <p>In order to obtain Army agreement in this matter, a personal
                                high-level approach to Mr. Johnson is suggested, since lower
                                echelons of the Army now appear adamant in their support of <gloss

                            <p>The following release was given out by the <gloss target="#t_GHQ1"
                                    >GHQ</gloss> spokesman today:</p>
                            <p>Nothing is known here of discussions for the transfer from the
                                Department of the Army to the Department of State of the primary
                                control of United States Interests in the Occupation of Japan. It is
                                believed that the discussions do not involve change in the present
                                regime of local control in Japan, as such change, unlike the
                                situation existing in the American Zone of Germany where the United
                                States has from the start exercised unilateral control, could only
                                be accomplished through agreement by the eleven nations of the Far
                                Eastern Commission as provided by the international commitments of
                                the United States and the other nations concerned. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> set-up is international in
                                character, the occupation including the British Commonwealth
                                Occupation Forces as well as United States Forces, and other
                                international bodies, and overall policies are primarily fixed by
                                the Far Eastern Commission, a civilian group from the eleven
                                nations, sitting in Washington. The United States could not
                                unilaterally alter this international set-up and it is not believed
                                here that any attempt to do so is contemplated. Apparently what is
                                being discussed is whether American interests will be primarily
                                handled by the State Department in Washington or, as heretofore, by
                                the Department of the Army in Washington, an internal question which
                                rests solely with the United States Government. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> set-up in Japan itself would not
                                necessarily be involved nor would the time or circumstances of a
                                peace conference be directly affected.</p>

                            <p>The Supreme Commander has not made formal reply to the Soviet
                                Member’s letter, but on June 13 released to the press an
                                exceptionally blunt comment on the Soviet Member’s communication. A
                                copy of General MacArthur’s statement is enclosed.</p>
                            <p>In view of the extraordinarily caustic character of the Supreme
                                Commander’s comment, there is a possibility that the Soviet
                                Government may make further issue of this matter, either in the Far
                                Eastern Commission or in the Allied Council for Japan. This Mission
                                has accordingly requested the <gloss target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>

                                    misrepresentations of fact, could be disregarded as routine
                                    Soviet propaganda did it not so completely unmask the Soviet
                                    role as an incitor of disorder and violence in an otherwise
                                    orderly Japanese society. The thorough duplicity of its apparent
                                    championship of fundamental human rights on the one hand and the
                                    Soviet callous indifference to the release for repatriation of
                                    Japanese prisoners of war on the other—its talk of greater
                                    liberality for Japanese workers and the Soviet practice of labor
                                    exploitation, is a shocking demonstration of inconsistent
                                    demagoguery. The purpose of the letter is obviously two-fold: to
                                    incite irresponsible and unruly minority elements in Japan to
                                    violence and disorderly resistance against the duly constituted
                                    government of Japan and the lawful orders and processes thereof
                                    with a view to creating confusion, unrest and bewilderment in
                                    the ranks of the law-abiding Japanese masses, and to screen the
                                    Soviet unconscionable failure to abide by the requirements of
                                    International Law and specific Potsdam commitments in the return
                                    of over four hundred thousand Japanese citizens, long held in
                                    bondage, to their homeland. This failure to meet international
                                    commitments and maintain normal standards of human decency in

                                    civilization, and is calculated so to outrage moral
                                    sensibilities that even the Japanese Communists have been moved
                                    to register a bitter and indignant protest. The burdened effort
                                    at this late date to challenge the number long publicly recorded
                                    as held in Soviet hands by charging mathematical error is small
                                    solace indeed to hundreds of thousands of Japanese homes from
                                    whom no sophistry can conceal the fact that a family member in
                                    Soviet custody has failed to return; and as to whom, contrary to
                                    all international covenants respecting prisoners of war, no word
                                    whatsoever has been received during the long period of
                                    captivity.</p>
                                <p>“For the Soviet to speak in derogation of the status of labor in
                                    Japan is hypocrisy compounded. His premise is based upon such
                                    fantastic exaggerations as obviously to belie the truth. The
                                    Japanese labor laws match the most progressive in their
                                    liberality and advanced concepts, and the labor movement here,
                                    despite its immaturity, has advanced more rapidly and with less
                                    friction than has its counterpart in many of the democratic
                                    countries of the world. Incidents of violence have been rare
                                    indeed and no segment of Japanese society has made such
                                    democratic gains as labor which enjoys rights and liberties and
                                    safeguards largely unknown to the peoples of the Soviet Union,
                                    which, following the totalitarian concept, holds under ruthless
                                    suppression individual liberty and personal dignity.</p>
                                <p>“For the Soviet to speak of ‘Democratic rights’, ‘the suppression
                                    of legal activities’, ‘arbitrariness and chastisement’, is
                                    enough to challenge the late lamented Ripley at his
                                    imagination’s best and leads one to conclude that now there must
                                    really be nothing new under the sun.”</p>

                                    <item>The Japanese Islands are of high strategic importance to
                                        United States security interests in the Far East, primarily
                                        because of their geographic location with respect to the
                                        trade routes of the North Pacific, the exits and entrances
                                        of the Sea of Japan, the East China and Yellow Seas, and, to
                                        a lesser degree, the ports of Asia north of the
                                        Shanghai–Woosung area, inclusive. Japan, also because of her
                                        geographic location, could under USSR control be used as a
                                        base for aggressive action directly against United States
                                        bases in the Western Pacific, in anticipation of
                                        step-by-step advances eastward and to the Southeast Asia
                                        region. Conversely, United States control of Japan, either
                                        directly or indirectly, will not only deny to the USSR an
                                        extremely important strategic base for aggressive or
                                        defensive action but also, in the event of war, will make
                                        available to us strategic outposts for early denial to the
                                        USSR, and eventually for control or neutralization by us, of
                                        the Sea of Japan and the Yellow and East China Seas. In
                                        addition, it would provide us with staging areas from which
                                        to project our military power to the Asiastic mainland and
                                        to USSR islands adjacent thereto.</item>

                                        the logistic demand that would need to be met in making her

                                        the interests of the United States in the event of global

                                    <item>The ability of the Japanese to wage both aggressive and
                                        defensive war was proven in the last world conflict. It is
                                        almost inconceivable that the Japanese manpower potential
                                        would be permitted to continue in peaceful pursuits in the
                                        event of another global conflict. Under USSR control, Japan
                                        probably would provide both the arsenal personnel and the
                                        manpower for aggressive military campaigns in the Pacific
                                        and to the southwest. If United States influence
                                        predominates, Japan can be expected, with planned initial
                                        United States assistance, at least to protect herself and,
                                        provided logistic necessities can be made available to her,
                                        to contribute importantly to military operations against the
                                        Soviets in Asia, thus forcing the USSR to fight on the

                                                is still satisfactory from the military viewpoint,
                                                on the assumption that events permit a peace treaty
                                                to be worked out that adequately safeguards the
                                                Western orientation of Japan. The Navy Department
                                                has examined the possibilities of Okinawa for
                                                development as a naval base and has determined that
                                                it is not suitable as a year-around naval base
                                                because of unfavorable meteorological and
                                                hydrographic features. The Joint Chiefs of Staff,

                                                continued use of Yokosuka as a base are of major
                                                importance. To provide against future contingencies,
                                                the peace treaty should not be such as to preclude

                                    <item>From the military viewpoint, it is clear, as discussed
                                        initially in this memorandum, that the developing chaos on
                                        the Asiatic mainland, together with its communistic trend,
                                        makes it vital that, with or without a peace treaty, the
                                        orientation of Japan towards the West be assured. At the
                                        same time, the difficulty of achieving and maintaining such
                                        assurance has increased and it can be foreseen that economic
                                        and political pressure may well cause the problem to become
                                        very great indeed. This makes the question of Japanese
                                        internal security more important than ever. In turn, and
                                        commensurate with the degree to which Japanese western
                                        orientation is maintained, Japan’s capacity for self-defense
                                        must be developed against the time when it may be determined
                                        by the Soviets that overt aggression by them or their
                                        satellites is their only means for gaining control over

                                        peace treaty would, at the present time, be premature since
                                        the continuing Soviet policy of aggressive communist
                                        expansion makes it essential that Japan’s democracy and

                                Section of General Headquarters recommending to the Chief of Staff
                                that the Ryukyu Islands be permitted limited self-government. This
                                Mission in its capacity as the Diplomatic Section of General
                                Headquarters has concurred in these recommendations.</p>
                            <p>As indicated in the enclosures to this Mission’s despatch no. 713,
                                the problem of the extent to which the Ryukyus should be permitted
                                self-government has been thoroughly considered by General
                                Headquarters. A committee was established for the purpose of
                                recommending policies conducive to the development of government by
                                the four island groups of the Ryukyus. In accordance with the
                                recommendations of this committee, the Ryukyus Military Government
                                Section now proposes to instruct the Military Governor of the
                                Ryukyus to establish procedures whereby progressive self-government
                                in the islands will be realized. The first of these steps will be
                                elections in late 1950 in each of the four island groups for the
                                election of governors and assemblies. A Ryukyus Advisory Council to
                                advise the Military Governor will also be selected. It is not
                                planned that a constitution for the Ryukyus Islands as a whole will
                                be drawn up at this time, nor will a central assembly composed of
                                Ryukyuans be established. The United States Military Government will
                                remain as the legal central government in the Ryukyus at least for
                                the immediate future.</p>
                            <p>The above recommendations will, upon approval by the Chief of Staff,
                                be transmitted to the Military Governor of the Ryukyus for
                                implementation and a telegram will be sent to the Department of the
                                Army informing it of the steps being taken.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have been rather
                                disturbed recently over recurrent Washington datelined press
                                dispatches reflecting a trend of thought in official circles that a
                                change in the regime of control in Japan, patterned after the plan
                                now being implemented for the United States Zone of Germany, would
                                not only be a desirable development but susceptible of
                                accomplishment with no less difficulty. This trend of thought either
                                fails to understand or ignores the structural set-up which, largely
                                under your skillful guiding hand, was fashioned in Moscow during
                                late 1945 and the basic distinctions which otherwise exist between
                                the situation in Germany and that existing in Japan.</p>
                            <p>I know that you are deeply preoccupied with the difficult European
                                problems which confront you and have probably prevented much thought
                                being given to this relatively quiet sector in Japan, but against
                                the possibility that the Japanese problem might suddenly be brought
                                up for serious consideration I thought that I should give you my
                                views and estimates thereon. Much of what I have to say will be well
                                known to you but it is difficult to discuss so broad a subject
                                piecemeal without showing the connections between inter-related
                                parts.</p>
                            <p>Here there is no military government functioning in the
                                administration of Japanese civil affairs, as throughout the
                                Occupation I have permitted the Japanese civil government in all of
                                its branches and sub-divisions to function, subject only to the
                                close observation and inherent authority of the Supreme Commander
                                for the Allied Powers to intervene at any time as in his judgment
                                necessary to support Allied objectives. No military government has
                                been established here which, incidentally, eliminated the call upon
                                United States manpower which otherwise would have been required.
                                Such United States personnel as are required to carry on the civil
                                phase of the Occupation consist for the most part in specially
                                qualified civilians recruited in Washington. Thus, in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> Headquarters organization, out of
                                2,798 persons on duty, 2,443 are civilian.</p>
                            <p>The situation here is thus entirely different than that prevailing in
                                the United States Zone of Germany where Mr. McCloy is about to enter
                                upon his duties as High Commissioner. There the American forces have
                                actually governed through an established and functioning military
                                government, with a civil German government only just about to be
                                inaugurated. In addition, the United States has maintained
                                unilateral <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0193"/>control over
                                policy and administration from the start in its zone of Germany.
                                Here in Japan, to the contrary, such unilateral control was yielded
                                at the Moscow Conference in late 1945 when an Allied set-up was
                                agreed upon by the United States, in concert with the other major
                                powers, for the administration of the Occupation. This set-up
                                embodied a civilian agency, termed the Far Eastern Commission,
                                composed of representatives of the eleven Pacific powers, sitting in
                                Washington, to formulate policy; the Allied Council for Japan,
                                composed of the United States, British Commonwealth, China and the
                                Soviet, sitting in Tokyo, to act as an advisory and consultative
                                body to the Supreme Commander; and the Supreme Commander for the
                                Allied Powers, acting as the sole executive authority for the Allies
                                in Japan. Since then the international character of the Occupation
                                has expanded through the organization of the Inter-Allied Trade
                                Board for Japan, the Separations Technical Advisory Committee, and
                                other Allied civilian agencies, in the implementation of Far Eastern
                                Commission policy. For general security purposes the Supreme
                                Commander has under him American Occupation Forces, under the
                                immediate command of <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>, the
                                British Commonwealth Forces, and all Allied ground, Naval and Air
                                Forces in Japan.</p>
                            <p>The United States could, with respect to the American zone of
                                Germany, alter the regime of control at will, but by the express
                                terms of the Moscow Agreement, any change in the regime of
                                Occupation control in Japan there agreed upon was specifically
                                reserved to the Far Eastern Commission. It so happens that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> is also the Supreme
                                Commander for the Allied Powers, pursuant to agreement reached among
                                the four major Allied powers in consultation at the time of the
                                cessation of hostilities. While such action was taken before the
                                regime of control was determined upon at Moscow and the eleven
                                Pacific nations vested with the policy-making power, specific
                                confirmation at such conference was given to the appointment and
                                authority of the Supreme Commander. Change in that regime of control
                                to permit the State Department to assume a position in Japan
                                analogous to that it is about to assume in Germany would, in
                                accordance with the terms of reference of the Moscow Agreement,
                                require the consent of a majority of the Far Eastern Commission,
                                including the United States, Britain, Russia and China, each of
                                which possesses the veto power on that body. It is most unlikely
                                that such an agreement would be forthcoming as the nations involved
                                would thereby be required to partially yield their influence in the
                                future orientation and control of Japan. By no stretch of
                                imagination, moreover, could such a change be regarded as a transfer
                                from a military to civil administration. It is merely an incident
                                that the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers here is a military
                                officer. He has functioned entirely as the executive head of a
                                civilian administration. The few military personnel <pb n="780"
                                    xml:id="pg_780" facs="0194"/>which <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"

                                    >CINCFE</gloss> are merely to supplement the paucity of civilian
                                personnel otherwise available to him.</p>
                            <p>But apart from this, and of infinitely greater importance, no move
                                could be more calculated to destroy the remaining prestige of the
                                United States in the Far East than a serious effort toward such a
                                change. Nothing would give greater impetus to the Communist drive to
                                bring all of Asia under control. Oriental reactions differ widely
                                from occidental reactions, and a drastic readjustment in the regime
                                of control here would certainly be interpreted as indicative of an
                                Allied weakening in their determination to further the objectives
                                enunciated in the surrender terms. It could not fail to be regarded
                                as a decisive step toward yielding in the face of Communist
                                successes in China and as a tacit acknowledgment of our inability to
                                maintain our position, support our responsibilities and defend our
                                rights and interests in the Far East. This is no mere conjecture. I
                                have seen the convulsions here which accompanied every serious
                                suggestion which has been made with any color of authority that
                                American policy might be reoriented toward a weakening of the
                                American position in the Pacific, such as former Secretary Royall is
                                reported to have made on his trip to Japan and as has freqently been
                                the purport of press dispatches from Washington, mostly speculative,
                                but some bearing the stamp of seeming official authenticity.</p>
                            <p>The United States has emerged through three and a half years of a
                                predominantly American Occupation to occupy a unique position in the
                                hearts of the Japanese people. It is a position of respect bordering
                                on reverence and veneration. This has largely been brought about by
                                the character of the Occupation and its guiding philosophy. It has
                                been a military Occupation only in a formal sense and because
                                inherent in it lies the ultimate authority of military force.
                                Essentially it has been administered along civil lines. To some
                                Japanese the presence of troops, with its connotations of order and
                                discipline, has had greatest appeal and most far-reaching influence.
                                But to most, the benign qualities of the Occupation policy and
                                administration, the bestowal and safeguard of human rights, and the
                                social reformation to enhance individual dignity have made a
                                penetrating and lasting impression. But the combination of both has
                                brought to the great masses of the Japanese people a sense of
                                confidence and faith and a feeling of complete security in the
                                American effort and purpose. This is the strong spiritual front
                                which has been erected here in Japan against the Communist advance
                                in Asia.</p>
                            <p>To speak of civilianizing the Occupation is to speak in riddles. It
                                is, and always has been, civilianized. It is merely incidental that
                                its chief administrator came from the military ranks. On the other
                                hand, experience has clearly demonstrated that even public
                                speculation of such a change is widely interpreted in the oriental
                                mind as pointing to <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0195"/>a
                                relaxation of the firm anti-Communist stand we have taken here, with
                                the view of an ultimate withdrawal from our position in the Far
                                East. This but fertilizes the field for Communist conversion and
                                expansion and tends to undermine and sabotage our efforts at this
                                and other strategic Pacific areas to contain the Communist advance
                                and preserve a front safe for democratic growth, without offering
                                the slightest basis for hope that advantage might result from such a
                                change, even if possible of implementation.</p>
                            <p>I cannot too strongly urge that, pending developments with the Soviet
                                which would make a peace treaty possible, every effort to effect a
                                change in the regime of control such as has been suggested,
                                foreshadowing a weakening of our purpose to maintain invincibly our
                                position, be sharply resisted. The scales are far too delicately
                                balanced recklessly to experiment with doubtful change in an area
                                from which has emerged a pattern of general success. To tamper
                                unduly with such a situation is but to prejudice the security of our
                                position and hazard every gain made in the course of the Occupation
                                and otherwise invite catastrophic consequences throughout Asia.</p>
                            <p>The estimate I have made is so conclusive in evidenciary support that
                                I earnestly hope that before any such change becomes a potential
                                reality you will advise me in order that I may lay my views before
                                you in much fuller detail, as well as before the President.</p>
                            <p>We are still hoping that the burdens upon you from Europe will abate
                                sufficiently to permit you a visit to this area of the world. I
                                cannot but repeat that such an eventuality would have a profoundly
                                beneficial effect upon the morale of the Asian peoples.</p>

                                of Occupation Controls in Japan</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch no. 298
                                of May 10, 1949, on the above subject, I have the honor to report
                                that the Chief of Staff, Major General E. M. Almond, held a second
                                meeting yesterday of the Chiefs of Headquarters Staff Sections for
                                the purpose of discussing progress so far made in the program for
                                effecting a general relaxation of Occupation controls in Japan. He
                                declared that good progress had been made so far and expressed
                                satisfaction with the preliminary work already done in the form of
                                reports by the various Section Chiefs.</p>
                            <pb n="782" xml:id="pg_782" facs="0196"/>
                            <p>The next step, General Almond stated, would be to have each Section
                                report gone over carefully by a committee comprising representatives
                                of several Staff Sections, under the direction of the Deputy Chief
                                of Staff for <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, Major General
                                (recently promoted) A. P. Fox, after which the committee will
                                discuss each Section report with the respective Section Chief with a
                                view to determining whether everything possible is being done to
                                relax the occupational controls pertaining to that particular
                                Section.</p>
                            <p>General Fox exhibited a chart showing results of a preliminary
                                examination and collation of the reports submitted indicating that
                                1,362 controls are now in effect, 1,041 of which had been
                                recommended for continuation, 141 for relaxation or modification,
                                and 180 for elimination. On this basis, 76 per cent of existing
                                controls would be continued, 11 per cent relaxed and 13 per cent
                                eliminated.</p>
                            <p>General Almond took occasion to urge Section Chiefs to redouble their
                                efforts to find means of reducing Occupation personnel requirements,
                                saying wryly that despite efforts so far made in that direction
                                personnel estimates prepared for the new budget had reached a total
                                of one hundred persons more than had been on the rolls for the
                                fiscal year just ended.</p>
                            <p>General Almond stated that all major Occupation policies have now

                                which is now being studied by Dr. Carl S. Shoup and the members of
                                his tax mission. He also said that plans were now completed for the
                                conversion of Military Government teams into “Civil Affairs” teams
                                and that examples of the easing of controls already achieved
                                included the modification of restrictions on commercial entrants,
                                increased facilities for tourist travel and authorization for the
                                Japanese Government to communicate with its nationals abroad.</p>
                            <p>General Almond emphasized that he was being pressed by General
                                MacArthur to effect a genuine relaxation of controls and urged each

                                External Affairs setting forth the views of the New Zealand
                                Government on these matters.</p>
                            <p>It will be noted that the New Zealand Government, primarily because
                                of anxiety concerning the long term security interests of all the
                                Allies, doubts whether the United States policy with respect to
                                conversion and scrapping can prove an adequate substitute for a
                                removal program.</p>
                            <p>The preoccupation of the New Zealand Government with long term
                                security in the Far East here expressed has been noted frequently by
                                officers of the Embassy in conversations with officials of the
                                Ministry of External Affairs. They are deeply concerned over the
                                rapidity of developments in the Far East and feel that there is an
                                urgent need for counter measures. In considering the problems
                                involved, however, they feel frustrated by what they consider to be
                                the lack of a United States Far Eastern policy.</p>
                            <p>The Department will also note that the Ministry has taken this
                                opportunity to reiterate indirectly its conviction that matters
                                relating to Japan should be handled through the Far Eastern
                                Commission by means of broad policy directives rather than through
                                any other channels.</p>

                                General Headquarters and the Japanese Government on June 20 that
                                during the period June 25 to June 30 repatriation vessels can be

                                are scheduled for repatriation. The Soviet notification gave no
                                information as to further repatriation after June 30. A copy of the
                                Soviet notification is enclosed.<note n="1" xml:id="d102fn2">Not

                            <p>General MacArthur’s comment notes the delay in resuming repatriation
                                as compared with previous years when the Soviet authorities lifted
                                winter suspension on May 3 in 1948 and on April 3 in 1947. The
                                comment also states that the Supreme Commander is prepared
                                immediately to receive repatriates from any Asiatic ports the Soviet
                                Government may designate and recalls the Supreme Commander’s
                                previous offers to furnish shipping sufficient to accomplish
                                repatriation at rates far in excess of the 50,000 monthly quota
                                provided in the Soviet-<gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                Repatriation Agreement. Finally, the comment notes that the Soviet
                                Government since June, 1947, has failed to meet the 50,000 monthly
                                quota, and that as of May 31, 1949, repatriation has averaged only
                                30,570 repatriates monthly.</p>

                                dated June 21, 1949, announcing that the term “Military Government”
                                will be changed to “Civil Affairs” commencing July 1, 1949.</p>

                                    was announced today by General Headquarters, Supreme Commander
                                    for the Allied Powers.</p>
                                <p>The announcement stated that the term Military Government has
                                    always been misleading in that it implied that direct Military
                                    Government has been exercised in Japan in a manner similar to
                                    that in other occupied areas. From the beginning the Japanese
                                    Government has been charged with carrying out Occupation
                                    directives and Military Government, in the accepted sense of the
                                    term, was never established in Japan. The mission of the
                                    so-called Military Government Sections and Teams is one of
                                    surveillance and reporting upon performance.</p>
                                <p>It was pointed out that, in keeping with the changing aspect of
                                    the Occupation, the term Civil Affairs will be adopted as being
                                    more nearly descriptive of the true functions of the Occupation
                                    agencies.</p>
                            </quote>
                            <p>This change represents a further step by Headquarters in its program
                                of conferring more authority upon the Japanese Government and in
                                reducing the role of the Occupation. It is not expected, however,
                                that the functions of Civil Affairs agencies will be materially
                                diminished by this change in title.</p>

                                exercised by Japanese courts with respect to United Nations
                                nationals, but that such criminal jurisdiction will be exercised by
                                military courts established by the forces of occupation.</p>
                            <p>The Department of the Army has received a cable from General
                                MacArthur (C 50913, 21 June 1949), a copy of which has been
                                furnished Mr. Max Bishop, requesting that steps be taken to amend
                                the directive of 23 August 1946. General MacArthur now believes that
                                the Japanese should be authorized to exercise concurrent criminal
                                jurisdiction over United Nations nationals, with the exception of
                                those members of the United Nations enumerated in 1<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>. of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> directive.
                                He states the occupation will be able to observe and correct, if
                                necessary, any discriminatory or abusive practices in the event that
                                the Japanese are permitted to exercise such limited concurrent
                                criminal jurisdiction over United Nations nationals. It is noted
                                that such a step would be in consonance with United States policy
                                toward Japan, with respect to relaxing occupation controls and
                                placing increased responsibility upon the Japanese government.</p>
                            <p>The Department of the Army is in complete agreement with General
                                MacArthur in amending the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive of 23
                                August 1946, and therefore recommends that the Department of State
                                introduce an appropriate proposal on this matter into the Far
                                Eastern Commission.</p>

                                        Malta and Yalta, 1945, 984</ref>.</note> is the primary
                                basis of the Soviet Union’s present position in southern Sakhalin
                                and the Kuril Islands. This agreement provided for the entry of the
                                Soviet Union into war against Japan two or three months after
                                termination of the war in Europe, on several conditions one of which
                                was that “The Kuril islands shall be handed over to the Soviet
                                Union.” There was, however, no definition of the term Kuril Islands.
                                Since the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island have been
                                traditionally regarded as an island group distinct from the Kuril
                                archipelago, and under Japanese control had a local administration
                                as a political subdivision of Hokkaido separate from the Kuril
                                island local administration, there appears no valid basis, either in
                                the Yalta Agreement or in any other international understanding,
                                justifying Soviet occupation of the Habomai-Shikotan area at the end
                                of the war in addition to the Soviet occupation of the Kuril
                                Islands. It can only be concluded, therefore, that the Soviet
                                occupation of the Habomai Group and Shikotan Island was a unilateral
                                action for which no more previous understanding had been reached
                                than for Soviet occupation of the island of Hokkaido.</p>
                            <p>Although the Yalta Agreement did not specifically provide for the
                                actual occupation by Soviet forces of the Kuril Islands (or any
                                other area), it did of course contemplate military operations
                                against Japanese forces after the Soviet Uniones entry into the war
                                against Japan (which took place on August 8, 1945). The Yalta
                                Agreement’s provision for the ultimate disposition of the Kuril
                                Islands unquestionably afforded ample justification for the invasion
                                and occupation of this area by Soviet forces. This action was, of
                                course, recognized in General Order No. 1 issued to the Japanese
                                Government by the Supreme Commander on September 2, 1945, which
                                provided that Japanese forces in Manchuria, North Korea, southern
                                Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands were to surrender to the
                                Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East.</p>
                            <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0203"/>
                            <p>From Japanese sources it has been learned, however, that on the basis
                                of a surrender agreement concluded on August 19, 1945, in Manchuria
                                between the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in the Far East and
                                the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Japanese forces
                                throughout the entire Kuril chain and in the Habomai Group and
                                Shikotan had ceased hostilities and surrendered their arms before
                                General Order No. 1 was issued on September 2. It may be said,
                                therefore, that the Soviet Union, while invading and occupying the
                                Kuril Islands, lost no time in extending this military operation to
                                include the Habomai–Shikotan area, thus confronting the Allied

                                out by General Headquarters through a directive to the Japanese
                                Government on January 29, 1946 (<gloss target="#t_Scapin1"
                                    >Scapin</gloss> 677). In defining the areas to be separated from
                                Japan governmentally and administratively, <gloss
                                    target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss> 677 specifically enumerates
                                the Kuril Islands as well as the Habomai Group and Shikotan Island.
                                Historically, this is the first time that the Habomai–Shikotan area
                                is dealt with in a document of international character concerned
                                with the territorial boundaries of Japan. Although the
                                Habomai-Shikotan area was under Soviet occupation at the time <gloss

                                tended to endorse if not validate the Soviet position there. In a
                                sense, therefore, it is believed that <gloss target="#t_Scapin1"
                                    >Scapin</gloss> 677, while fundamentally a General Headquarters

                                Yalta Agreement.</p>

                                of June 22, 1946, as amended, will also no doubt be cited as
                                supporting the Soviet position in the Kuril Islands and the
                                Habomai–Shikotan area by its exclusion of these islands from the

                            <p>From the historical standpoint, Japan is believed to have a sound

                                maps plainly indicate that from at least the beginning of the 17th
                                century the Japanese regarded the Kuril Islands and the
                                Habomai–Shikotan area as Japanese territory. Moreover, there is
                                abundant historical evidence to show that the Japanese through
                                almost the entire Tokugawa period (1600–1868) provided some degree
                                of political administration for the Habomai Group, Shikotan, and the
                                islands of Kunashiri and Etorofu in the Kuril archipelago. In
                                contrast, the earliest known Russian activity in the Kuril Islands
                                did not begin until early in the 18th century, and there is little
                                evidence of real Russian political administration in any of the
                                islands until the 19th century.</p>
                            <p>The first treaty between Japan and Russia, signed at Shimoda in 1855,
                                clearly divided the Kuril Islands between the two countries at the
                                Etorofu Straits. By the Saint Petersburg Treaty of 1875, Japan, in
                                exchange for relinquishing her rights and interests in Sakhalin to
                                Russia, received from Russia the Kuril Islands northeast of the
                                Etorofu Straits. Thereafter, the Kuril Islands were never the
                                subject of dispute or discussion between the two countries. The
                                Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island, on the other hand, were never
                                discussed in connection with the treaty settlements in 1855 and
                                1875, their Japanese status never theretofore having been
                                disputed.</p>
                            <p>With the establishment of Japan’s modern system of political
                                subdivisions and administration after the Meiji Restoration in 1868,
                                the Kuril Islands in the possession of Japan were made integral
                                parts of the Hokkaido prefectural government, forming various
                                districts of Chishima-gun, or Chishima County, which is in turn part
                                of the Nemuro Shicho, or Nemuro Branch Administration. The Habomai
                                Islands and Shikotan Island constituted another administrative
                                subdivision of the Nemuro Shicho.</p>
                            <p>There appears to be a tendency to think of the so-called “minor
                                outlying islands” off the Japanese coasts independently of their
                                historical relationships to Japan and the long periods over which
                                some of them have formed integral parts of the Japanese home
                                administration. It is believed that any peace settlement with Japan
                                should give adequate weight to these important historical and
                                administrative considerations.</p>
                            <p>In the case of the Kuril Islands, the Habomai Group, and Shikotan
                                Island, their permanent transfer to the Soviet Union would
                                necessitate complete disregard of Japanese territorial claims which
                                are virtually as valid as the Japanese claim to the island of
                                Hokkaido. It is therefore believed that, in the event of a peace
                                settlement, Japan is reasonably entitled to expect some readjustment
                                of the territorial provisions of the Yalta Agreement, as now
                                supplemented by the provisions and implications of <gloss
                                    target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss> 677 and <gloss
                                    target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss> 1033. It is believed that
                                consideration should be given to the fact that, of the Kuril
                                Islands, Etorofu and Kunashiri have always been regarded as <pb
                                    n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0205"/>Japanese territory, a fact
                                which Russia formally recognized in its earliest treaty with Japan,
                                the Shimoda Treaty of 1855; and that the Habomai Islands and
                                Shikotan Island have likewise always been regarded as Japanese
                                territory, their possession by Japan never having been previously
                                contested or violated until the unilateral occupation of the area by
                                Soviet forces in 1945.</p>
                            <p>There are also believed to be other important considerations which
                                would justify territorial readjustments in this area. The present
                                administrative boundary between Japan and Soviet-occupied islands
                                off the eastern coast of Hokkaido is a tortuous line running through
                                narrow, fog-bound channels which during the fishing season bear
                                considerable traffic. If this line becomes a permanent boundary
                                there will unquestionably occur continuous violations of Soviet
                                waters by Japanese craft and violations of Japanese waters by Soviet
                                shipping. The separation from Japan of the southern Kuril Islands,
                                the Habomai Group, and Shikotan also deprives the Hokkaido fisheries
                                of an important fishing area, the loss of which represents an
                                undesirable restriction on Japan’s overtaxed facilities for
                                producing foodstuffs. Finally, it should also be recognized that
                                Soviet possession of Kunashiri Island and the Habomai Group brings
                                Soviet power within exceedingly close proximity of metropolitan
                                Japan, a situation which the Japanese cannot help but regard as a
                                grave strategic liability.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that the most satisfactory and effective territorial
                                adjustment could be made by restoring to Japan the two southernmost
                                Kuril Islands of Etorofu and Kunashiri, the Habomai Islands, and
                                Shikotan Island. The relinquishment of this territory, totalling
                                1,868.69 square miles, could be no substantial loss or burden to the
                                Soviet Union, while its future possession by Japan could not
                                conceivably represent a strategic threat to the Soviet Union or
                                materially assist Japan’s hypothetical revival as a military power.
                                On the other hand, the recovery of this territory by Japan is in
                                conformity with valid historical consideration, would enable Japan
                                to rehabilitate the vital Hokkaido fisheries, and would eliminate an
                                impractical and controversial political boundary between Japanese
                                and Soviet territory.</p>

                            <p>I have discussed this with the Secretary, and he is giving the most
                                careful consideration to the views you put forth, the importance of
                                which he fully appreciates. I am sure that you will hear from him in
                                the near future. I am personally very glad that you were good enough
                                to let him have your views directly on this matter. We are moving
                                into a new and difficult phase of foreign policy not only in Asia
                                but in Europe as well; and there is need for the utmost in contact
                                and understanding between all of those who share the tremendous
                                burdens of outstanding responsibility in the handling of our
                                Government’s affairs abroad.</p>
                            <p>I need not say that I continue to look back on my visit to Tokyo with
                                gratitude for the hospitality I was shown and with satisfaction over
                                the help which the visit gave to all of us here in understanding
                                your problems. I do indeed hope that I may be able to visit the Far
                                East again before too many months have passed; but I doubt that it
                                could be before next winter.</p>

                                    broad policy. Situation in Japan today calls for more than

                                    participation in international relationships the Japanese will

                                    appears to have sufficient discretionary powers at present to
                                    permit Japanese participation in international relationships. It
                                    should be emphasized, however, that final authority for such
                                    participation remains with governments concerned. International
                                    relationships are mutual undertaking and unless all governments
                                    in spirit of leadership seek to dissipate vestiges of hatred and
                                    bitterness which are inevitable aftermath of war, little can be
                                    accomplished. Each government obviously has right to refuse to
                                    enter into relationships with Japan or to deny Japanese access
                                    to its territory. <pb n="795" xml:id="pg_795" facs="0209"
                                    />Likewise, determination of whether or not Japan should be
                                    invited to participate in conferences or international
                                    organizations lies with member governments concerned.</p>
                                <p>While US Government attaches greater importance to the broad
                                    political aspects of this problem, it has not overlooked legal
                                    implications including points such as those mentioned by French
                                    Government. French Government states that basic Post-Surrender
                                    Policy did not provide that <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                    might be progressively deprived, as regards the control of
                                    Japan’s foreign relations, of the powers given to it by the
                                    Moscow Agreement of December 27, 1945. US does not consider that
                                    passage by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> of policy
                                    decision deprives <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> of further
                                    jurisdiction over or consideration of that problem. In approving
                                    proposed policy <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> would merely
                                    be performing its proper role of formulating policy guidance
                                    which <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> will implement on
                                    behalf of all <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries. In
                                    accordance with past practice, this would not constitute a loss
                                    of <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> jurisdiction. Moreover,
                                    Commission under paragraph III, A 2 has authority to review any
                                    action of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> involving <gloss
                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decisions.</p>
                                <p>The French Government contends that discretionary powers in field
                                    of Japanese foreign relations cannot however be delegated to
                                        <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> by <gloss
                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> as neither Commission nor
                                    individual governments represented in it possess powers to
                                    affect Japan’s international relationships. This accords with
                                    principle expressed by US Government that international
                                    relationships are mutual and are dependent upon the individual
                                    countries concerned. For this reason and with the desire to have
                                        <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries take the
                                    leadership in opening the way to Japan, the US put forward its
                                    proposal. In view of US, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                    already possesses sufficient legal powers to act on his own in
                                    this respect. US Government considers that military occupants of
                                    conquered and subjugated country have supreme power over
                                    territory occupied, and in particular possess unquestioned right
                                    to regulate all intercourse between country under their control
                                    and outside world. Consequently, it is entirely reasonable and
                                    in accord with international agreement which created <gloss
                                        target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> as the sole executive
                                    authority for the Allied powers that right of the Allied Powers
                                    as belligerent occupants of Japan to regulate all intercourse
                                    between Japan and the outside world should be exercised by
                                        <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. Such, indeed, is now
                                    the case. The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> is fully
                                    entitled to formulate policies with regard to the regulation of
                                    intercourse between Japan and other countries and in fact, in
                                    the Basic Post Surrender Policy, accepted obligation to bring
                                    about the establishment of Japanese Government which will carry
                                    out its international obligations. Acting under this and other
                                    broad policy provisions, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>,
                                    in the absence of a contrary <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                    policy, possesses adequate discretionary powers. The US
                                    Government shares view of the French Government that acceptance
                                    of Japan cannot be forced on other governments by <gloss
                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> or by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                        >SCAP</gloss>.</p>
                                <p>With reference to suggestion that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                        >SCAP</gloss> notify Commission, for its information, of any
                                    decision taken regarding Japanese participation in international
                                    non-political conferences, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                    is already following this practice, with which the US is in full
                                    accord.</p>
                                <p>The French Government also proposed that any commitments which
                                    might be subscribed to by the Japanese Government in bilateral
                                    or multilateral agreements of a technical character should be
                                    ultimately submitted to <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> for
                                    its approval. The US Government feels that <pb n="796"
                                        xml:id="pg_796" facs="0210"/>such a proposal is
                                    impracticable. The <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> can
                                    hardly become an administrative organ in the field of Japan’s
                                    foreign relationships any more than it can become an
                                    administrative organ for Japanese internal relationships. The
                                        <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, of course, has the
                                    power to review any of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s
                                    actions approving Japan’s participation in bilateral or
                                    multilateral agreements.</p>
                                <p>The US Government trusts that French Government will agree that
                                    situation in Japan in the matter of international relationships
                                    is not comparable with that in Germany. US fails to see any
                                    constructive purposes to be served by attempting to formulate
                                    parallel procedures for two countries. Unlike Germany, Japan for
                                    past three years has had a representative and responsible
                                    government, subject to <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                    control. To prevent Japanese Government, under control of <gloss
                                        target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, from exercising further
                                    responsibility for which it has become adequately prepared in
                                    last three years, only because there has been no German
                                    Government to exercise a corresponding responsibility, is to
                                    penalize Japanese people for circumstances beyond their
                                    control.</p>
                                <p>While the US Government would welcome a further expression of
                                    views of the French Government especially in regard to broad
                                    political issues involved, it is the hope of this Government
                                    that French Government will be able to give sympathetic
                                    consideration and support to proposal for Japanese participation

                                of Mr. Bevin’s statement in the House of Commons on June 22
                                (Hansard, June 22, column 190) in reply to Mr. William Teeling’s
                                inquiry as to the steps which His Majesty’s Government will take to
                                bring about a peace treaty with Japan without Russian cooperation.
                                Mr. Bevin stated that the “future international status of Japan is
                                now under discussion in the Far Eastern Commission on proposals
                                recently submitted by the United States delegate. The measure of
                                agreement or disagreement in the forthcoming debates will doubtless
                                be a guide to His Majesty’s Government’s future action on this

                                be imposed on the aircraft manufacturing industry, or on the size
                                and speed of individual merchant ships constructed by Japan for
                                domestic use, or for export, or on the total volume of merchant
                                ships above a designated size built or owned by Japan. If it is

                            <p>2735. From Kennan: Discussed this morning with Dening Far Eastern
                                Affairs. Only point of interest that developed was revelation that
                                British now appear to understand completely need for special
                                arrangements to assure Japanese security in post treaty period and
                                would apparently be quite content that these arrangements be
                                bilateral as between US and Japan although they would, of course,
                                like to be in if we would have them. Their thought as to peace
                                treaty procedure is to repeat in a rough way pattern of developments
                                which we have seen in case on Germany: i.e. attempts to agree first
                                in body including Russians, then if anticipated disagreement
                                develops action without Russians by those nations willing to pursue
                                constructive policy.</p>
                            <p>In light of above I think it will not be hard to arrive at agreement,
                                with them on any program we may work out for progress toward
                                Japanese Peace Treaty. [Kennan.]</p>

                                in winding up the Advance Transfers Program of Japanese reparations
                                no further deliveries should be made to the Chinese mainland, but
                                that facilities “in process” for China at the time of termination of
                                the Program should be made available for delivery to Formosa if the
                                Chinese Mission in Tokyo indicated that the National Government so
                                desired. The Mission informed <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                on June 5 (Tab B) that the National Government did so desire.
                                However, in making the facilities available for removal <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> in an administrative ruling of
                                June 7 (Tab C) withheld the Kure Thermal Electric Power Plant and
                                the Kure Tower Crane, notwithstanding the facts that these
                                facilities had been allocated to China before termination of the
                                Advance Transfers Program and that the administrative ruling
                                established the general principle that allocated facilities should
                                be delivered to the claimant countries.</p>
                            <p>On June 28 the Department of State inquired through the Office of the
                                Acting Political Adviser (Tab D) what the considerations underlying
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s decision to retain the
                                Kure facilities were. <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> replied
                                on July 7 (Tab E) that since only a small percentage of the Kure
                                facilities had been dismantled and packed, and since the facilities
                                were required for purposes of Japanese recovery, local decision had
                                been made to retain them. This reply left unexplained, however, the
                                facts that (1) <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> had only a
                                short time before allocated the facilities to China, indicating that
                                he had not considered them necessary to Japanese recovery before
                                termination of the Advance Transfers Program, and (2) the criterion
                                of percentage of dismantling and packaging ran counter to the
                                general principle announced by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                on June 7 that allocated facilities would be delivered.</p>
                            <p>It is suggested, in the light of approved U.S. policies with respect
                                to Formosa, that General MacArthur be approached again to determine
                                whether the Kure facilities might not be delivered to Formosa along
                                with the other facilities allocated to China.</p>

                                with him. You may be interested in noting the General’s opinion that
                                this document constitutes a very good statement of United States
                                policy on Japan, despite the fact that he disagrees on certain
                                points, notably the question of the purgees, and that he resents
                                somewhat the Department’s view that there may be increasing Japanese
                                resentment against the Occupation.</p>
                            <p>I hope you will note especially General MacArthur’s opinion that the
                                United States should again take the lead in proposing the early
                                conclusion of a treaty of peace with Japan. He has been particularly
                                sensitive to anything that might contribute to the popular
                                impression that the United States does not want a treaty. He not
                                only believes that we should endeavor to obtain a treaty without
                                delay, but feels <pb n="804" xml:id="pg_804" facs="0218"/>that such
                                an effort would have a good chance of success at the present time,
                                the question with respect to Japan’s security being resolved by
                                international recognition of its neutrality, for which he would be
                                willing to accept the pledge of the Soviet Government.</p>
                            <p>In response to your request for comments and recommendations, my
                                first comment is that it is a pleasure to note the improvements
                                contained in this Policy Statement as compared with the previous
                                one. It shows a close awareness of all the major issues, and will be
                                particularly useful to us here in keeping the Department’s
                                viewpoints before us. I should like in the following paragraphs to
                                single out a few points for special comment.</p>
                            <p>On <ref target="frus1949v07p1#pg_5">page 5</ref> it is stated that:
                                “It is our objective to promote conditions conducive to friendly
                                relations between Japan and Korea, and accordingly to encourage the
                                early return to Korea of the bulk of the 600,000 Koreans now
                                resident in Japan, whose presence there is causing serious
                                problems.” This Mission heartily concurs in that objective, and I
                                hope that, after obtaining general approval by this Headquarters in
                                the not distant future to a study we have completed on the status of
                                Koreans in Japan, we shall be in a position to seek action in the
                                direction of the return to Korea of substantial numbers of the
                                Koreans now here. The subject has recently been brought again to our
                                attention by an initiative from the Prime Minister resulting from
                                Korean participation in current violence and illegal activity.</p>
                            <p>The reference on <ref target="frus1949v07p1#pg_7">page 7</ref> to the
                                complementary economies of Japan and China and the consequent
                                desirability of trade between these two countries has the full
                                support of this Mission. We here look upon this matter as having
                                special importance. Our efforts in this direction have not been as
                                successful as we may have hoped, and the obstacles obviously are
                                very great, but we shall continue trying to influence Headquarters
                                toward a fuller acceptance of this policy.</p>
                            <p>We are also especially interested just now in the question raised on
                                    <ref target="frus1949v07p1#pg_10">page 10</ref> with respect to
                                the desirability of permitting, in the field of foreign relations, a
                                steady return to the Japanese Government of at least certain
                                segments of its sovereignty in world affairs during the pre-treaty
                                period. We have this question under active study now with a view to
                                submitting concrete recommendations for General Headquarters’
                                approval. In conformity with the Department’s views, we not only
                                believe that the resumption of Japan’s membership in the Universal
                                Postal Union and in the International Telecommunication Union is
                                desirable, but feel it would likewise be a matter of policy to
                                advocate adherence by Japan (and to assist Japan in making its
                                adherence effective) to other international conventions and
                                agreements, including the International Whaling Convention, the
                                International Labor Organization, the International Trade
                                Organization, the Fur-Sealing Convention, which is understood to be
                                in process of preliminary <pb n="805" xml:id="pg_805" facs="0219"
                                />discussion, conventions on patents and copyrights, and such others
                                as the Department may find it desirable. Perhaps the Department
                                already has under study a determination of those international
                                conventions and agreements which are susceptible of adherence by
                                Japan. We are now actively endeavoring to secure Headquarters
                                approval for a program envisaging early Japanese trade and consular
                                representation in the United States and other countries.</p>
                            <p>On <ref target="frus1949v07p1#pg_14">page 14</ref> the Policy
                                Statement raises the question of the desirability of attempting to
                                bring about a peace treaty, even though it must be with the
                                realization that a general peace conference would be likely to fail,
                                it being important that the public should know the reasons for any
                                failure and that the way should be prepared for considering the
                                desirability of bringing about a bilateral agreement between the
                                United States and Japan, with a number of friendly powers following
                                suit. As already noted, General MacArthur’s views strongly support
                                this idea, and we here in the Mission, who naturally have devoted
                                considerable thought to the general problem of a peace settlement,
                                feel rather definitely that the time has come for taking some such
                                steps as those outlined in the Statement.</p>
                            <p>I shall show this Statement to Mr. Sebald upon his return to Tokyo on
                                July 23, and it is not unlikely that he may wish to send you
                                additional comments and suggestions at that time.</p>
                            <p>A receipt for the two copies of the Policy Statement, which also
                                indicates the disposition made of the two copies dated June 21,
                                1948, is being returned separately.</p>

                                <p>General MacArthur interrupted his reading to refer to the date of
                                    issuance on the cover page and to remark that the Statement was
                                    a little out of date, mentioning particularly the paragraph on
                                        <ref target="frus1949v07p1#pg_7">page 7</ref> which states
                                    that “we favor the early establishment of a single commercial
                                    exchange rate for the yen” and, a little later on, the section
                                    regarding reparations. Upon concluding his reading he asked one
                                    or two questions regarding the purpose of the Statement and the
                                    use made of it and then, upon being informed, said that,
                                    generally speaking, it represented a good statement and estimate
                                    of American foreign policy with respect to Japan. With most of
                                    the Statement, he said, he was in hearty agreement; on some
                                    details he would have to disagree. He went on to say that he had
                                    to disagree, in particular, with the Department’s position on
                                    the question of the two hundred thousand <pb n="806"
                                        xml:id="pg_806" facs="0220"/>purgees; he had done his level
                                    best in various ways to make the Department see the light, and
                                    especially to understand his own position, on this subject. In
                                    the first place, he said, most of these purgees were military
                                    officers, only a few hundred representing industry and other
                                    large business interests. In the second place, he continued, the
                                    Department simply would not see the fact that he was bound by
                                    the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decision on the
                                    purge and could not, and would not, carry out the Department’s
                                    wishes for a review of purged cases unless and until that policy
                                    decision was changed by the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                    itself. He spoke with some feeling in saying that the Department
                                    had been obdurate in not recognizing his point of view.</p>
                                <p>I drew General MacArthur’s attention particularly to that part of
                                    the Policy Statement which indicated that the present United
                                    States policy with respect to the timing of a treaty of peace
                                    with Japan is now under review, as well as to the statement that
                                    inability to agree on voting procedure has been of advantage in
                                    permitting the United States “to reassess the merits of the
                                    Chinese proposal that voting follow <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                        >FEC</gloss> procedure”. The General then declared
                                    emphatically that one of the greatest mistakes made by the
                                    United States with respect to Japan had been to permit the
                                    development, in this country and elsewhere, of the impression
                                    that it does not now want a treaty with Japan. “We should have a
                                    treaty,” he said, “and as soon as possible; even if we fail, we
                                    should make the attempt, for propaganda if for no other
                                    reasons.” He then reminded me that he had been disappointed when
                                    the American delegation at the recent meeting of the Council of
                                    Foreign Ministers had rejected the Soviet proposal to discuss
                                    the treaty with Japan; our interests would have been much
                                    further advanced, he said, if we had at that point indicated our
                                    readiness to discuss a treaty.</p>
                                <p>When I asked the General if he believed a treaty might now be
                                    possible and how, in the affirmative case, we could be assured
                                    of Japan’s security, he replied that he believed it might be
                                    possible to exact a pledge from all the nations concerned,
                                    including Soviet Russia, to respect the neutrality of an unarmed
                                    Japan. When I expressed concern regarding the amount of reliance
                                    which might be placed on such a pledge on the part of the Soviet
                                    Union, he remarked that the Soviets might indeed be difficult to
                                    deal with, but in his experience he had found that the Soviet
                                    Government always endeavored to keep its plighted word. (He
                                    interjected here that he was still convinced that the Soviet
                                    failure to carry out its repatriation commitments had been the
                                    result of physical inability, and not a lack of desire to carry
                                    out its agreement.) I indicated my inability to entertain like
                                    optimism with respect to Soviet proclivities for keeping
                                    agreements on the basis of the postwar record.</p>

                                <p>General MacArthur then referred to the Policy Statement’s mention
                                    of “increasing Japanese resentment against the Occupation” and
                                    proceeded to argue that such resentment does not, in fact,
                                    exist. The Japanese people are well aware, he said, of what we
                                    have done for them; they know that this has been a kind and
                                    helpful Occupation; they have seen us bring food into their
                                    country, restore the economic life, and manifest in many other
                                    ways that we are here to help them and not to punish, that we
                                    have given them individual rights and dignity, that this is
                                    indeed a most benevolent Occupation. I remarked at this point
                                    that, undoubtedly, clear-thinking Japanese knew that all these
                                    things were true, that this Occupation was indeed benevolent and
                                    good, particularly when compared with any other occupation known
                                    to history, but I wondered if among the masses there were not a
                                    great many Japanese who reflected less deeply and did in fact
                                    harbor resentment. When the General then reiterated his
                                    conviction that the Japanese welcomed and appreciated the
                                    Occupation and said that they knew our soldiers were here only
                                    to help them, I remarked: “But we are foreigners; our soldiers
                                    are alien troops. I find it difficult to believe that any people
                                    can welcome the presence of foreign troops over so long a
                                    period, even under the best of conditions.” I then went on to
                                    say that I had been particularly interested in the conflicting
                                    views on this subject, not only among foreign representatives,
                                    but among Americans as well, particularly among businessmen and
                                    representatives of the press, not to mention numerous Americans
                                    who resided in Japan before the war and had an intimate
                                    knowledge of Japanese ways of living and thinking. General
                                    MacArthur replied that the American press has always been
                                    antagonistic and that business interests have their own axes to
                                    grind, but that impartial observance would bear witness to the
                                    generally friendly attitude of the Japanese for the
                                    Occupation.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Walt</hi>: Having arrived in Yokohama
                                during the morning of July 23, I later telephoned for an appointment
                                with General Mac-Arthur. His Aide set the time at 6:00 p. m., but
                                called later and said that the General would like to see me at 1:15
                                p. m., if convenient. I accordingly called on the General and spent
                                approximately two hours with him. You will undoubtedly be interested
                                in some of the main points of this conversation—both from the
                                viewpoint of what I told the General and with regard to his
                                comments.</p>
                            <pb n="809" xml:id="pg_809" facs="0223"/>
                            <p>First of all, I extended the Secretary’s personal greetings to the
                                General and said that I had conveyed the latter’s invitation to the
                                Secretary for a visit to Japan, that the Secretary said this would
                                be most difficult but, if possible, would like to make such a visit
                                this fall. General MacArthur said that he appreciated how difficult
                                it is for the Secretary to leave Washington but he hopes that the
                                visit can eventuate, as United States prestige in Japan would be
                                raised immeasurably and public opinion in the entire Far East would
                                react favorably towards such an important visit.</p>
                            <p>The General asked me regarding the general attitude of the Department
                                towards the Occupation. I told the General that my principal
                                reaction could be summed up in a few words, namely, that the
                                Department is highly disappointed at the apparent failure of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to implement the Various
                                provisions of United States foreign policy as set forth in <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3. For example, I said, everyone
                                feels that the Occupation should stop attempting to operate the
                                Japanese Government; that there are too many Americans concerned
                                with the minutiae of government; and that it is high time that the
                                Occupation be placed solely on a policy level with an attendant
                                radical reduction in the number of personnel involved.</p>
                            <p>The General said that he has already given instructions regarding
                                reduction in personnel and that approximately one thousand people
                                will be off the rolls by the end of fiscal year 1951. I said that in
                                my opinion this is not enough to satisfy Washington. The General
                                then asked what the people in the State Department think would be a
                                reasonable number with which to carry on the Occupation. I said,
                                “About 200.” After a moment’s reflection the General said that he
                                saw no reason why the civilian end of the Occupation could not be
                                carried on by 200 people, provided such personnel were of
                                sufficiently high caliber and competence to act and operate on a
                                policy level. He said it took almost two and one-half years to
                                obtain a financial expert of Mr. Dodge’s standing and he therefore
                                wondered how many years it would take before he could have
                                sufficient experts capable of formulating and making policy
                                decisions. He admitted that there might be “some water which could
                                be squeezed out of the Headquarters” but, all in all, he felt that
                                with present directives (especially the nine-point economic program)
                                it would be impossible radically to reduce personnel at the present
                                time. He is, however, continuing his efforts wherever possible to
                                cut down and to take the Occupation out of operating procedures.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the purge, the General said that he could not
                                understand why Washington insists that he act contrary to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decision on this subject. I
                                explained to him the reasons, but his attitude convinced me that the
                                time was inopportune to press the subject. <pb n="810"
                                    xml:id="pg_810" facs="0224"/>(I made a mental note to return to
                                this subject when I discuss my letter to him written in the
                                Department—this letter was not mentioned.)</p>
                            <p>It was at this point that I casually mentioned the Siamese gold
                                problem and the probability that a communication of some sort on
                                this subject would be received shortly. I have already covered this
                                aspect of our conversation in my letter of July 25.</p>
                            <p>I told the General that one thought in the Department is along the
                                line of establishing a civilian deputy under the Supreme Commander,
                                with broad powers separate and distinct from the military. The
                                General immediately asked, “who would this gem of a person be?” I
                                said that Joe Dodge’s name had been mentioned but the General said
                                he was convinced in his own mind that Dodge would not accept. In any
                                event, he said that he would not be party to an arrangement whereby
                                he, General MacArthur, would be expected to sit idly by and let
                                someone else run the Occupation for him. He then spoke at length and
                                with some bitterness on the difficulties which he has had in keeping
                                high-caliber people on the job here. He mentioned several names,
                                including Dodge, as examples of what happens: the experts come to
                                Japan, recommend a plan which is set in motion, and then promptly
                                depart for the United States, leaving <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> to hold the bag. He said that the present
                                difficult economic situation in Japan is the direct result of
                                Dodge’s recommendations and that Dodge should be here to provide
                                further guidance and direction. In other words, the experts should
                                see it through, for two years if necessary.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the impact of the Occupation upon the Japanese people,
                                the General said that his statement of May 3, 1949,<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d120fn1">See text dated May 2, <ref target="#pg_743">p.
                                        743</ref>.</note> has set the pattern for a rapid return to
                                the Japanese of many functions previously directly controlled by the
                                Occupation. He said that wherever possible, jurisdiction is being
                                returned to the Japanese and that in consequence, more and more
                                authority is being assumed by the Japanese Government. He felt,
                                however, that it could not be Washington’s desire that United States
                                troop strength in Japan be further reduced and he is accordingly
                                working on the premise that the Eighth Army should gradually revert
                                to a tactical force in garrison status. He pointed out the complex
                                problem which faces United States policy in Japan by demanding on
                                the one hand that the impact of the Occupation be minimized, and on
                                the other, that strategic protection be given to United States
                                interests in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>General MacArthur apparently still feels that a treaty of peace
                                should be negotiated at the earliest possible moment with the
                                proviso, however, that United States troops remain here until such
                                time when their withdrawal becomes feasible. He realizes the dilemma
                                in which we would be placed were such a decision to be made, but
                                hopes that <pb n="811" xml:id="pg_811" facs="0225"/>efforts towards
                                a peace treaty will continue, especially as he feels that we are
                                losing the good will of the Japanese by seemingly holding out
                                against a treaty.</p>
                            <p>On the matter of sufficiency of Japanese police forces, the General
                                said that the military have been ordered to refrain from
                                interference in all cases, except when a situation has patently
                                grown out of hand. He believes that the Japanese police forces have
                                been vastly improved in discipline and morale and are fully capable
                                of handling problems which would normally fall to a police force. He
                                thinks it unreasonable to expect the Japanese police to act as a
                                constabulary as obviously they are not armed beyond pistols nor
                                trained as troops.</p>
                            <p>The General asked me whether consideration is being given to a change
                                in the regime of control of Japan. I replied that I was unable to
                                discover any definitive thought on this subject; that people in the
                                Department realize and appreciate the excellent job which he has
                                done in Japan, and that, barring a treaty of peace, I very much
                                doubted that the regime of control would be changed. On the other
                                hand, I said that the Department is strongly of the view that <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, being an officer of the United
                                States appointed by the President, is subject to orders from the
                                United States Government, and could be replaced by the President
                                without great difficulty. The General took exception to this view on
                                the ground that the Moscow Agreement specifically states that he is
                                the sole executive authority for the Allied Powers and that
                                appointment of a new <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> would be
                                subject to agreement among the major Allied Powers. I said that his
                                view does not conform with that held by the policy makers in
                                Washington. I closed this part of the discussion by recounting a
                                rumor which I had heard on fairly good authority regarding the
                                acceptance of General Clay’s resignation by the President,<note

                                    1949, p. 632.</note> presumably because of his failure to carry
                                out United States policy. This interested the General greatly and
                                later when I accompanied him to his car he said that the Clay
                                resignation was a most interesting bit of news. I particularly
                                stressed to the General the fact that my information was based on a
                                casual conversation and that I could not, of course, vouch for it.
                                The General said he believes the story and that it makes sense in
                                the light of other factors.</p>
                            <p>I told the General that I was greatly impressed by the earnestness
                                with which all levels in the Department strive to meet and reconcile
                                SCAPS’s views with realities of the situation in Washington. I
                                assured him that when his views are received they are given most
                                careful study and consideration by everyone concerned although at
                                times it is impossible to adopt his views <hi rend="italic">in
                                    toto</hi> and that compromise solutions are often the only
                                possible ones consistent with practicality.</p>
                            <pb n="812" xml:id="pg_812" facs="0226"/>
                            <p>The General seemed to be genuinely glad to welcome me back to Japan
                                and invited me to come to see him as often as I wish if there are
                                any other matters that I would like to bring to his attention. He
                                said that he is desirous of doing every thing possible to assist in
                                carrying out United States foreign policy. When I suggested to him
                                that one school of thought in the Department of the Army felt that
                                the State Department alone should formulate all policy (except
                                purely military matters) for Japan, the General said that such an
                                arrangement would be an improvement over the present confusing
                                procedure.</p>
                            <p>In summary, it is my conclusion that the General is prepared to go
                                along with the Department’s policies in most cases. He still feels
                                strongly about the purge (probably as a result of Whitney’s advice),
                                but even on this subject I have hopes of some amelioration. In my
                                meeting with him I sensed a new willingness to “play ball”, an
                                attitude which contrasts favorably with his former criticisms of the
                                Department, particularly of the working levels. While the battle is
                                far from won, I was also impressed in a later conversation by the
                                attitude of Major General E. M. Almond, Chief of Staff, regarding
                                efforts being made to cut down Occupation controls, reduce
                                personnel, eliminate evidences of military overlordship, and in
                                general to meeting the underlying philosophy of <gloss

                            <p>A–311. Reference Department’s telegram No. 98 of July 23<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d121fn1">See footnote 1 to telegram 108 of July 20, <ref

                                labor policy.</p>
                            <p>Substance of introduction and six numbered paragraphs of telegram was
                                embodied in memorandum left with External Affairs July 26.
                                Memorandum was given first examination immediately, and in course of
                                conversation External Affairs officer made extensive and quite frank
                                remarks, summary of which follows:</p>
                            <p>The Canadian Government considers that it is the function of <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> to lay down the principles which
                                shall prevail in administering the occupation of Japan. The
                                Government feels it is the function primarily of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to implement the principles laid
                                down by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, but <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> itself is to a certain extent
                                interested, beyond the mere formulation of policy principles, in
                                observing in what manner <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                effects implementation. Speaking quite frankly, the External Affairs
                                officer <pb n="813" xml:id="pg_813" facs="0227"/>said that the
                                Canadian Government feels the principles formulated by <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> have sometimes been stretched by
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. He referred to action
                                toward Japanese participation in <gloss target="#t_ITU1">ITU</gloss>
                                as a case in point (see Depcirtel March 11, 1949<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d121fn2">Not printed.</note>). With specific reference
                                to labor laws, he stated that the Canadian concept of a proper
                                long-term provision of law for Japan is that the Civil Service
                                proper should be prohibited from striking, but that this prohibition
                                should not extend to workers on Government enterprises such as
                                railways, tele-communications, etc. He implied, but did not state,
                                that this is the view initially adopted by <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> (Embassy is not informed on the point). As a
                                parallel, he cited the fact that workers of the Government-owned
                                Canadian National Railway system, as far as permanently effective
                                law is concerned, are free to strike. At the same time, he freely
                                acknowledged that a stoppage on the <gloss target="#t_CNR1"
                                    >CNR</gloss> would mortally wound the Canadian economy and
                                should a stoppage seem imminent, there is no doubt that emergency
                                action would be taken. The External Affairs officer made it clear
                                that there is no Canadian objection to provision under Japanese law
                                for similar emergency action to be taken by the Japanese Government
                                (as set out in principle in Article 5 of <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>–045/5), but he expressed the Canadian preference
                                for the principle that government workers, except Civil Service,
                                should not be barred by permanent legislation from the ultimate
                                means of effecting collective bargaining.</p>
                            <p>The External Affairs officer also pointed out that in the Canadian
                                view, healthy activity on the part of Japanese unions in general
                                would probably be beneficial to other countries, and he cited the
                                cases of pre-war Japanese industry and ocean shipping, which were
                                able to undercut foreign competition largely because of a big supply
                                of docile labor which was not in a position to see to its own
                                welfare. He felt restriction of union activities among government
                                workers should be as narrow as possible not to discourage private
                                industry unions.</p>
                            <p>Approaching another aspect of the matter, the External Affairs
                                officer reverted to his earlier statement that from the Canadian
                                point of view <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> has sometimes
                                stretched the principles laid down by <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>; and he said, speaking very frankly indeed, that to
                                the Canadians it seems to be a regular method to present a series of
                                    <hi rend="italic">faits accomplis</hi>, which have in most
                                instances been accepted by <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, and
                                by the Governments represented in <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>, either because it would be impossible from the
                                practical point of view to question the action taken, or because it
                                would be embarrassing and damaging to the prestige of the occupation
                                authorities to do so. The Canadians feel that the views of <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and of its member governments are
                                known, or could be known, in advance by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>, and they feel these views should be given more
                                consideration before initial action is taken by the occupation
                                authorities. <pb n="814" xml:id="pg_814" facs="0228"/>The External
                                Affairs officer continued by remarking that the administration of
                                Japan has turned out to be a unilateral matter. He developed his
                                theme by the statement that the Department of External Affairs would
                                consider it most desirable if Japanese affairs could be discussed
                                between Canada and the United States and views exchanged from time
                                to time in advance of action being taken, either in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> or by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>. He pointed out the benefit to both countries
                                which results from following this procedure in connection with
                                matters coming before the General Assembly of the UN, and he
                                admitted quite freely Canadian disappointment that Canada has not
                                been consulted also with respect to Japan.</p>
                            <p>The above remarks were made without regard to the existing unusual
                                and critical situation in Japan, and were an expression only of
                                general views. The danger of the present situation is appreciated by
                                the Canadian Government, and in view of it the Canadian position on
                                the present Australian resolution in <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> will be reviewed, and the Embassy will be informed
                                of the outcome.</p>
                            <p>The impression gained by the Embassy officer who left the memorandum
                                is that the feeling of Canada having been “taken for granted again”
                                (those words were used) underlies the whole Canadian position and
                                may well be the most important factor in it. With regard to the
                                particular question of the Australian resolution, it seems almost
                                certainly a more important factor than the enunciated principle that
                                only civil servants among Government workers should be deprived of
                                the right to strike.</p>

                                issued by General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied
                                Powers, to the Japanese Government (<gloss target="#t_Scapin1"
                                    >Scapin</gloss> 6693–A of July 7, 1949) authorizing Japanese
                                whaling expeditions in the Antarctic for 1949–1950 season. Japanese
                                whaling operations in the Antarctic will be conducted on a basis
                                substantially similar to that of the past season: two fleets are
                                authorized and provisions for control of the expedition are laid
                                down. The enclosed directive also instructs the Japanese Government
                                to make a survey of each vessel in the expedition which will carry
                                liquid cargo in order to insure the absence of structural
                                deficiencies.</p>

                                instruction. In this way, its distribution is considerably more
                                limited than that of ordinary Headquarters directives; for example,
                                the missions in Japan representing foreign governments do not

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Bob</hi>: For some time we have been
                                disturbed at the situation in the Ryukyus. We have felt that not
                                sufficient action was being taken to implement in all its phases the
                                applicable provisions in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3,
                                which recognize that this Government should seek to retain the
                                facilities in the Ryukyus on a long-term basis and develop them
                                accordingly. This policy also provided that “The United States
                                agencies responsible for administering the above-mentioned islands
                                should promptly formulate and carry out a program on a long-term
                                basis for the economic and social well-being and, to the extent
                                practicable, for the eventual reduction to a minimum of the deficit
                                in the economy of the natives.”</p>
                            <p>Our concern has been increased lately due to the recent severe
                                typhoon which caused serious and far reaching damage to Okinawa, as
                                well as recent indications that all is not well among the native
                                population. With respect to the latter point, you may have noticed
                                the following passage from <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                >CINCFE</gloss>’s weekly telegraphic report No. 42 of July 23:</p>

                            </quote>
                            <p>As you probably are aware, the Department in May of this year sent
                                Mr. Douglas L. Oliver, Adviser on Pacific Islands in this Office, to
                                Japan and to the Ryukyus to make a general survey. As a result of
                                the splendid cooperation Mr. Oliver received from the American
                                military authorities in Japan and in the Ryukyus he was able to see
                                and learn a great deal with respect to the problems confronting this
                                Government in that area. He has now submitted a report which is a
                                frank, straightforward statement of what he saw and his
                                recommendations <pb n="816" xml:id="pg_816" facs="0230"/>as to what
                                can and should be done. I am enclosing a copy<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d123fn1">Not printed.</note> for your personal
                                information in the hope that you will find it possible to read it,
                                notwithstanding its length. For reasons which will appear obvious to
                                you upon reading the report, I suggest that it not be circulated
                                widely and that for the present neither the report nor any excerpts
                                from it be sent to Japan or the Ryukyus. After you have had an
                                opportunity to read the report I should be glad to discuss with you
                                appropriate means of implementing those of its recommendations
                                which, after consideration between us, appear to be desirable.</p>
                            <p>However, it does seem almost self evident that Mr. Oliver’s
                                recommendation that a new directive be issued regarding the Ryukyus
                                is one that should be acted on promptly. I am therefore enclosing
                                for your consideration a copy of a proposed new United States
                                directive based on Mr. Oliver’s recommendations. It is believed that
                                such a directive, setting forth United States policies for the
                                Ryukyus in a single short document of low enough classification to
                                reach all echelons of the Military Government would go far to meet
                                the need for policy guidance in the Ryukyus and would provide a
                                basis for steady progress.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Oliver’s recommendation that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> decision to “retain” the Ryukyus be reviewed, by
                                exploring the possibilities of securing our strategic interests
                                while returning the Islands to Japan, calls for careful
                                consideration in view of its far reaching implications.</p>
                            <p>Your comments on this report and the proposed directive, as well as
                                any suggestions you may wish to make with regard to how we may
                                proceed in this important matter would be most appreciated.</p>

                                India and possibly France, favor a Japanese peace settlement as soon
                                as possible. India fears the risks involved in any U.S. withdrawal
                                from Japan at a time of rapid Communism expansion in Asia. There has
                                been no recent indication of official French thinking on the
                                subject. While the Kremlin presumably recognizes that a prolonged
                                U.S. occupation will tend increasingly to antagonize the Japanese,
                                it is possible that the present Soviet line favoring an early peace
                                settlement is based on more than propaganda designed to curry favor
                                with the Japanese. Moscow may estimate that, with China passing
                                under Communist domination, a Japan freed from occupation control
                                would be more pliable than at present to pressure from Communist
                                Asia.</p>
                            <p>As for peace treaty procedure, the U.K. and the British Commonwealth
                                countries still support the Canberra Conference decision in favor of
                                voting by a two-thirds majority of all <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> countries, none of them having the power of veto.
                                If the four Great Powers insisted on a veto, the British
                                Commonwealth would probably not object, provided a British
                                Commonwealth representative were also given the power of veto in the
                                name of Australia, New Zealand, India and Canada. In the last
                                analysis these countries might even accept the <gloss

                                in 1947. The Netherlands and France would tend to follow the lead of
                                the U.S. on this matter. The USSR might modify its present demand
                                that the treaty be initially considered by the CFM but would
                                probably insist on having the right of veto at any peace
                                conference.</p>
                            <p>The Netherlands, U.K. and Philippines appear prepared to conclude a
                                treaty with or without Soviet participation. Australia and New
                                Zealand have expressed the view that Soviet participation is
                                important. Heretofore China has been reluctant to antagonize the
                                USSR or give it a pretext for abrogating the 1945 Sino-Soviet
                                Treaty. At this stage of developments in China, the Chinese
                                Government would probably not refuse to participate in a conference
                                without the USSR.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of a peace treaty, the U.S. would presumably proceed
                                with its present policy of restoring to Japan increasing
                                responsibility over its international relations. All of the other
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries have taken the
                                view that this is a matter for the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"

                            <p>Despite Communist-inspired unrest in populous Southeast Asia and
                                despite expanding Soviet influence in Northeast Asia, Australia has
                                clung to the belief that the principal threat to its security comes
                                from a revived Japan rather than from a Communist Asia backed by the
                                Soviet Union. There has been a tendency in Australia to avoid the
                                realities of the Far Eastern situation in the knowledge that the
                                U.S. will, as before, “bail them out” of any military crisis. By the
                                same token Australia is anxious to see the U.S. military position in
                                the Western Pacific strengthened. It favors a U.S. strategic
                                trusteeship for the Bonins, the Ryukyus and perhaps for Quelpart
                                (Cheju, now held by Korea). Presumably it would not oppose U.S.
                                bases in Japan, being disposed to favor any increase of U.S.
                                commitments in the Western Pacific. If the U.S. underwrote a Pacific
                                counterpart to the North Atlantic Pact, Australia could be expected
                                to moderate its previous position demanding that Japan remain
                                completely disarmed and demilitarized for decades hence. Present
                                Australian thinking would favor treaty terms extending Allied
                                supervision over Japan in the form of an inspection of strategic
                                industries and a regulation of imports. Australian officials are
                                sympathetic to the view that reparations be relatively small.
                                Australia may be expected to propose the inclusion of treaty clauses
                                guaranteeing the perpetuation of labor reforms and the
                                decartelization of industry.</p>

                                have been more moderate in their viewpoint; and recently the Acting
                                Foreign Minister, Mr. Yeh, informed the American Embassy office in
                                    <pb n="822" xml:id="pg_822" facs="0236"/>Canton that China had
                                “revised its policy with respect to Japan” and would support
                                American policy in Japan. It would be unrealistic to suppose, on the
                                basis of Mr. Yeh’s statement, that China would give unqualified
                                support to the U.S. position at the peace conference. It would
                                demand a price for so doing, perhaps a “Pacific Pact” the terms of
                                which pledged assistance to Kuomintang China. In response to public
                                opinion and for bargaining purposes, China is likely at the peace
                                conference initially to press its claims for the Ryukyu Islands. It
                                will insist on the retention of Formosa. Chinese officials will be
                                torn between the need to follow U.S. leadership and popular
                                pressures in China for post-treaty controls, sizeable amounts of
                                reparations, and long-term guarantees of Japanese disarmament and

                            <p>India’s attitude toward Japan is largely conditioned by a desire to
                                restore its profitable pre-war trade with Japan and by a fear lest
                                Japan fall under Communist influence. It will oppose the imposition
                                of any serious or complicated post-treaty controls and will favor
                                U.S. plans for a liberal treaty settlement, especially in economic
                                matters. Indian opinion thus far has not criticized the U.S.
                                cancellation of reparations from Japan. India’s probable policy
                                toward territorial questions will be to oppose outright annexation
                                of any former Japanese territory by a Western power including the
                                USSR and to advocate extension of TRUSTCO authority over Pacific
                                Island holdings. Consistent with India’s view that Japan should be

                                proposal for limited Japanese rearmament.</p>

                            <p>The USSR has become increasingly sensitive to the possibility that
                                the U.S. intends to rearm Japan and use it as an anti-Soviet bastion
                                in the Far East. A primary objective of USSR policy now and at the
                                peace treaty will be to increase Soviet-Communist influence in Japan
                                and to prevent the U.S. from acquiring base rights or any other
                                special privileges in Japan or the Ryukyus. The USSR is likely to
                                take a literal interpretation of the Cairo, Yalta and Potsdam
                                delimitations on Japanese territory, in order to retain all the
                                Kurile Islands and to support Chinese claims, if a Chinese Communist
                                Government has been recognized, for the Ryukyus. If a Chinese
                                Communist regime has not been recognized, the USSR might suggest a
                                trusteeship arrangement over the islands in which the USSR would
                                participate or, as a propaganda gesture, the return of the islands
                                to Japan.</p>
                            <p>The USSR has good reason to avoid the imposition of severe treaty
                                terms on Japan, particularly limitations on Japanese industry.
                                Soviet espousal of such a policy would alienate Japanese opinion
                                from the USSR and might interfere with Soviet plans for building up
                                Communist East Asia. Nevertheless, for purposes of extending its
                                influence in Japan, the USSR will probably advocate continuation of
                                the purge and the maintaining of certain post-treaty controls over
                                Japan in which the USSR would actively participate.</p>

                            <p>Largely dependent on the U.S. for maintaining its security interests
                                in the Pacific, the U.K. has reason not to oppose important U.S.
                                recommendations on the peace settlement. A departure from this
                                policy may occur on questions that engage the commercial interests
                                of Britain. Thus the U.K. has favored prohibitions on Japanese
                                aircraft manufacture and long-term limitations on the speed and size
                                of Japanese ships and on its shipbuilding capacity. Largely because
                                of fear of cheap labor competition from Japan, the U.K. would
                                certainly seek ways of ensuring as far as possible the development
                                of a lasting strong trade union movement in Japan. Whereas British
                                thinking at the Canberra Conference envisaged a post-treaty Allied
                                control body in Tokyo and an Allied inspectorate system for
                                enforcing control at key points in the Japanese economic system,
                                this may no longer represent the official U.K. viewpoint. The U.K.
                                has indicated informally, but at a high official level, the support
                                of any U.S. proposal to establish bases on Japan or the Ryukyus.</p>

                            <p>Communist successes in China and Communist threats to other parts of
                                the Far East have caused a decisive shift over the past two years in
                                the positions of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> powers on
                                substantive questions affecting the treaty. In the eyes of most of
                                the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> powers, Japan is no longer
                                the principal threat to their security. This in turn has occasioned
                                a softening of their attitudes toward Japan and a tendency to
                                support in principle the main objectives of current U.S. policy
                                toward Japan. Should the U.S. be willing to assume long-term
                                responsibility for the security of the Western Pacific through a
                                “Pacific Pact” or some other security arrangement, it is not
                                impossible that the softening process now apparent would, if
                                preceded by sufficient diplomatic spadework, culminate in a
                                willingness to follow the U.S. in a conference without the USSR (and
                                Communist China, if then recognized) or to support the U.S. on all
                                major issues should the USSR and Communist China participate at
                                least initially in a conference. For different reasons and with
                                opposing intentions, the USSR has likewise moved away from the idea
                                of a harsh peace for Japan. On the basis of the foregoing
                                generalizations, it could be argued that the chances for peace
                                conference adoption of a treaty acceptable to the U.S. have
                                substantially improved since 1947.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, Communist successes in Asia have made it essential
                                to U.S. security that there be no treaty with Japan unless that
                                treaty provides for, or does not preclude, arrangements for
                                adequately protecting U.S. strategic interests in Japan, the Ryukyus
                                and elsewhere in the Western Pacific. The major objective of the
                                Soviet Union at a peace conference, however, will be precisely the
                                opposite: namely, <pb n="825" xml:id="pg_825" facs="0239"/>to
                                prevent arrangements which might perpetuate U.S. influence in Japan
                                and which might facilitate the use of Japan or the Ryukyus as a base
                                for U.S. military operations. These diametrically opposing
                                objectives would make it almost impossible for the U.S. and the USSR
                                now to agree on treaty terms.</p>

                                regarding implementation of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                13/3, that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> reiterates his
                                earlier stated position that effective modification of the purge as
                                called for by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper is
                                prevented by controlling policy decisions of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>This position has always puzzled us, as we perceive no conflict
                                between the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> provisions and the
                                passages in existing <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> decisions
                                dealing with the purge. Although I hesitate to burden you with
                                another matter in anticipation of your visit to Japan, it appears
                                that discussion between yourself and General MacArthur offers the
                                only hope of clarifying this longstanding question. As of possible
                                assistance for this purpose I am enclosing a memorandum in which all
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy provisions on the
                                purge are quoted and analyzed in relation to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> purge decisions.</p>
                            <p>For reasons which I know are already familiar to you it appears to us
                                of ever more pressing importance that modification of the purge as
                                specified in the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper be
                                carried out.</p>

                                    hold office in a trade union.”</p>
                                <p>The clear intent of this provision is to exclude from office in

                                    Japan. There was no intention through this passage in a policy
                                    decision on trade unions to freeze the purge as a whole to the
                                    language of the January 4, 1946, directive. Inclusion of the
                                    phrase, “or to subsequent purge directives”, makes this doubly
                                    clear. Representatives of the British and other <gloss

                                    still purged under any modification of the 1946 directive were
                                    prevented from holding office in trade unions. Even under a
                                    contrary interpretation, however, it would seem that this
                                    passage in the trade union paper could have reference only to
                                    eligibility for office in trade unions. Modifications of the
                                    1946 directive could be effective for all other activities.</p>

                                Japan. Pursuant to these conversations, I had a lengthy interview
                                with General MacArthur on August 15, 1949, on this subject. His
                                views and my own observations are set forth below.</p>
                            <p>General MacArthur said that he is of the opinion that the United

                                on this question, and once again invite the Far Eastern Commission
                                Powers to a peace conference for the negotiation of a treaty.
                                General MacArthur said that while it is doubtful that such a
                                conference would be successful and a treaty of peace concluded at
                                this time, even if the Soviet Union were one of the participating
                                powers, he nevertheless feels that the United States should take
                                full advantage of the attendant <pb n="831" xml:id="pg_831"
                                    facs="0245"/>play of publicity to inform Japan and the world of
                                its desire to enter into normal, peaceful relations with Japan.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the attitude of the Soviet Union, General MacArthur
                                stated that, as he views the triangular problem of the United
                                States, the Soviet Union, and Japan, he finds that both the Soviet
                                Union and ourselves have nearly identical strategic objectives in
                                Japan, namely, the United States does not wish Japan to enter the
                                Soviet orbit or to become an armed ally of the Soviet Union; the
                                Soviet Union, on the other hand, does not wish Japan to be used by
                                the United States as a base of operations against Russia. He
                                therefore concludes that it is to the mutual advantage of the United
                                States and Soviet Russia to have a disarmed Japan, neutralized by
                                common consent and guarantee of all the interested powers.</p>
                            <p>I suggested to the General, for the purpose of our discussion, the
                                concept that it might be well to have incorporated into any treaty
                                of peace which may be concluded, if feasible, a provision for United
                                States troops to remain in Japan on a garrison basis (on the premise
                                that this is necessary to carry out the terms of the treaty), the
                                period of tenure to last until Japan is admitted to membership in
                                the United Nations, withdrawal to take place immediately upon
                                Japan’s admission. The United Nations would thenceforth insure the
                                sovereignty and territorial integrity of Japan. General MacArthur
                                agreed that such a provision would place Soviet Russia in a dilemma:
                                by vetoing Japan’s admission into the United Nations, she would
                                automatically continue the garrisoning of Japan by United States
                                troops, a situation which presumably would be unpalatable to Soviet
                                Russia. It would therefore appear to be in her interests not to
                                oppose Japan’s admission to the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>I asked General MacArthur whether in his opinion Japan is ready for a
                                treaty. He replied that in so far as reform is concerned, the
                                taxation reform recommended by the Shoup Mission will complete all
                                reforms. Furthermore, he said that he is implementing <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3 as rapidly as possible, thus
                                preparing Japan for the eventual return of her sovereignty. In any
                                event, however, he estimated that it would take a minimum of two
                                years before a treaty of peace could be negotiated <hi rend="italic"
                                    >and</hi> the Occupation completely withdrawn from Japan.</p>
                            <p>General MacArthur again reverted to his previous recommendation that
                                Japan should become the responsibility of the United Nations rather
                                than the sole burden and obligation of the United States. He feels
                                that, if Japan were admitted to the United Nations, a continuation
                                of United States occupation of Japan would be unnecessary and
                                undesirable.</p>
                            <p>Above all else, General MacArthur stressed the necessity, in his
                                opinion, of the United States taking the initiative in pressing for
                                a treaty of peace, or at least in the summoning of a conference for
                                this <pb n="832" xml:id="pg_832" facs="0246"/>purpose. He feels that
                                the Soviets presently have the initiative because of Vishinsky’s
                                proposal at the last Council of Foreign Ministers and the recent
                                Japan Communist Party propaganda peace campaign. He counseled,
                                however, against any change in the present regime of control—he
                                would provide for the continuation of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> until Japan is admitted to the United Nations—on
                                the theory that to have American troops here without at least a
                                semblance of Allied authority would give the Soviets and their
                                communist stooges too good a propaganda weapon against the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>Apropos of the above conversation, while I am aware that the
                                Department is presently engaged in a restudy of Far Eastern policy,
                                I wish hereinafter to add my observations on the subject of an early
                                treaty of peace with the hope that they may be useful to the
                                Department in resolving its policy on this question.</p>

                                people have already too long been torn by a deep psychological
                                conflict between “the new”, as represented by the directives of the
                                Occupation and the Occupation itself, and “the old”, representing
                                the product of Japan’s long history, culture, and distinct way of
                                national and international life. That the Occupation will leave
                                behind much constructive and lasting work cannot be denied: the
                                insular, thoroughly nationalistic Japanese approach to internal and
                                international problems has been severely shaken and in many respects
                                shattered. But neither can it be denied that the Occupation will
                                leave many deep scars upon the Japanese national consciousness,
                                scars which cannot be healed by an undue and indefinite prolongation
                                of the dictatorial, often tactless, and sometimes slip-shod methods
                                of a military regime. To numerous Japanese the Occupation, despite
                                its benevolence and well-meaning do-goodism, represents an alien
                                substitution for Japanese militarism, bureaucracy, and social
                                cleavage. Our insistence that our way is right and the Japanese way
                                is wrong does not make sense to many Japanese who detect a latent
                                ignorance and lack of understanding of the Oriental in our endeavors
                                to impose American methods and way of life upon a people who,
                                psychologically and socially, are still living in the Middle Ages.
                                It is mistaken to say that the Japanese “resent” the Occupation.
                                While some resentment does exist in individual cases, it is more
                                correct to say that collectively the Japanese “tolerate” the
                                Occupation because it is in Japan’s self interest to allow the
                                United States to carry the burden of reconstruction, security, and
                                maintenance of internal order during this period of total defeat. If
                                the Japanese were consulted, by referendum, regarding the
                                termination of the Occupation, it is my estimate that the upper and
                                middle (business) classes would vote solidly to continue the
                                Occupation; and that the laboring and farmer classes would in <pb

                                continuation, notwithstanding the fact that these classes have, <hi
                                    rend="italic">from our point of view</hi>, gained most from the

                            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Internal Political Factor:</hi> The
                                overwhelming majority of the Japanese people are strongly
                                anti-Communist and anti-Soviet Russia. Although the Japan Communist
                                Party is well organized, led by a hard core of Moscow-trained
                                Communists, and has until recently considerably increased its
                                popularity among practically all classes of Japanese, recent
                                tactical mistakes and excesses have demonstrated to the Japanese
                                people the inherent dangers of flirting with international
                                communism. While the danger of Communist infiltration is not past
                                and will continue to be very real so long as the Japan Communist
                                Party is legally recognized and while conditions in Japan are ripe
                                for exploitation by the Communists, it is my considered estimate
                                that, left to themselves, the Japanese would react violently from
                                the present “liberalism” of the Occupation, which, in Japanese eyes,
                                protects the communists and makes possible the spread of their
                                influence and power. Part of the communist appeal to certain
                                Japanese lies in its anti-Occupation tinge—a flavor which is most
                                palatable to those Japanese who believe they have nothing to lose by
                                the withdrawal of an alien rule. This factor is important in an
                                appraisal of the Japanese picture. Educated Japanese—especially the
                                large purged Army and Navy officer class—fear communism; the lower
                                classes do not. In consequence, articulate Japanese prefer an
                                indefinite Occupation until such time as internal conditions in
                                Japan are stable, the economy has become self-supporting, and the
                                law-enforcement arm has become sufficiently strong to ensure
                                domestic tranquility, i.e., to suppress the trouble-making
                                communists. There is an unexpressed hope among these Japanese that
                                the police forces will be strengthened, an armed constabulary and
                                coast guard established, and measures permitted to outlaw the
                                trouble-makers. As United States policy already envisages the
                                establishment of a well-armed, mobile, and centrally controlled
                                police force, we have apparently preferred to take the calculated
                                risk that such a force might form the nucleus of a resurgent,
                                effective militaristic state (which under the most favorable
                                circumstances I believe to be impossible for several decades). We
                                thus ensure that the Japanese may be enabled, even though at the
                                price of some reactionism, to keep order in Japan.</p>
                            <p>On balance, it would appear that upon the withdrawal of the
                                Occupation, the Japanese would be capable of maintaining internal
                                order (provided their police forces are strengthened); that we must
                                expect a swing to the right with a partial return to reactionary
                                internal policies; and that the prevailing sentiment of the Japanese
                                articulate class would be in favor of an anti-communist, anti-Soviet
                                policy. We might also anticipate a growing suppression of the
                                communists and the eventual elimination of the Japan Communist Party
                                as a legal entity. <pb n="834" xml:id="pg_834" facs="0248"/>It would
                                nevertheless be foolhardy to assume that the Communists do not have
                                dangerous capabilities for creating difficulties for any Japanese
                                government and even, in favorable circumstances, of making a serious
                                attempt to seize power.</p>
                            <p>3. <hi rend="italic">External Political Factors:</hi> In any attempt
                                during the pre-treaty period to remove in part the shackles placed
                                upon Japan’s intercourse with foreign nations, the question
                                immediately arises whether the acceptance by any given country of
                                Japanese representation—for example, trade representatives and
                                consuls—would not be a one-way concession to the Japanese. On the
                                other hand, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> is faced with the
                                difficult problem of whether to allow foreign representatives direct
                                access to the Japanese Government with the attendant risks that such
                                permission under present conditions would entail. Similar
                                considerations arise in connection with Japan’s admission to
                                international conferences and organizations. Experience to date has
                                indicated that the United States, almost alone, has carried the
                                burden of attempting to restore some semblance of sovereignty to
                                Japan in its foreign relations, a task which will become more
                                difficult as the scope becomes broader. It therefore appears almost
                                self-evident that unless the attributes of sovereignty can be
                                restored to Japan through the negotiation of a treaty of peace,
                                there is little hope for the establishment of even semi-normal
                                relations with other countries. Without such relations, I see little
                                prospect of restoring Japanese self-confidence, self-respect, or
                                rehabilitation of Japan’s shattered international relations. Only
                                Japan can accomplish these difficult tasks—we cannot undertake them
                                for Japan. Not until the Japanese are able to maintain their own
                                establishments abroad, no matter how modest, will the people of the
                                world begin to accept the Japanese, and their trade, on an
                                unequivocal basis.</p>
                            <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Economic Factors:</hi> The future of Japan’s
                                economy is one which I view with great pessimism, shorn as is Japan
                                of all her overseas colonies and investments, overseas shipping, and
                                international banking and insurance facilities. The rapid and
                                continued rise in population, an obsolete and worn-out industrial
                                plant, insulation for almost a decade from foreign markets, loss of
                                know-how in selling techniques, and the strong if natural antipathy
                                to the acceptance of Japanese goods—all combine to temper even the
                                most rabid optimist who claims to foresee a balanced economy within
                                the near future. The Occupation, and Washington, must share part of
                                the blame for the grand-scale tinkering with Japan’s economy which
                                has taken place during the past four years. While the story is not
                                all black, it is my opinion that the sooner we stop advocating, and
                                enforcing, economic nostrums, and attempting with a woefully
                                inadequate and ill-equipped staff to conduct a highly complicated
                                economy such as is Japan’s, the more quickly will there be some
                                semblance of economic order and at least a possibility <pb n="835"
                                    xml:id="pg_835" facs="0249"/>that the woods may be seen rather
                                than the trees. While I foresee many difficulties ahead and believe
                                that continued economic assistance by the United States (perhaps
                                under an <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> principle of operation)
                                will be necessary, I nevertheless am convinced that unless and until
                                the economy of Japan is returned to the Japanese Government and
                                people, Japan will continue to be a mendicant nation ripe for
                                internal disorder and political exploitation. I therefore envisage
                                as prerequisites: a formal lifting of ceilings on peaceful industry,
                                the word “peaceful” to be broadly and liberally defined; immediate
                                resumption of Japanese overseas shipping (even in the face of
                                protests by domestic shipping interests and <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> nations); the abolition of the GARIO A type of
                                appropriation and substitution therefore of an <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>-type operation; and an immediate
                                contraction of all economic operations by <gloss target="#t_GHQ1"
                                    >GHQ</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, and return
                                of economic power to the Japanese Government. In the treaty itself
                                there should be a broad and liberal statement of economic principles
                                under which Japan would be allowed to breathe and regain a semblance
                                of economic health.</p>
                            <p>5. <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy Objectives:</hi> If we
                                may accept the proposition that United States objectives in the cold
                                war with Soviet Russia envisage a containment of the Soviets along
                                the perimeter of Soviet influence, Japan would appear to be an
                                important anchor of a line extending from Hokkaido to Scandinavia.
                                Of more localized interest is the importance of that anchor in East
                                Asia, specifically as part of the line Japan-Formosa-Philippines. In
                                discussion of this problem, it appears to me that undue emphasis is
                                in most cases placed upon the strategic importance of Japan in a
                                military sense, with the result that the political implications of
                                Japan’s importance in the anti-communist “line of containment” are
                                relegated to a minor position if not forgotten altogether. I view,
                                and I believe correctly, the line of containment first and foremost
                                as a political problem. Unless each and every link in that line is
                                in itself a politically stable unit capable of contributing its
                                share to our burden of containment, a local weakness exists which
                                jeopardizes the entire operation. As an occupied country, defeated
                                in war, economically weak, without voice in the shaping of its own
                                foreign policy, Japan, politically, is a hindrance and burden rather
                                than a healthy link in our first line of political defense in East
                                Asia. It is my view that a friendly Japan to which full sovereignty
                                has been restored can be of inestimable assistance to the United
                                States as well as to the other “free” countries of Asia. Because of
                                the self interest involved, and on the basis of my estimate
                                expressed above that the Japanese people are anti-communist and
                                anti-Soviet, it is my considered opinion that Japan will align
                                herself on the side of the Democracies. With the loss to us of
                                China, at least for the foreseeable future, it would appear wise for
                                the United States to avail herself of the political assistance which
                                a rehabilitated <pb n="836" xml:id="pg_836" facs="0250"/>and
                                sovereign Japan can offer. In the difficult problems of the Far East
                                still to be surmounted, a friendly, politically and economically
                                stable Japan may yet be the catalyst which will enable us to achieve
                                our objectives. For these reasons alone, I believe that a treaty of
                                peace should be negotiated without further delay, as time is of the
                                essence in shaping durable political alignments in the Far East.</p>

                                appears to me that the American people are wont to delude themselves
                                into believing that the United States alone is supreme in Japan and
                                that United States foreign policy objectives are, in consequence,
                                carried out in simple fashion because of this supposed supremacy. In
                                fact, the complicated regime of control of Japan makes the
                                accomplishment of United States long-term objectives difficult
                                because of the varied compromises and give-and-take solutions which
                                each major policy decision entails. There can be no straight-forward
                                and strong, publicly announced United States policy vis-à-vis Japan.
                                We are, therefore, in the invidious position of carrying the
                                political, financial, and military burdens of the Occupation, but
                                without the means directly to advance United States objectives in
                                our world-wide struggle against Soviet Russia. Scarcely any major
                                policy which we have proposed for Japan has escaped the pruning
                                knives of one or more of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                nations. We are, it seems, caught in our net of immediate post-war
                                internationalism, of relying upon multilateral efforts rather than
                                upon our own. A treaty of peace with Japan would, or should, end
                                this complex and (in Japan’s case) unworkable regime of control.
                                Japan’s relations with the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                nations would then again be restored to a bilateral basis, and
                                outstanding problems solved on a mutual basis without directly
                                involving the United States. In the post-treaty period there is no
                                apparent reason why the United States, by virtue of its great-power
                                position, should not increase its influence over Japan’s foreign
                                policy and thus align Japanese policy to parallel our own. Under the
                                present treaty less, technical state-of-war situation, this is
                                impossible.</p>

                                Representative Japanese are fearful that the United States will
                                withdraw from Japan and that such withdrawal would open wide the
                                flood-gates of Communism. They point to what happened in China, and
                                reinforce their position by saying that our military withdrawal from
                                Korea has made Soviet control of all Korea inevitable. While this
                                viewpoint is in part based upon purely military considerations and
                                on the assumption best expressed by the epigram that “One cannot
                                stop a bullet with an idea”, these Japanese observers genuinely feel
                                that so long as the United States has a military force in Japan,
                                American prestige in the Far East is maintained and Communism, at
                                least in Japan, held at bay. <pb n="837" xml:id="pg_837" facs="0251"
                                />The fear felt in Japan is based not so much upon lack of internal
                                security as upon the belief that the Communist movement in Japan
                                will be aided and fostered by subversive activities engineered and
                                controlled externally. It can, of course, be argued that Communism
                                has thrived in Japan in spite of, perhaps because of, the “American”
                                Occupation, but this does not mitigate a real concern by many
                                Japanese regarding the future, should the Occupation in fact
                                withdraw.</p>

                                would provide for the immediate withdrawal of American troops from
                                Japan, there is the danger that the United States might lose
                                considerable prestige not only in Japan, but in the Far East as a
                                whole. Such withdrawal would undoubtedly result in growing
                                uneasiness in Japan and a suspicion that the United States was
                                shirking its commitments and responsibilities in the Far East,
                                particularly in the face of the deteriorating situation in China.
                                That the communists would change their propaganda line and take full
                                advantage of our withdrawal to increase their membership and
                                influence is a foregone conclusion.</p>
                            <p>These fears have, in part, developed in consequence of irresponsible
                                public statements, chiefly by high-ranking military officers, to the
                                effect that Japan is considered the outpost of the United States
                                defense against Soviet Russia. It would therefore seem natural to
                                expect that our withdrawal would be construed as an abandonment of
                                our Far Eastern line of defense. Any withdrawal must accordingly be
                                accompanied by a serious publicity campaign to counteract the
                                thought that the United States is “writing off” Japan as we have in

                                for exploitation and seizure of control by international communism.
                                A strong nucleus of Moscow-trained communists already exists in
                                Japan and offers a ready medium of operation for the Soviets. Given
                                further centralized control and direction, it may be anticipated
                                that the Japan Communist Party will increase its covert activities
                                and make a strong bid for power at the first sign of withdrawal of
                                the Occupation. It may be expected, as from the time of withdrawal,
                                that illegal infiltration into Japan from the continent will
                                increase, a situation which is already almost out of hand, even
                                under the Occupation. In the absence of a strong police force and

                                that the Japanese could adequately cope with this problem.</p>

                                these reforms have been enacted by fiat and without taking into

                                or enact laws, with the result that age-old customs and institutions
                                have been swept aside on the theory that they are undemocratic and
                                not consistent with the American democratic way of life. Without
                                citing specific examples, of which there are many, the question
                                immediately arises whether the change to “democracy” has become
                                sufficiently deep-seated and palatable to overcome an inherent
                                desire of millions of Japanese to return to the old way of life. We
                                are thus faced with the problem of whether it is possible to draw a
                                line beyond which “reaction” should not pass, or whether to trust to
                                the basic common sense of Japan’s leaders and people in the hope
                                that a compromise solution will evolve. I definitely favor the
                                latter course, and feel that if the general principles of democracy
                                can be preserved, even in part, the Japanese should be allowed to
                                fashion their own concepts of how that democracy can be made to
                                work. We must therefore be prepared to decide the extent to which
                                Occupation-made reforms may be changed, relaxed, or abolished
                                entirely by the Japanese when they have again assumed full
                                sovereignty. We should, I believe, not become unduly alarmed at
                                changes which will take place; rather, by force of advice and
                                example should we encourage broad democratic principles to take firm
                                root. There will, of course, be criticisms by those <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> nations which now have the position
                                of enjoying authority without obligation of any kind. We should also
                                be prepared for a partial reversion in Japan to the exercise by
                                Japanese officialdom of the many minor irritants which equality with
                                the Westerner in Japan will again bring. Life in post-treaty Japan
                                will not be pleasant for Occidentals, but the country will at least
                                belong to the Japanese. In the absence of discrimination, however,
                                there would appear to be no reason why the super-extraterritoriality
                                developed under the Occupation should not be abolished.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>I have only touched upon the more important problems and
                                considerations which must be faced in reaching a decision regarding
                                the timing for a treaty of peace. The easiest course of action would
                                be to continue the present regime of control, not to force the
                                issue, and to hope that the Japanese situation will become
                                stabilized through the efforts of the Occupation and by the working
                                of time. It is my opinion, however, that the situation in the Far
                                East is such that mere negativeness or passivity will not resolve
                                the basic question of what is best for the United States. I concur
                                with General MacArthur that a courageous and strong foreign policy
                                is needed in handling the Japanese situation and that only by
                                grasping the political initiative which is available for the taking,
                                now, can we hope to stabilize a deteriorating and unbalanced
                                situation in Northeast Asia. The Japanese people, no less than all
                                peoples, desire peace, security, freedom from want and fear. The
                                fact that they have brought their present lamentable condition upon
                                themselves does not, unfortunately, decrease the need for American
                                leadership in Japanese affairs. The Japanese cannot take the
                                lead—only the United States or Soviet Russia can.</p>
                            <p>The Japanese people are tired from the demands which have been made
                                upon them during the past twelve years, first by their own leaders,
                                and then for four years by the Occupation. The struggle against the
                                almost overwhelming odds of deprivation, scarcity, uncertainty,
                                continued change, and an alien rule, forces many Japanese to view
                                further effort as futile. The word “peace” to millions of Japanese
                                connotates renewed hope, opportunity, and a chance to be left alone
                                to lead their lives in their own way. In a military and material
                                sense, <pb n="840" xml:id="pg_840" facs="0254"/>the Occupation has
                                been a success, but it is now rapidly outliving its political
                                usefulness. It may yet become an embarrassment to United States
                                objectives in the Far East. I believe it is time to leave well
                                enough alone.</p>
                            <p>I strongly recommend that the Department renew its efforts to convene
                                a conference for the purpose of negotiating a treaty of peace with
                                Japan. In consulting the officers of this Mission concerned with
                                political affairs I have found complete agreement that such a move
                                would be highly desirable. I do not see that we have anything to
                                lose, even if the conference were to founder upon the rocks of
                                procedural difficulties. On the contrary, the gain in initiative and
                                consistency of record in Far Eastern affairs would amply repay any
                                effort that might be entailed. The considerations and problems are
                                great. They will not, however, decrease in size and complexity in
                                consequence of delay.</p>

                            <p>The economic deconcentration program, as was noted in the press
                                release forwarded with this Mission’s despatch no. 533, is entering
                                its final stages insofar as proposed or final reorganization orders,
                                or releases from designation, have been transmitted to all except 11
                                of the 325 companies originally designated under the Deconcentration
                                Law. It would be inaccurate to conclude, however, as has the
                                Japanese press, that the deconcentration program is ended. Of the
                                companies ordered to reorganize into successors, only one, the Oji
                                Paper Manufacturing Company, has completed its reorganization, and
                                even in that case, the successor companies continue to occupy office

                            <p>This Mission’s despatch no. 423 forwarded a copy of a letter from
                                this Office in its capacity as Diplomatic Section, General
                                Headquarters, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, to the Chinese
                                Member of the Allied Council for Japan, which letter outlined the
                                status of the deconcentration program as of June 17, 1949. In the
                                meantime, action has been taken in all except the 11 eases noted
                                above. The latter cases will require special action on the part of
                                the Japanese Government, which action may be expected sometime this
                                autumn.</p>
                            <p>Of the 325 companies originally designated, 297 have been released
                                from designation, while 11 have received final orders for
                                reorganization, stock disposal, or the liquidation of certain
                                assets, and 6 have received similar proposed orders. Eleven of the
                                proposed and final orders may be considered as requiring
                                reorganization (though, as will be seen, the classification is open
                                to dispute); assuming that reorganization orders will also go to the
                                Japan Express Company and to the power generating and distributing
                                companies, and treating the 10 power companies as one case (they
                                were so treated for purposes of the compilation noted by the
                                Department in this Mission’s despatch no. 344), a total of 13
                                reorganizations will result from the deconcentration program.</p>

                            <p>Regarding the Department’s request for information on the status of
                                the “large banks originally designated under the deconcentration
                                law,” it should be noted that no financial institutions were so
                                designated. It is understood that at least five banks (Mitsui,
                                Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Yasuda, and Sanwa) were being considered for
                                designation when the Deconcentration Review Board arrived in Tokyo.
                                On July 30, 1948, shortly after the Board’s arrival, however, it was
                                announced that the dissolution of the Zaibatsu holding company
                                structure and the enactment of the Anti-Monopoly Law had removed any
                                necessity for reorganizing banks or insurance companies. It is known
                                that the Anti-Trust and Cartels Division, Economic and Scientific
                                Section, General Headquarters, was strongly opposed to the
                                announcement, and it was therefore, in all likelihood, as a
                                face-saving device that the financial <pb n="842" xml:id="pg_842"
                                    facs="0256"/>institutions were remanded to the Pair Trade
                                Commission for surveillance and possible further action. The banks
                                have changed their names and the insurance companies have been
                                reorganized into mutual companies, but no further action is
                                contemplated, so far as this Mission is aware.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>It cannot be said that the Deconcentration Program has been either a
                                disruptive force, or a strong force making for “industrial
                                democracy.” Certain notorious one-company industries, notably paper,
                                brewing, and iron and steel smelting and manufacturing, will of
                                course be reformed, but the electric manufacturing industry, which
                                has been dominated by three companies, is almost untouched, while
                                the orders transmitted to the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Seika Mining
                                companies do nothing to break up concentrated holdings in specific
                                mining fields, notably coal. (Major General W. F. Marquat, Chief of
                                the Economic and Scientific Section, General Headquarters, has let
                                it be known that he suspects the Japanese coal mining companies of
                                being the seat of a rising new Zaibatsu system.) Moreover, the large
                                banks and insurance companies through which the pre-war family
                                companies exercised a large measure of their control have not been
                                touched, and the Deconcentration Review Board has frowned on orders
                                aimed at preventing them from buying back into erstwhile Zaibatsu
                                holding company subsidiaries.</p>
                            <p rend="center">

                            </p>
                            <p>The Deconcentration Review Board has undoubtedly killed a large
                                number of reorganizations contemplated by the Anti-Trust and Cartels
                                Section; that fact, depending upon one’s basic assumptions and
                                predispositions, may be considered cause for praise or for blame. It
                                is noteworthy, however, that the Board has failed to act according
                                to any consistent philosophy or plan. It has released some
                                companies, such as Mitsubishi Electric, from designation, while
                                finding lesser competitors, such as the Hitachi Engineering Works,
                                to be excessive concentrations. It has occasionally rendered itself
                                open to the suspicion that it is acting on behalf of special
                                interests to promote industrial rationalization, and it has
                                frequently and unblushingly violated its own four principles, which
                                were announced with considerable flourish on September 11, 1948.</p>
                            <p>The first principle requires a prima facie case of restraint of
                                competition before a company may be found an excessive
                                concentration; several of its orders (see, for instance, the Hitachi
                                order as discussed below) can be justified only on the basis of <hi
                                    rend="italic">potential</hi> restraint of trade, or the capacity
                                to restrain trade (Mr. Walter Hutchinson of the Board has stated
                                that he knows of no way to determine such capacity). The <pb n="843"
                                    xml:id="pg_843" facs="0257"/>second principle states that
                                possession of non-related lines of business activity is not to be
                                considered sufficient evidence that the company is an excessive
                                concentration; the Board has on occasion handed down orders which
                                appear to be aimed at diversity of operations rather than at
                                predominance in any one field (see the case of the Daiken Industrial
                                Company below). It would be difficult to show that the third
                                principle, namely, that a voluntary plan need not be considered
                                authority for a final order, has or has not been observed, but it
                                may be noted that certain doubtful cases, notably that of the Tokyo
                                Shibaura Electric Company, have been criticized for slavish
                                adherence to the company’s voluntary rationalization plan. The
                                fourth principle, finally, requires that the action taken under Law
                                207 should be directly related to the facts upon which the company
                                was determined to be an excessive concentration; as will be seen in
                                the case of the Japan Dynamite Company below, however, orders handed
                                down by the Holding Company Liquidation Commission have on occasion
                                seemed to have little relevance to the basic finding of facts in the
                                case.</p>

                            <p>The scope and effectiveness of the deconcentration program, as
                                summarized above, are not impressive. It should be pointed out,
                                however, that this survey has limited itself to the administration
                                of Law no. 207 of 1947, and that other aspects of <gloss

                                dissolution of the holding companies, will be made the subject of a
                                separate report. Moreover, a number of companies have, since release
                                from designation under the Deconcentration Law, reorganized
                                themselves along the lines originally proposed by the Anti-Trust and
                                Cartels Section. The Kobe Steel Company, for instance, has broken
                                into three successors, and the Nissan Chemical Company into two.</p>
                            <p>Misgivings about the total effectiveness of the anti-trust program

                                insurance companies continues to harass small enterprises, which
                                have been notably unsuccessful in obtaining credit during recent

                                    members of the United Nations. The Department of Justice has
                                    stated that there is no legal objection to this course of
                                    action, and the Treasury Department has stated that the
                                    determination to respect the practice of earmarking is in accord
                                    with its views.</p>

                                    this Government but prefers that the Far Eastern Commission have

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to various
                                despatches regarding the Japanese taxation situation submitted in
                                recent months by this Office, and to report that the Shoup Taxation
                                Mission, which arrived in Japan about four months ago under the
                                auspices of the Department of the Army, has now completed its
                                work.</p>
                            <p>On August 26, 1949, Dr. Carl S. Shoup, Chairman of the Mission and
                                professor in the School of Business and the Graduate Faculty of
                                Political Science at Columbia University, released a summary of the
                                recommendations drawn up by the Mission. These recommendations,
                                eagerly awaited by the Japanese public and by foreigners resident in
                                Japan, are contained in the enclosed copy of a release issued at a
                                special press conference at Tokyo.<note n="1" xml:id="d131fn1">Not
                                    printed.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>As indicated in the first paragraph of the release, the
                                recommendations of the Tax Mission cover four general topics
                                including: (1) the total <pb n="847" xml:id="pg_847" facs="0261"
                                />amount of taxation assumed to be necessary for the Japanese
                                1950–51 fiscal year commencing April 1, 1950, and the proportions to
                                be raised by the national and local governments; (2) the major
                                changes in the structure of the tax system, as, for example, the
                                part of the national total that is recommended to be raised by the
                                personal income tax; (3) the changes to be made within each tax, as,
                                for instance, the way in which members of a co-living family shall
                                be treated under the income tax; and (4) some administrative
                                considerations, such as methods of inducing taxpayers to comply with
                                the law, and of allowing them to appeal against reassessments, and
                                the role, if any, that business associations should be allowed to
                                play in getting the income tax assessed and collected.</p>
                            <p>The Mission’s final report is now being printed, both in English and
                                Japanese, and an adequate number of copies of the English language
                                version will be transmitted to the Department upon release in about
                                two weeks. As stated in the enclosed summary, the report will
                                present in detail not only the recommendations, but the reasons why
                                they were reached. According to Dr. Shoup, “it is hoped that through
                                the publication of this report an intelligent discussion of the
                                Japanese tax system will develop, in the press, in national and
                                local tax offices throughout the country, in business circles, in
                                women’s organizations, and in the universities and secondary
                                schools.”</p>
                            <p>In order to give proper emphasis to the Shoup Taxation Mission’s
                                highly significant and sweeping recommendations, an officer of this
                                Mission requested Mr. L. Harold Moss, Chief, Internal Revenue
                                Division, Economic and Scientific Section, General Headquarters, to
                                comment on those recommendations. Mr. Moss, in response to whose
                                request the Taxation Mission was despatched to Japan, considers the
                                following to be among the most significant recommendations made by
                                that Mission: <list>

                                        taxpayer compliance and make effective tax enforcement

                                        Yen 5,000,000; this provision is designed to compensate for

                            <p>At the August 26 press conference, Dr. Shoup reportedly was
                                questioned by correspondents as to the effect of his recommendations
                                on the position of foreign investors in Japan. According to an
                                American correspondent, Dr. Shoup stated that “there are
                                encouragements for foreign investors to enter Japan although they
                                are general and nondiscriminatory,” and that “we hope all investors,
                                both foreign and domestic, will be encouraged by the
                                recommendations.” Dr. Shoup reportedly listed recommendations which
                                are hoped to remove objections by foreign investors to putting their
                                money into Japanese industry… under the present laws as: (1) repeal
                                of the excess profits taxes for corporations; (2) more liberal
                                treatment of stockholders in regard to taxes on dividends “in view
                                of the fact that corporations already are paying a 35 per cent tax
                                under the recommendations”; (3) revaluation of assets, allowing an
                                increase in the amount of depreciation; and (4) “technical reforms”
                                such as elimination of the 20 per cent withholding tax for aliens
                                residing in Japan.</p>
                            <p>[Here follows report on Japanese press reaction to the Shoup summary
                                of August 26.]</p>
                            <p>That General Headquarters’ officials concerned are vitally interested
                                in the Diet’s approval of the Shoup recommendations was reported by
                                an American correspondent in an article published August 28 by the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Nippon Times</hi>. According to this report,
                                “Allied Headquarters officials want the Japanese Diet to quickly
                                pass the tax reforms recommended by the Shoup Taxation Mission and
                                there may be ‘direct action’ on the part of <gloss target="#t_GHQ1"

                                    despatch.</note> High Allied officials expressed the opinion
                                that the various Japanese political parties would cooperate to see
                                the proper legislation speeded through the legislative branches, but
                                said if they did not, they would be told that such important
                                measures should not be used as ‘political footballs’ at the expense
                                of the people.” The correspondent is quoted as stating that “foreign
                                businessmen are anxiously awaiting Diet action on the
                                recommendations to see what the attitude will be toward taxing
                                foreign firms. Bad tax laws have done much to prevent the flow of
                                large quantities of foreign capital into Japan since the end of the
                                war, although it is badly needed here.”</p>
                            <p>While the recommendations made by the Shoup Mission have widely been
                                praised, save by the <hi rend="italic">Akahata</hi>, official organ
                                of the Japanese Communist Party, as being sound and essentially in
                                Japan’s best interests, some comment upon the work of the Mission
                                itself appears to be in order. In our opinion, the Shoup Mission has
                                been singularly successful, owing in large part to the competent
                                leadership afforded by Dr. Shoup as well as by the high level of
                                assistance given him by the other members of the Mission, by
                                officials of the Internal Revenue <pb n="849" xml:id="pg_849"
                                    facs="0263"/>Division, Economic and Scientific Section, and by
                                other officials in General Headquarters. Dr. Shoup himself was the
                                subject of widespread and favorable Japanese press comment, special
                                attention being devoted to his great zeal for getting at the crux of
                                the Japanese taxation problem, his unquestioned sense of fairness
                                and ability to solicit and to consider opinions from all strata of
                                Japanese society, and an ability to work in close harmony with
                                Japanese Government officials concerned with the taxation problem.
                                We consider that his work in Japan, which in a large degree serves
                                to supplement the work in the field of Japanese economic
                                stabilization done here last spring by Mr. Joseph M. Dodge,
                                financial adviser to General MacArthur, should be considered a
                                significant service for the Occupation of Japan.</p>

                                    achieved if Japan is permitted, under the guidance of <gloss

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear General MacArthur</hi>: Your letter of
                                June 16, 1949 was, as I said in my brief acknowledgment, both timely
                                and welcome. Problems of our policy in the Far East are taking a
                                large part of our thought. I have asked Ambassador Jessup, Dr.
                                Raymond Fosdick and President Case of Colgate to assist Mr.
                                Butterworth and me in a thorough review and reappraisal of our
                                actions and objectives throughout the Far East as a preparation for

                                So I was particularly happy to have your letter.</p>
                            <p>First, may I allay the concern expressed in the opening sentence of
                                your letter. You say, “I have been rather disturbed recently over
                                recurrent Washington datelined dispatches reflecting a trend of
                                thought in official circles that a change in the regime of control
                                in Japan, patterned after the plan now being implemented for the
                                United States Zone of Germany, would not only be a desirable
                                development but susceptible of accomplishment with no less
                                difficulty”.</p>
                            <p>I remember seeing some newspaper stories along these lines. But so
                                far as I know they do not reflect any trend of thought in official
                                circles—certainly not in the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>As you very correctly state, the situation in Germany was and is very
                                different from that in Japan. In Germany the country was divided
                                into four zones, in each of which the only government was that
                                provided <pb n="851" xml:id="pg_851" facs="0265"/>by the forces of
                                the occupying power. The machinery for providing central and
                                unifying control by the four military commanders broke down
                                completely. So the evolutionary process of creating a German area
                                sufficient to attempt economic recovery and a German government to
                                administer that area, under Allied control, began by the fusion of
                                the British and United States Zones; then progressed to the
                                inclusion of the French Zone; and is now coming to the creation of a
                                German government for this area. This Government must function under
                                the control of a tripartite High Commission—even then the Russian
                                Zone remains separate and inaccessible.</p>
                            <p>Japan, as you say, fortunately is united and administered by a
                                Japanese government. The regime of control is not centered in a
                                commission, but in the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.</p>
                            <p>Equally fortunately, the preeminence of United States interests has
                                been recognized and maintained in this regime of control.</p>
                            <p>The United States, as you know, can if its interests so require, veto
                                any undesirable policy proposal in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>, prevent the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                from adversely reviewing any action of the Supreme Commander for the
                                Allied Powers, and on matters of urgency issue an interim directive
                                to the Supreme Commander. The purely American as well as the
                                international character of the Supreme Commander was explicity
                                recognized in the Moscow decision which provided that the Supreme
                                Commander (or his Deputy) should be the Chairman “<hi rend="italic"
                                    >and United States member</hi>” of the Allied Council. The terms
                                of reference of the Far Eastern Commission also provide that the
                                Commission “will respect existing control machinery in Japan,
                                including the chain of command from the United States Government to
                                the Supreme Commander …”<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">Omission as
                                    indicated in the source letter.</note> This position was further
                                strengthened by the Far Eastern Commission as late as June 1947,
                                when it adopted the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan (<gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>–014/10) which provides <hi
                                    rend="italic">inter-alia</hi> that the United States alone, and
                                without the concurrence of any other government, may appoint the
                                Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. These facts taken together
                                with the recognition in the Moscow Agreement of 1945 of the broad
                                powers of the Supreme Commander as the sole executive authority for
                                the Allied Powers in Japan place the United States in a peculiarly
                                favorable position.</p>
                            <p>In a situation so different from that in Germany and so much more
                                favorable from the point of view of accomplishment of United States
                                policy, no one in a position of responsibility would, I think, find
                                developments in Germany a pattern. These newspaper stories to the
                                contrary were what newspapermen call “think pieces”—with little or
                                no stress on the “think”.</p>

                            <p>Second, what has been occupying our thoughts, as I know it has been
                                occupying yours, is to find the true path of progress toward a Japan
                                firmly attached to American interests in peace, security and freedom
                                from Communist domination in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that here there is not a dichotomy between a peace
                                treaty and occupation. Both might well be used to accomplish the
                                same purpose.</p>
                            <p>The great problem about a peace treaty is that we are not alone in
                                negotiating it. The Russians raised the matter of a Japanese treaty
                                in the Paris meeting. Their plainly stated position was that by the
                                Potsdam Agreement the Council of Foreign Ministers plus China was
                                the instrumentality required to prepare the treaty. Neither the
                                British, French nor our Government would even consider such a
                                proposal, utterly without legal foundation as it was. Whether any
                                other possible procedure, especially one which did not give the
                                United States a veto, would operate to our benefit is a moot
                                question. Perhaps the whole question of a veto is academic in view
                                of the right of every nation participating in a peace conference to
                                accept or reject any treaty drafted by the conference.</p>
                            <p>At any rate we now have this treaty question under active
                                consideration. It seems not at all improbable that it will prove
                                impossible to draft a treaty acceptable to us and to all of the
                                other interested powers. Certainly this possibility must be
                                contemplated. In this event certain very clear questions arise as to
                                our course. Before long I should like to send one of our most
                                trusted officers to discuss some of these questions with you, in the
                                highly probable event that I cannot get away from Washington myself.
                                He can bring me your views in more satisfactory detail than
                                correspondence permits.</p>
                            <p>Finally, pending a treaty, the present policy of the occupation of
                                training the Japanese to responsibility under free government by
                                giving them increasing responsibility can continue and perhaps be
                                accentuated. This, as I understand it, was the thought underlying
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3, to the formulation of
                                which you contributed so helpfully. Here, again, we in the
                                Department of State would be greatly helped by a thorough talk with
                                you. (In this connection I am conscious of a defect, without being
                                able to suggest a remedy, in the liaison with you.)</p>
                            <p>I am sorry to inflict upon you so long a letter. I have written it
                                myself to share with you personal rather than institutional
                                thoughts. Your own kindness in giving me your own reflections, as
                                well as your thoughtful invitation to come and see for myself, I
                                most deeply appreciate.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Dening opened the discussion by expressing concern over what he
                                termed the relatively minor emphasis of US foreign policy on the Far
                                East as opposed to Europe. This, he felt, stood in unhappy contrast
                                to Soviet policy which places equal emphasis on Europe, the Middle
                                East and the Far East, and is ever probing for weaknesses in the
                                Western Powers’ position in all those areas. According to Mr.
                                Dening, Mr. Bevin plans to point out frankly to the Secretary that
                                the lack of a clear US–UK Far Eastern policy is placing Mr. Bevin in
                                an increasingly difficult political position, with his parliamentary
                                critics making the most of this issue prior to probable early
                                general elections.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth agreed that US Far Eastern policy has lacked the
                                community approach of its European policy but that this has been due
                                to the vast areas involved and to the backwardness, factionalism,
                                poverty and strife among and within the countries concerned.
                                Nevertheless, he added, the sum of US aid to the Far East has been
                                formidable, even though it may suffer by comparison with Marshall
                                Plan aid wrapped up in one large conspicuous package.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening said that his Government continues to regard an early
                                Japanese treaty as essential largely because of growing Japanese
                                restiveness under the prolonged occupation and because the Japanese
                                can go on consuming dollars indefinitely without becoming any more
                                friendly to the US or capable of fending for themselves. In Mr.
                                Dening’s opinion a fresh Congress might react to this situation by a
                                refusal to appropriate adequate relief and rehabilitation funds for
                                Japan, causing the latter to seek accommodation with Communist
                                Asia.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth stated that the Department, aware of the desirability
                                of an early Japanese settlement, had taken the initiative two years
                                ago in calling a peace conference, but that a common procedural <pb
                                    n="854" xml:id="pg_854" facs="0268"/>denominator had not been
                                found. Since then, he added, Communist victories in East Asia raised
                                two questions of major substance: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Should
                                the US proceed with treaty negotiations knowing that the USSR and
                                Communist China will almost certainly reject treaty terms vital to
                                US interests? (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Would a peace treaty
                                compromise US security interests in the Western Pacific?</p>
                            <p>Referring to question (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), Mr. Dening replied
                                that notwithstanding the fact that there can be no meeting of the
                                minds between the Western Powers and the USSR on a treaty draft at
                                this time, the Western Powers should go ahead on their own, as they
                                did in Western Germany, summoning a conference with the realization
                                that the Soviets will not agree with the treaty terms of the Western
                                Powers. Referring to question (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), he felt
                                that US security interests could be guaranteed through a US–Japanese
                                bilateral pact providing for post-treaty US base facilities in Japan
                                in return for US protection of Japan; that Such an arrangement would
                                seem acceptable to the Japanese who want protection as much as they
                                do a peace settlement. Mr. Dening added that US security interests
                                in the Western Pacific might be further safeguarded by a US
                                trusteeship of the Ryukyu Islands, as recommended by the Canberra
                                Conference in 1947.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth observed that, given the quixotic attitude of
                                certainly friendly <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries,
                                the US would indeed be ill-advised to enter any peace conference
                                without the veto unless it had firm advance assurances of support
                                from friendly countries on the principal points of content the US
                                would seek in that treaty. Meanwhile, he added, the US has been
                                taking numerous steps to prepare Japan for peace treaty
                                status—clearing up property matters, reducing the size and role of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> Headquarters, stabilizing
                                the Japanese economy, and, in the face of <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> opposition, attempting to re-admit Japan gradually
                                into the world community.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening replied that he was fairly certain the Commonwealth
                                countries would have no objections to post-treaty US bases in Japan
                                and that they could be induced to accept the liberal, non-punitive
                                type of treaty which the US evidently has in mind. But, he said,
                                Whitehall shares the Commonwealths’ opposition to current US
                                piecemeal steps to do what the peace treaty should do.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth reiterated that all the steps he enumerated the US as
                                taking or attempting to take in advance of a treaty were part of the
                                treaty problem: the sooner they were cleared up, the simpler the
                                treaty negotiations would be and the easier Japan’s transition to
                                sovereign status. He ventured that a treaty concluded a year or two
                                ago without these advance steps might well have been premature. Mr.
                                Butterworth expressed some doubt that the representatives of
                                countries like the Philippines, whose hostility to Japan is
                                deep-seated, could be induced to accept a liberal draft, that
                                through fear of Japanese, <pb n="855" xml:id="pg_855" facs="0269"
                                />military resurgence they might even support the USSR and China in
                                demanding treaty provisions requiring the destruction of all
                                military installations in Japan including those which the US might
                                wish to maintain in the post-treaty period.</p>
                            <p>Asked if it is still British policy to impose treaty limitations on
                                Japanese industry and merchant shipping, Mr. Dening replied in the
                                affirmative, though Mr. Ford noted that the UK is proposing no
                                limitations on the Japanese textile industry. Mr. Dening asserted
                                that a change in UK policy on this question is possible although the
                                ministerial committee responsible would not do so unless there were
                                broad policy considerations involved such as a US proposal for a
                                peace treaty.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Allison asked whether it was Mr. Dening’s estimate that the
                                Commonwealth countries would be willing in the post-treaty period to
                                take more of Japan’s exports as a preventative against solid
                                economic and subsequent political ties between Japan and Communist
                                Asia. Mr. Dening indicated that the whole question of post-treaty
                                economic relations between Japan and Communist Asia had not been
                                fully explored in London. It was his feeling, however, that Japanese
                                exports to non-Communist areas would increase, as wartime
                                animosities abated since there are heavy demands in these areas for
                                the capital goods which Japan can most economically produce. Mr.
                                Dening did not see any point in attempting to prevent Japanese trade
                                with Communist China. He believed that the Western Powers should be
                                resigned to the bad political influence which that trade would
                                perforce have on Japan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth stated that before entering a treaty at this time—a
                                step he said he was not necessarily advocating—the US would have to
                                reckon with other questions, such as: (1) Would the US Congress
                                slash economic aid to Japan once the US occupation terminated? (2)
                                What are the dangers inherent in the conclusion of a treaty without
                                Japan’s two big neighbors participating? (3) Whether or not the USSR
                                participated in the peace conference, how could the US be assured of
                                gaining its security requirements in the treaty?</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening replied to question (1) by saying that the Congress would
                                probably continue a measure of aid to Japan as long as the US had
                                important commitments there such as base facilities. Referring to
                                question (2), he argued that the only real danger of concluding a
                                treaty without the USSR and Communist China would be Soviet
                                propaganda directed principally toward Japan. This danger seemed to
                                him largely mitigated, however, by what he termed the strong
                                dependence of Japan on the US for defense, economic aid and trade.
                                He felt that in any propaganda war over Japan the balance would be
                                “heavily” in favor of the US. As for question (3), Mr. Dening
                                contended that advance diplomatic-level conversations with friendly
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                <pb n="856" xml:id="pg_856" facs="0270"/>countries would probably
                                develop the necessary support for the main provisions the US would
                                seek in the treaty; that, having assurances of such support, the US
                                could then call a conference which the USSR could hardly refuse on
                                procedural grounds to attend; that if the USSR refused to accept the
                                will of the majority of countries present, the majority should
                                proceed with the conclusion of a treaty with Japan, on their terms,
                                without the USSR; and that, in any case, the US would actually have
                                the power of veto through its ability to refuse to ratify the
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth questioned whether the balance in the propaganda war
                                for Japan would be “heavily” on the US side, although he granted
                                that a liberal, non-punitive treaty between the democratic powers
                                and Japan would strengthen the in any such propaganda war. He also
                                questioned whether it could be fairly stated that through
                                ratification the US and other countries possess the final power of
                                veto, it being current practice in treaty-making to provide that the
                                treaty will come into effect when half (or two thirds) of the
                                participating powers ratify it.</p>
                            <p>It was generally agreed that there is no entirely satisfactory
                                formula for deciding which countries should be invited to the peace
                                conference. Mr. Dening was prone to favor the invitation of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries plus Pakistan and
                                Burma—the latter because they had applied some time ago for <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> membership. Recognizing the
                                possibility of the emergence of Indonesia and/or Indochina as
                                sovereign states, Mr. Meade considered that all countries which had
                                actually waged, not just declared, war on Japan should be asked to
                                the conference. Mr. Butterworth pointed out that this formula would
                                admit Mexico and possibly other countries having remote interests in
                                the Far East, a situation which would be resented by the Asiatics.
                                Mr. Butterworth also called attention to the probability that the
                                USSR would demand Chinese Communist participation in the peace
                                conference and that the USSR would have good propaganda material for
                                ridiculing any conference to which representatives of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">de facto</hi> government of Japan’s greatest
                                neighbor were not invited.</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question by Mr. Merchant, Mr. Dening disclosed that a
                                special Whitehall planning group had at one time worked on a
                                Japanese treaty draft but that this group had been dissolved about
                                18 months ago when treaty prospects dimmed. He indicated that his
                                Government has at present no draft treaty to discuss with the
                                US.</p>
                            <p>(The conversation turned at this point to the subject of

                            <p>A–227. A special briefing was held on September 7 at the office of
                                the Chief of Staff for Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, Commissioner General
                                for the United Kingdom in Southeast Asia. An officer of this Mission
                                attended the briefing.</p>
                            <p>A part of the morning session was devoted to the military and
                                political situation in the Far East, consisting of a Top Secret
                                presentation of latest intelligence information by Major General
                                Charles A. Willoughby, Assistant Chief of Staff, <gloss
                                    target="#t_G21">G</gloss>–2. This part of the briefing was
                                concerned entirely with Soviet and Chinese Communist capabilities in
                                the Far East, and the possibilities of communist containment by the
                                United States. Emphasis was placed upon what General Willoughby
                                described as the Main Line of resistance against communism, namely,
                                the holding of positions through the island chain of Japan, the
                                Ryukyu Islands, and the Philippines. General Willoughby included
                                Formosa within the Main Line of resistance but with the
                                qualification that its effective incorporation within this line was
                                contingent upon political factors and decisions outside the scope of
                                the Far East Command.</p>
                            <p>At the end of General Willoughby’s presentation, Mr. MacDonald raised
                                a number of questions about Formosa. He stated that he and his
                                military staff place top priority on preventing Formosa from falling
                                into communist hands, intimating that he hoped the United States and
                                Britain would reach an early and positive decision on this problem.
                                Mr. MacDonald referred several times in the ensuing discussion to
                                the strategic importance of the island from the standpoint of
                                dealing with communist expansion on the continent. In the course of
                                the discussion, General Willoughby pointed out that the Chinese
                                Communists could offer no valid claim to the island, since its
                                status is still undetermined, notwithstanding the present treatment
                                of the island as an integral part of China by the Chinese National
                                Government. General Willoughby also expressed the belief that for
                                the present at least the Chinese Communists could seize Formosa only
                                by extensive fifth column operations within the island combined with
                                external attack.</p>
                            <p>Mr. MacDonald expressed deep appreciation for the scope and character
                                of the intelligence briefing and said that it is his hope that a
                                regular exchange of information and views on the communist problem
                                in the Far East can be effected.</p>

                            <p>We have been thinking about what role Japan should play and about the
                                Peace Treaty. As far as the Treaty is concerned, procedural problems
                                are extremely difficult. If the writing of the treaty were put in
                                the Council of Foreign Ministers, it would undoubtedly get stuck and
                                in any case such a procedure would offend the other States that
                                fought the Japanese war. We cannot have a treaty written for us
                                which we have to sign or which goes into effect anyway if we don’t
                                like it. The only way out we can see is advance preparation with the
                                United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and prior agreement among us on
                                all the principal provisions. We think we should try to get together
                                through diplomatic means with the Commonwealth countries on what
                                should be in the treaty. We realize there may be difficulty with
                                Australia, but we must try to overcome it.</p>

                                a beginning on Japan, though perhaps we didn’t like it possibly
                                because he hadn’t told us enough about it in advance. He said that
                                at that time India was just on the point of leaving the Commonwealth
                                and the situation was very delicate. He said he thought that any
                                meeting with the Commonwealth countries on the subject of the
                                Japanese Peace Treaty should be held in Australia, where the Prime
                                Minister would be present, which would be much <pb n="859"

                                elsewhere. Bevin said the problem was to get the Commonwealth to
                                underwrite and agree on a treaty for Japan, acceptable to us, so the
                                United States does not need to have veto power. The forthcoming
                                November election in Australia might complicate things, but the
                                Australians have been complaining that the scheduled Commonwealth
                                Foreign Ministers meeting due Australia has not been held. Bevin
                                said he thought he could get the Commonwealth together to write the
                                basic provisions of the treaty which would be satisfactory to us. We
                                should tell the British in advance what our requirements are. After
                                some discussion it was agreed that January might be a good time for
                                the Commonwealth meeting and that meanwhile we could line up our
                                military and other elements of our Government and let Bevin know
                                what sort of treaty we wanted. Bevin then discussed the difficulties
                                which Russia would bring forward on the issue of China and what
                                government of China would take part in the talks on the treaty with
                                Japan. Naturally Russia wants a Communist government of China
                                recognized and while Russia will fight for the Council of Foreign
                                Ministers writing the treaty, they might come in for wider
                                conference of all who were in the war against Japan. Will we permit
                                the Communist government to represent China at the Peace Treaty
                                discussions and will Russia permit a Non-Communist government to
                                represent China? I asked Mr. Bevin if Russia would come to the Peace
                                Conference without veto power. Bevin said he thought they would in
                                order to seize the opportunity thereby afforded of causing trouble
                                in Asia. Russia can give away everything in Japan while the United
                                States cannot. I said we don’t want to <hi rend="italic">have</hi>
                                to agree to a treaty which Russia approves. Mr. Bevin agreed and
                                then suggested that I talk to Nehru. He pointed out that India needs
                                food, is 6 years behind on its irrigation projects, and needs our
                                help. Perhaps under the circumstances Nehru can help us on the
                                Japanese Treaty. I told Mr. Bevin that Mrs. Pandit hasn’t said what
                                Nehru will raise when he comes to Washington. Bevin then said that
                                he did not think that Nehru would go against us and reiterated that
                                there would be a meeting of the Commonwealth in January, (this time
                                he mentioned Colombo rather than Australia) and that the British
                                would need our views before then. I agreed to give them to him.</p>

                                the thoughts which had been going through our minds and which we had
                                discussed with Mr. Bevin as to a possible procedure for going
                                forward with the Japanese peace treaty, stressing the fact that
                                these were purely exploratory discussions and that nothing had been
                                or would be agreed to until, with proper staff work, it had gone to
                                the President for his approval.</p>
                            <p>I said that as a first step we were going to ask the <gloss

                                us on the essential security requirements from the United States
                                point of view and that my talk this morning was merely an
                                explanation of the reasons for that request. Mr. Early said that the
                                matter would be given prompt attention. It was understood that if we
                                wrote a letter, it would contain merely the request for advice. Mr.
                                Early thought it was unnecessary to write, but the President was
                                inclined to believe that the question might be sharpened for
                                consideration if it were reduced to writing and that it might be
                                useful to have a record of the request.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">

                                    <p>“Mr. Early has doubtless informed you of the circumstances
                                        which render our studies of the problem of a Japanese peace
                                        treaty of considerable urgency. Mr. Bevin informed Mr.
                                        Acheson during their recent conversations that if the United
                                        States Government would submit a draft of a Japanese treaty
                                        to the U.K. Government for consideration in advance of the
                                        Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Conference in January, he
                                        would, assuming the draft were acceptable to the U.K.,
                                        endeavor at the Commonwealth Conference to enlist the
                                        support of the Commonwealth Governments for the draft. To
                                        provide such a draft in time, our two Departments would
                                        probably have to agree on its provisions by mid-November, so
                                        that the draft, as approved by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                            >NSC</gloss> and the President, might be presented to
                                        the British in early December.” (711.94/10–349)</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>I reviewed our thoughts on the Japanese Peace Treaty, as I had done
                                to Bevin in a previous meeting. I said that we were in favor of
                                working out a Treaty soon, that our interests were so great in Japan
                                that we could not get ourselves in a position in which we had to
                                approve a treaty we did not like, or in which our failure to approve
                                would result in a treaty going into effect without our consent. We
                                would like help from the British and the French in laying the
                                groundwork with the Commonwealth and other countries so that there
                                would be assurance that a satisfactory treaty could be written.
                                Schuman replied that the French thought a situation should develop
                                in Japan, as it had in Germany, in which conditions approximating a
                                treaty exist, without there actually being one. I agreed, and said
                                that Japan should be allowed to send out trade representatives and
                                have more freedom internally. Butterworth said that we had been
                                trying to get Japanese representatives into various international
                                organizations, and that while most of the members seemed to agree in
                                principle, when it came down to actual admission they resisted in
                                individual cases. Perhaps the British and the French could help in
                                the Far Eastern Commission? Bevin said that the people who live near
                                the Japanese, are anxious about them. We all should give more
                                attention and thought to Japan.</p>

                            <p>In an informal conversation held on September 20, 1949 with General
                                MacArthur on the subject of a peace treaty with Japan, the General
                                said that he had completely changed his views regarding post-treaty
                                controls for Japan. He recalled that during discussions on this
                                subject some two years ago, he had in general concurred with
                                suggestions made at that time that a Council of Ambassadors,
                                Commission of Inspection, and similar bodies be formed for the
                                purpose of carrying out certain control functions in the post-treaty
                                period.</p>
                            <p>In view of the changed world situation and developments in Japan
                                since the early drafts of a proposed peace treaty, he felt that
                                above all else the substantive provisions of the treaty of peace
                                should be as simple as possible and phrased in general terminology,
                                and should be designed solely to bring about a state of peace with
                                Japan. He thought that the concept of exercising controls over Japan
                                consequent upon a peace treaty would merely result in substituting a
                                new <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> setup at a time when
                                efforts should in fact be made towards the reconstitution and
                                strengthening of Japan’s sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the General felt that the question of Japan’s
                                security is one which must be given most careful consideration. He
                                was inclined to believe that if Soviet Russia would join in an
                                absolute guarantee of non-aggression and neutrality for Japan, such
                                a guarantee would be sufficient and all troops withdrawn. When I
                                interposed a remark to the effect that possibly the Japanese would
                                not be too happy to have the Russians act as a guarantor of their
                                sovereignty and neutrality, the General said that he would not
                                envisage the continuation of any occupation should such a guarantee
                                be feasible, especially as the United Nations would become the
                                guardian of Japan. The question of strengthened police forces and
                                perhaps allowing them some light arms could be worked out at the
                                peace table. Lacking a guarantee, however, he felt that some
                                arrangement must be made to continue a protective military force in
                                Japan for the indefinite future, such force to comprise United
                                States troops. This arrangement, he felt, should be outside the
                                provisions of the main treaty itself, and might be on a bilateral
                                basis between the United States and Japan, preferably at the
                                latter’s request. While the main treaty should make no mention
                                thereof, the General said that the Way must be left open in the
                                treaty to accomplish this contingency.</p>
                            <pb n="863" xml:id="pg_863" facs="0277"/>
                            <p>On the assumption that the United States Government will in due
                                course proceed with invitations to other interested Powers to frame
                                a treaty of peace, General MacArthur said that he strongly
                                recommends that Tokyo be the situs of the conference. He suggested
                                that he, as the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, should be
                                nominated as a neutral chairman of the conference on the theory that
                                as the representative of all the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                nations, he would have the greatest influence over the participants
                                to the conference, and, at least theoretically, could be neutral in
                                conducting the proceedings. As chairman, he would not, of course, be
                                entitled to a vote in any of the proceedings. General MacArthur said
                                that his suggestion has many merits: all the records, files, and
                                experts are in Tokyo and would be available immediately upon request
                                to be consulted and heard by the conferees; the United States would
                                have an advantage in that one of its nationals would be permanent
                                chairman of the conference; <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>
                                would be able and willing to provide a full secretariat for the
                                conference; full logistic support to the conferees could be provided
                                by the United States Army and its facilities in Japan. Additionally,
                                General MacArthur said that by holding the conference in Tokyo, the
                                Japanese people would immediately become aware of what is being
                                done. He also felt that world-wide attention would be focused upon
                                the Far East as a whole and Japan in particular, and political gains
                                to the United States would be great. Finally, should the conference
                                fail, the onus for such failure would not fall upon the United
                                States as a host.</p>
                            <p>In the above connection, General MacArthur recalled that during the
                                visit to Tokyo of Dr. Evatt, the latter had suggested Tokyo as the
                                best place to hold a peace conference. At that time, he told Dr.
                                Evatt that Tokyo was not adequately equipped to handle the
                                conference in view of the crowded conditions then existing. He now
                                felt, however, that the situation has eased to the extent where it
                                would be a simple matter physically to take care of the delegations
                                and the conference in an adequate and appropriate manner.</p>
                            <p>General MacArthur said that if the United States Government were
                                agreeable to his suggestion, the proper procedure, in his opinion,
                                would be for the United States to issue invitations to the Powers
                                concerned containing these suggestions.</p>
                            <p>Arising out of the above conversation, I suggested to General
                                MacArthur the necessity for preparing the Department of State
                                Mission in Tokyo for an eventual resumption of its proper functions
                                in Japan, I pointed out that it appeared essential to me that the
                                staff of <gloss target="#t_USPolAd1">USPolAd</gloss> be gradually
                                strengthened by the addition of experienced and carefully selected
                                officers and personnel, so that it would be possible without undue
                                friction and delay for Department of State personnel to function as
                                an American Embassy here, I further said <pb n="864" xml:id="pg_864"
                                    facs="0278"/>that I envisaged the necessity for having a
                                considerably enlarged staff to carry on many of functions which are
                                now carried out by <gloss target="#t_GHQ1">GHQ</gloss>, <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, such as political negotiations;
                                economic, financial, agricultural, and labor reporting and
                                assistance; cultural and education programs (<gloss
                                    target="#t_USIE1">USIE</gloss> work); etc. General MacArthur
                                replied that, without wishing to be invidious or critical, it was
                                his opinion that the staff of <gloss target="#t_USPolAd1"
                                    >USPolAd</gloss> needs strengthening now. He said that he felt
                                that Tokyo was “at the end of the line” and perhaps for that reason
                                the Department has not seen fit to assign more experienced Foreign
                                Service officers to carry on its functions here.</p>
                            <p>With regard to increasing the effectivenss of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USPolAd1">USPolAd</gloss> staff, both in personnel
                                and numbers, General MacArthur said that he would leave the matter
                                entirely in my hands, and be guided by my recommendations. He said
                                that this is an internal Department of State matter, administrative
                                in character, and that if I now felt the necessity for building up
                                the staff here and if the Department of State agreed, he had no
                                objections whatsoever.</p>
                            <p>When it becomes apparent that a peace conference is to be convoked,
                                General MacArthur said that he would immediately give instructions
                                to have a study prepared by his staff regarding a take-over in due,
                                course by the Department of State. He said that the Department could
                                rest assured that he would do everything possible to assist in this
                                connection, and that his in opinion a take-over could at that time
                                take place “without a ripple.” He suggested that the Department of
                                State might perhaps be well advised prior to a take-over carefully
                                to select, a number of civilians presently serving as experts in
                                various <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> Sections, as such
                                civilians could most readily contribute towards proper continuity of
                                effort and in any event would be more familiar with the background
                                of the many problems which will arise in the immediate post-treaty
                                period.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the re-establishment of the American Embassy, General
                                MacArthur said that as of the date of the signing of the treaty of
                                peace, the Embassy would be ready for immediate occupancy by the;
                                senior Department of State representative in Japan.</p>

                                1948, by which the boundary of the fishing area in the waters
                                between Hokkaido and the Habomai Islands was more accurately
                                defined. By the new memorandum to the Japanese Government the
                                authorized fishing area is extended eastward from 165° east
                                longitude to 180° east longitude between 24° and 40° north latitude.
                                In addition, Japanese vessels operating within the fishing area are
                                now permitted to approach to within three miles of any land area not
                                under the present administration of the Japanese Government lying
                                within the authorized fishing area. Under <gloss target="#t_Scapin1"
                                    >Scapin</gloss> 1033 Japanese vessels were not permitted to
                                approach closer than twelve miles to any non-Japanese territory
                                within the fishing area. The only land areas presently affected by
                                the change from a twelve- to a three-mile limitation are the Ryukyu
                                and Bonin Islands.</p>
                            <p>In a statement to the press on September 21, Mr. W. C. Harrington,
                                Acting Chief of the Natural Resources Section, said that the
                                extension of the area and the reduction of the twelve-mile to a
                                three-mile limitation were authorized “in recognition of the
                                effective work being done by the Japanese Government and
                                    [fishing]<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">Brackets appear in the
                                    source despatch.</note> industry to control violations and
                                over-fishing”. The Natural Resources Section estimates that the new
                                waters added to the fishing area will produce between 60 and 70
                                million pounds of fish annually, principally albacore and tuna.
                                While this increase represents only a small percentage of Japan’s
                                annual catch, estimated at seven billion pounds, tuna and albacore
                                are classified as luxury fish which not only bring high prices in
                                the domestic market but are also suited for export.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Herrington also indicated in his statement to the press that
                                patrol craft of the newly-established Fisheries Inspection Fleet
                                will patrol the new area. He also revealed that 33 Japanese fishing
                                vessels have been seized by Chinese patrols and that two have been
                                sunk, while at least ten Japanese craft have been seized by Soviet
                                patrols. Mr. Herrington further stated that some of the Japanese
                                vessels confiscated by the Chinese were within the limits of the
                                authorized fishing area at the time of seizure (this Mission’s
                                despatches no. 553 of August 13, no. 573 of August 23, and no. 638

                            <p>The reduction of the twelve-mile limitation to three miles is based
                                in part upon the necessity to bring Japanese fishing operations
                                within the authorized area into conformity with internationally
                                accepted principles and the policy of Relaxing restrictions upon
                                Japanese activities wherever such restrictions are no longer
                                necessary. The twelve-mile limitation was originally imposed in
                                    <gloss target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss> 1033 primarily as a
                                security measure, the need for which is considered no longer to
                                exist. Moreover, the twelve mile limit as prescribed by <gloss
                                    target="#t_Scapin1">Scapin</gloss> 1033 would have constituted a

                            <p>Japanese reaction to extension of the authorized fishing area has
                                been most favorable. Five copies of editorial comment from the <hi

                                in June 1949 rejected a Japanese request for enlargement of the
                                fishing area. The present action by General Headquarters is,
                                therefore, interpreted as recognition of the efforts being made by
                                the Japanese Government and the fishing industry to prevent
                                violations of the fishing area by Japanese fishermen and to enforce
                                a sound conservation program which will prevent over-exploitation of
                                the authorized fishing grounds.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Reuchlin called at his request. He opened the conversation by
                                referring to the fact that he, as Chairman of the Far Eastern
                                Commission Steering Committee, had not called a meeting of his
                                Committee this week because there was nothing to discuss.</p>
                            <p>He continued to say that he thought the Far Eastern Commission was a
                                useless organization and that nothing could be accomplished within
                                the frame of reference of the Commission until a peace treaty with
                                Japan had been negotiated. He then asked, apparently on instruction,
                                for an indication of the direction which the conversations between
                                the Department and British officials had taken in respect to a
                                Japanese peace treaty. I replied in general terms that Mr. Bevin had
                                initiated conversations on the subject; that the British were aware
                                as we are that the present situation is unsatisfactory; that the
                                possession by certain powers of a veto will make negotiation of a
                                peace treaty very difficult; and finally, that a re-examination of
                                the prospects for a peace treaty with Japan was desirable and should
                                be undertaken immediately. I added that Mr. Bevin and the Secretary
                                were agreed that one of the most important prerequisites to the
                                successful negotiation of a peace treaty with Japan was a precise
                                understanding with all the friendly, interested powers before
                                negotiations were undertaken. I interpolated at this point that the
                                Department has considered the Dutch attitude in the Far Eastern
                                Commission far more helpful than that of certain other powers. Mr.
                                Reuchlin replied that he thought certain other powers—he cited
                                Australia—would be less difficult <pb n="868" xml:id="pg_868"

                            <p>In recapitulating the conversation, Mr. Reuchlin said he understood
                                that no immediate developments could be expected in the way of a
                                peace treaty with Japan but that serious and active consideration of
                                a new approach to that treaty was under consideration at the present
                                time.</p>

                                suggested that US Government draft a Japanese peace treaty for
                                confidential discussion with the UK Government late this November or
                                early December. Mr. Bevin further proposed that, if UK agrees with
                                the US draft, he would then undertake to enlist the support of other
                                Commonwealths to that draft at the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers
                                Conference in Ceylon in January 1950. His proposal was accepted.</p>
                            <p>Department assumes that “the meeting in the near future” mentioned in
                                Embassy’s telegram 3813 refers to the Ceylon meeting scheduled for
                                January, and trusts that Bevin is not planning to discuss treaty
                                with other Commonwealths before US and UK have agreed on a draft. To
                                do so might result in a solidifying of Commonwealth views on
                                substantive treaty matters in advance of Commonwealth consideration
                                of the US draft.</p>

                                <p>In the light of recent conversations with the British Foreign
                                    Secretary and other developments bearing on policy toward Japan,
                                    the Department of State offers the following comments on the
                                    views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding U.S. security needs
                                    in Japan (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 49):</p>
                                <p>With respect to paragraph 5 of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                        >JCS</gloss> paper, the Department of State would add that,
                                    from the political, as well as the military point of view, our
                                    essential objectives with respect to Japan are its denial to the
                                    Soviet Union and the maintenance of Japan’s orientation toward
                                    the Western powers.</p>
                                <p>The Department of State would emphasize the inter-relation
                                    between these two objectives. The denial of Japan to the USSR
                                    depends not only on the military capabilities and intentions of
                                    the U.S. but also on the attitude—the orientation—of the
                                    Japanese people. The effectiveness, cost and duration of the
                                    U.S. effort required to insure a denial of Japan to the USSR are
                                    directly affected by the attitude of the Japanese.</p>
                                <p>The Department of State does not doubt that, in the event of an
                                    overt Soviet attack on Japan in the foreseeable future—the
                                    contingency which must necessarily be foremost in the thinking
                                    of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>—the military effort
                                    of the U.S. would be the decisive factor. The Department of
                                    State believes that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                    would agree, however, that the degree of effort required of the
                                    U.S. would be radically conditioned by the orientation of the
                                    Japanese.</p>
                                <p>In the event that the present world situation continues much as
                                    at present, the denial of Japan to the USSR constitutes a
                                    problem of combatting, not overt attack and invasion, but
                                    concealed aggression. The threat to Japan in these circumstances
                                    comes from agitation, subversion and <hi rend="italic">coup
                                        d’état</hi>. The threat is that of a conspiracy inspired by
                                    the Kremlin, but conducted by Japanese. It is essentially a
                                    conspiracy from within—and whether it succeeds depends primarily
                                    on the political, economic and social health of Japan itself. It
                                    is these problems which are foremost in the thinking of the
                                    Department of State in planning U.S. policy toward Japan for the
                                    present—and the foreseeable future.</p>
                                <p>The orientation of any people toward a foreign country is a
                                    subjective political-psychological condition. It is the product
                                    of domestic political, economic and social factors, together
                                    with the nature and quality of a nation’s relations with foreign
                                    countries. This being the <pb n="872" xml:id="pg_872"
                                        facs="0286"/>case, the U.S. can neither impose nor enforce a
                                    pro-western orientation on any foreign people, including the
                                    Japanese. We can contribute to such an orientation only through
                                        (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) fostering in Japan, so far as we
                                    are able, conditions conducive to a pro-western orientation and
                                        (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) conducting our relations with
                                    Japan in such a way that, in the developing scene within Japan,
                                    we continue to be respected and, if possible, regarded with
                                    favor.</p>
                                <p>A word of caution should be advanced at this point regarding
                                    Japanese pro-western orientation. Such an orientation is, of
                                    course, our optimum objective. There are, however, many
                                    gradations between a pro-western orientation and the other
                                    extreme—an anti-U.S. and pro-Soviet attitude. The history of
                                    Japan and the ominous difficulties which lie before that country
                                    cause the Department of State to question whether this optimum
                                    objective can be realistically regarded as attainable. It is
                                    suggested that we may eventually find it necessary, through
                                    force of circumstances, to adopt the objective of a strongly
                                    nationalist, anti-Soviet Japan which we would regard without
                                    favor but as decidedly preferable to a Japan oriented toward the
                                    USSR.</p>
                                <p>In the meantime, the Department of State concurs with the opinion
                                    expressed by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in
                                    paragraph 8 of its paper that the U.S. should do everything
                                    possible in an attempt to assure a continuance and development
                                    of the present generally favorable attitude of Japan toward the
                                    West. It is also in accord with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                        >JCS</gloss> conviction that Japanese internal security is
                                    more important than ever and that Japan’s capacity for
                                    self-defense must at the proper time be developed. It shares the
                                    belief of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> that the

                                    view, the achievement of our objectives with respect to Japan
                                    are now less likely to be thwarted by proceeding promptly to a
                                    peace treaty than by continuance of the occupation regime,
                                    provided that essential U.S. military needs in Japan are assured

                                011/51, Chi member stated that he favored extension of date of
                                distribution of secured fund, but wld vote against proposal to
                                effect that distribution schedule shld be agreed upon among seven
                                countries directly concerned on grounds that such countries shld

                                    >Rep</gloss> stated that his proposal did not intend to discard
                                method of distribution specified in policy decision as it stands but
                                only to widen scope of clause so as to include other possible
                                methods. First phrase of Phil proposal wld therefore read: “The
                                secured fund shld finally be distributed among the countries herein
                                specified in accordance with the percentage mentioned above, or in

                                countries …” US Member stated he cld not agree with motion as
                                proposed at this time but cld vote on question of date alone. Comm
                                accepted last sentence Phil proposal which reads: “The secured fund

                                not later than 1 Apr 1950,” by vote of 9 in favor with 2 abstentions

                                <p>“Successive estimates have tended to modify the surplus
                                    industrial capacities in Jap considered available for
                                    distribution as reparations. We appreciate the growing anxiety
                                    on the part of the US to limit accordingly reparations removals
                                    from Jap to the minimum consistent with Jap’s peaceful
                                    needs.</p>
                                <p>“We have a good deal of sympathy for the Amer taxpayer who has to
                                    bear the burden of the cost of balancing the deficit economy of
                                    Jap for the past four years, and we feel that, if the position
                                    in Jap is as critical as has been stated in the US statement,
                                    there is a good case for allowing Jap to retain higher
                                    industrial capacities which will be devoted to production for
                                    peaceful purposes.</p>
                                <p>“We have never been actuated by a desire to suppress Jap’s
                                    standard of living to a level which will retard the attainment
                                    of the Allied objectives as set forth in the Potsdam Declaration

                                        target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. We feel that the Allies, in
                                    their own enlightened self-interest, shld waive the claims for
                                    reparations from Jap’s industrial facilities, the removal of
                                    which may jeopardize her attainment of a self-sustaining economy
                                    within a reasonable period of time and thus open up the
                                    possibility of a growing unrest and a resurgence of Jap’s
                                    militarism.</p>
                                <p>“We are at the same time anxious, like our colleagues around the
                                    table, that efforts shld be made to prevent Jap from reviving
                                    her war-making capacity. We are glad to note the assurance in
                                    the statement of the US Govt that in no circumstances such a
                                    possibility wld be allowed to materialize. In order to achieve
                                    this objective—that is to eliminate from Jap the possibility of
                                    a military resurgence—we wld like the Supreme Commander to
                                    exercise general supervision of all Jap’s industries to ensure
                                    that none is diverted to war-like purposes.</p>
                                <p>“Turning now to the economic results of the retention in Jap of
                                    her industrial capacities, we feel that steps shld be taken to
                                    ensure that Jap does not again resort to such devices as
                                    currency depreciation, exchange manipulation, excessive economic
                                    concentrations which restrict competition, or unfair labour
                                    practices to produce goods which may endanger the standard of
                                    living of her neighbours. We suggest it shld be the duty of
                                        <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to exercise the
                                    necessary supervision in the matter.</p>
                                <p>“The US Govt has suggested that Jap’s external assets in the
                                        <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> countries shld be
                                    retained by these countries. This proposal is acceptable to us
                                    and I hope it wld be acceptable to other countries as well.</p>
                                <p>“However, I wld like to raise the question of the disposition of
                                    assets in neutral countries. There is, I understand, a proposal
                                    now before the Steering Comite which will permit marshalling of
                                    Jap’s assets in some neutral countries. I notice from the draft
                                    policy of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> that there is
                                    no proposal for the disposition of such assets. I wld urge the
                                    Comm to proceed to determine the nature of the ultimate disposal
                                    of such assets as early as possible. I wld venture to suggest
                                    that such assets shld be available for distribution to the
                                    countries eligible for reparations and that concrete steps shld
                                    be taken to achieve this objective.</p>
                                <p>“Finally, I understand that the question of the disposition of
                                    Jap assets in Siam has not yet been taken up in the Comm. I wld
                                    suggest we proceed to an early examination of this matter.”</p>

                                some reason of which I am unaware for wanting it by that date.</p>
                            <p>I will be writing a commentary early next week explaining why the
                                various Articles and the key sections of the Annexes are as they
                                are. Mr. Davies has suggested that a meeting attended primarily by
                                Mr. Butterworth, Mr. Kennan and someone from the top ranks of the
                                Economic Offices be held next week to resolve points of difference
                                on major substantive issues in the draft which have developed or may
                                develop. I should think that the attached draft, after necessary
                                revisions by <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss> and <gloss
                                    target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, and a commentary should be
                                distributed to the participants before such a meeting.</p>

                                Fishing Area</p>
                            <p>Information has been obtained from a telegram (Tab A)<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d150fn2">Not attached to file copy.</note> from the
                                Commander of the Seventh Task Fleet that effective October 23 an
                                operation plan will be put into effect to patrol the Japanese
                                fishing area authorized by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>.
                                The plan provides that any attempt to violate the rights of Japanese
                                fishing vessels by any ship either in or outside of the authorized
                                area will be considered an act of piracy, and that force may be used
                                if necessary to free the Japanese fishing vessel and escort the
                                offending vessel back to Japan. It appears, from the telegram that
                                the patrol will only be in those fishing areas near <pb n="879"
                                    xml:id="pg_879" facs="0293"/>the China coast and not those
                                bordering on the Kuriles. It is believed that your attention should
                                be called to this matter as the Navy action may get us into some,
                                although probably not serious trouble. The Department was not
                                consulted in this matter.</p>
                            <p>The decision to use the US Navy as a patrol is undoubtedly the result
                                of a previous request from <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to
                                the Department of the Army for assistance in this connection. During
                                1948 and 1949 a total of 67 seizures of Japanese vessels both inside
                                and outside the authorized area by the Chinese and the Soviets has
                                been reported. The worst offenders have been the Chinese who in many
                                instances have held the vessels for operations in the civil war, and
                                who in some instances have resorted to sinking the vessels and
                                killing the crews. The Soviets have in some cases not returned the
                                vessels or crews.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. West</hi>: Reference is made to your
                                letter of June 27, 1949 in which you point out that the Department
                                of the Army is in complete agreement with General MacArthur’s
                                recommendation that the Far Eastern Commission policy decision of
                                August 15, 1946, Exercise of Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction over
                                Nationals of Members of the United Nations, be amended so that the
                                Japanese could exercise concurrent criminal jurisdiction over United
                                Nations nationals with the exception of official occupation
                                personnel and in which you furthermore request that the Department
                                of State introduce an appropriate proposal on this matter into the
                                Far Eastern Commission.</p>
                            <p>The Department of State concurs in principle with the recommendation
                                of the Department of the Army, but on the basis of present
                                information questions the advisability of establishing concurrent
                                jurisdiction on the part of Japanese and occupation courts over
                                non-excepted classes of United Nations nationals. The Department of
                                State is of the view that overlapping jurisdiction of this type
                                might lead to uncertainties in procedure and a hesitancy on the part
                                of the Japanese Government to assume fully its responsibilities.
                                Failure to establish such concurrent jurisdiction would not preclude
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> from retaining authority
                                over the extent to which the Japanese Government might exercise
                                criminal jurisdiction over United Nations nationals. The Department
                                has prepared a preliminary proposal to be submitted to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>, if concurred in by the Department
                                of the Army and <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, which
                                provides that assumption of responsibility by the Japanese courts
                                would be subject to the progressive relaxation of control <pb
                                    n="880" xml:id="pg_880" facs="0294"/>by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> in cases where these courts have not previously
                                exercised such jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>The Department also concurs in the proposal that paragraph 2 should
                                be accordingly modified to permit the Japanese to take into custody
                                those United Nations nationals over whom they may exercise criminal
                                jurisdiction, subject to the control of the occupation authorities.
                                In view of the awkwardness involved in amending the several
                                paragraphs of the policy decision, the attached preliminary
                                    proposal<note n="1" xml:id="d151fn1">Not printed.</note> has
                                been drafted in such a form that it would supersede the present
                                policy decision on the Exercise of Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction
                                over Nationals of Members of the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, the Department has redrafted the provisions of
                                the present policy decision which concern the jurisdiction of
                                Japanese courts in civil matters as follows:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    shall exercise no jurisdiction in actions brought against

                            <p>Upon receiving the concurrence of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> and the Department of the Army, the Department of

                                before submitting the proposal to the Far Eastern Commission.</p>
                            <p>The Department of State therefore requests the concurrence of the
                                Department of the Army in the attached proposal.</p>

                                <p>2. Reasons for considering the problem at this time are set forth
                                    in the letter of 8 July 1949 from the Secretary of State to the

                                    13/3, states that a final U.S. position concerning the post
                                    treaty arrangements for Japanese military security should not be
                                    formulated until the peace negotiations are upon us, and it
                                    should then be formulated in the light of the prevailing
                                    international situation and the degree of internal stability
                                    achieved in Japan, nevertheless to assist in solving the present
                                    problem it is necessary to make three basic assumptions: <list>
                                        <label>
                                            <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</label>
                                        <item>That the United States will not permit Japan to become
                                            Soviet dominated either through conquest or

                                            and the U.S.S.R., Japan will be a country occupied by
                                            U.S. forces, a friendly non-belligerent, or an active

                                        <label>
                                            <hi rend="italic">c</hi>.</label>
                                        <item>That, if there should be an enduring peace between the
                                            United States and the U.S.S.R., Japan would not be
                                            permitted to have any military establishment or primary
                                            war facilities which would constitute a threat to the
                                            security of any country.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>7. Obviously, if the United States is unwilling to take all steps
                                    necessary to satisfy the first two assumptions, Japan could go
                                    to the U.S.S.R. by default and would become a serious threat to
                                    the security of the United States and to all other non-Soviet
                                    nations. If the United States should decide not to protect
                                    Japan, then from a strategic point of view U.S. interests would
                                    best be served by seeking the closest approximation possible to
                                    a depopulated and devastated Japan. Otherwise, any Japanese
                                    potential would be available for use against the United States
                                    and our friends. However, failure to protect Japan would be
                                    illogical and such a course is not considered here.</p>
                                <p>8. An economically strong, friendly and western-oriented Japan
                                    would be of great value to the security of the United States.
                                    Consideration will need to be given to the eventual
                                    establishment of limited Japanese armed forces to maintain
                                    internal security and to assist in local defensive action in
                                    event of an emergency.</p>
                                <p>9. “Second only to U.S. security interests, economic recovery
                                    should be made the primary objective of United States policy in
                                    Japan.” The two objectives go hand in hand. As long as the
                                    United States is responsible for Japan, any deficits in its
                                    economy will ultimately be paid for in dollars by the U.S.
                                    taxpayer. Japan has been stripped of its colonies, and access
                                    has been closed to many of its nearest and best markets. Many
                                    large, fast ships are needed to reach more distant markets and
                                    sources of raw materials. Civil air transport in a modern
                                    society has become as much an essential service as rail or road
                                    transport and therefore is necessary to Japan in promoting trade
                                    and accruing foreign exchange. If a reasonable prosperity can be
                                    created, not only will the burden on the U.S. taxpayer be
                                    removed, but representative <pb n="885" xml:id="pg_885"

                                    Staff, U.S. Army, dated 9 September 1949,<note n="3"

                                    policy towards Japanese industry, in which request was made that

                                    military point of view.</p>
                                <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff perceive no objection from the military
                                    point of view to those conclusions in the staff study which
                                    contain military implications, namely, subparagraphs <hi

                                    paragraph 10. They suggest, however, that in implementing these
                                    conclusions appropriate safeguards be established to preclude
                                    any possibility of the restrictions, when enforced, jeopardizing

                                    itself to the anti-labor measures already adopted. It is known,
                                    for instance, that by means of mass discharges of workers the
                                    Jap auths are removing from enterprises and institutions first
                                    of all leaders and active members of trade unions. Thus, for
                                    example, under the disguise of reducing the public payroll there
                                    were dismissed the progressive leaders of the railway workers

                                    Forestry Union and other trade unions of Govt workers. On Sep 17
                                    the Jap Govt published a new decision according to which the

                                Islands in the southern Kuril chain and the Habomai and Shikotan

                            <p>In a communication to this Mission dated October 1, 1949, the Natural
                                Resources Section has initiated action on the proposed northern
                                extension as described in this Mission’s despatch under reference. A
                                copy of the Natural Resources Section’s communication of October 1,
                                together with its enclosures consisting of a draft memorandum to the
                                Chief of Staff and a draft letter to the Soviet Member, Allied
                                Council for Japan, are enclosed.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2"
                                    >Enclosures not printed.</note> There is also enclosed a copy of
                                this Mission’s reply in its capacity as Diplomatic Section, General
                                Headquarters, to the communication of the Natural Resources Section
                                of October 1. In this Mission’s reply it is pointed out that the
                                northern extension, notwithstanding the likelihood of Soviet
                                objection, appears desirable in order to place on record the fact
                                that <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> does not regard the
                                present boundary of the fishing area in the vicinity of Hokkaido and
                                Kuril Islands as a permanent boundary. This Mission, however, is
                                withholding concurrence on the present proposal for a northern
                                extension of the fishing area until the Department’s views on the
                                problem are known. It would be appreciated, therefore, if the
                                Department would advise this Mission of its position as soon as may
                                be practicable since the Natural Resources Section has expressed its
                                desire to take up the proposed northern extension of the fishing
                                area at the earliest possible date.<note n="3" xml:id="d157fn3">In

                            <p>General Magruder, deputy to Mr. Voorhees for the Japanese peace
                                treaty project, Colonel Babcock, Colonel Wagstaff, and Colonel Dixon
                                called for the purpose of meeting Mr. Butterworth and members of
                                    <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> working on the treaty. General
                                Magruder suggested that Colonel Babcock, who had arrived a week or
                                so ago as General MacArthur’s personal representative to assist in
                                the treaty preparations, outline General MacArthur’s views on the
                                treaty problem. Explaining that his remarks would be based on a
                                number of conversations which he had had with General MacArthur
                                regarding the treaty just before his departure from Tokyo, Colonel
                                Babcock summarized General MacArthur’s views as follows:</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">1. <hi rend="italic">Timing and Procedures</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>General MacArthur considers the treaty long overdue. He had wanted a
                                treaty as early as 1947 but had not been too disappointed when we
                                failed to achieve one at that time, the occupation having then
                                lasted less than two years. It has now lasted four and a half years,
                                however, and he believes it of the greatest importance that a treaty
                                now be concluded.</p>
                            <p>General MacArthur fully approves the method for going forward with a
                                peace treaty by endeavoring first to work out agreement with the
                                British and other Commonwealth Governments. He thinks it important
                                that voting at the peace conference be by two-thirds majority,
                                preserving a democratic flavor, but that we must make certain,
                                through prior commitments, that such a voting procedure does not
                                prevent us from securing our essential requirements. He naturally
                                considers procedural questions of this sort outside his field of
                                competence or responsibility.</p>
                            <pb n="891" xml:id="pg_891" facs="0305"/>
                            <p>General MacArthur believes that a real effort should be made to
                                secure the Soviet Union’s participation in the treaty. He feels that
                                the Soviets have been considerably disturbed by their inability to
                                influence the course of the occupation and that they strongly desire
                                a treaty. He does not consider that we should sacrifice any of our
                                desiderata to obtain Soviet participation. His point is simply that
                                we should make a real effort to secure their participation and not
                                merely a gesture.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Neutrality</hi>—General MacArthur believes that
                                unarmed neutrality, guaranteed by the great Powers, is from every
                                point of view Japan’s most desirable course. Japan has renounced the
                                right to bear arms in its new Constitution and General MacArthur
                                considers that it would be highly undesirable for the Allies to
                                require or suggest in the treaty that Japan should abandon this
                                position. The result would be to confuse the Japanese and to put
                                them in doubt regarding our entire reform program. General MacArthur
                                fully recognizes, however, that a Soviet guarantee of Japanese
                                neutrality could not now be relied upon, and that this will remain
                                the case until the Soviets undergo a basic change of heart. Although
                                he accordingly does not consider disarmed neutrality under a system
                                of great Power guarantees to be a practical solution to Japan’s
                                security problem at the present time, he continues to regard it as
                                the optimum long-run solution when world conditions permit.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">3. <hi rend="italic">Basic Strategic Concept</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>With disarmed neutrality under a system of guarantees impractical for
                                an indefinite period, General MacArthur’s basic strategic concept is
                                for the U.S. to retain naval and air bases in Japan after a treaty
                                for the primary purpose of making it unmistakably clear to the USSR
                                that aggression against Japan will mean all-out war with the United
                                States. He does not believe it necessary or advisable to supplement
                                these bases with Japanese defense forces. If it is made clear that
                                the result would be war with the U.S., General MacArthur believes
                                there is little chance of the Soviets undertaking a local attack on
                                Japan. If, on the other hand, the Soviets on the basis of their
                                over-all strategic plans deliberately launch a general world war,
                                any Japanese defense forces which might have been authorized would,
                                in his view, be of almost negligible military value in denying Japan
                                to the Soviets.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Babcock did not make clear whether General MacArthur believed
                                that U.S. military strength in Japan should be maintained at a level
                                which might offer some hope of holding Japan for the U.S. in the
                                event of a general war. He did indicate, however, that under General
                                MacArthur’s concept the U.S. would keep itself free to add to its
                                military strength in Japan after the treaty to any extent it
                                considered necessary and desirable.</p>

                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">U.S.–Japan Military Agreement</hi>—Colonel Babcock
                                stated that General MacArthur believes that arrangements for U.S.
                                bases in Japan after the treaty should be arrived at by negotiation
                                on an equal basis with the Japanese, and should be incorporated in a
                                separate U.S.–Japan agreement which would come into force
                                simultaneously with the coming into force of the treaty. The latter
                                document would leave the U.S. and Japan free to conclude such an
                                agreement. The base areas, defined in the agreement, would be
                                located at points of maximum strategic advantage and would be
                                secured by the requisite number of U.S. forces. The bases would be
                                self-supporting on a pay-as-you-go relationship with the Japanese,
                                although the Japanese Government would be obligated to provide our
                                forces, after proper payment, with resources required for the bases’
                                proper functioning. General MacArthur’s thought has been that the
                                present occupation forces would be gradually reduced until at the
                                time of coming into force of the treaty all surplus forces would
                                have been withdrawn and the forces remaining would be established in
                                the prescribed base areas. Asked how the number of our forces in
                                Japan after the treaty might compare with the present number,
                                Colonel Babcock stated that he had raised this question with General
                                MacArthur but that the General had not attempted an estimate and
                                thought the question should be determined by the Joint Chiefs of
                                Staff in light of our over-all strategic planning.</p>
                            <p>Although he had not discussed the point with General MacArthur,
                                Colonel Babcock stated that the State Department position that U.S.
                                forces retained in Japan after a treaty should be stationed in
                                “remote” areas was unrealistic from a military point of view. He
                                agreed with the State Department, and he was confident that General
                                MacArthur also agreed, that our forces should not be scattered
                                throughout Japan as at present. It was necessary, however, that they
                                be adjacent to the base areas which they were assigned to protect,
                                and these base areas were for military reasons usually near though
                                not actually within population centers. The forces would have
                                dependents with them, but Colonel Babcock did not think this would
                                present a problem considering that all U.S. personnel would live in
                                the base areas and that the burden of supporting them would not fall
                                on the Japanese economy.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Japanese Defense Forces</hi>—General MacArthur’s
                                opposition to the establishment of Japanese defense forces is based
                                not only on the above-mentioned Constitutional provision and on his
                                belief that such forces would serve no useful military purpose, but
                                also on the fact that Japan will for some time to come be unable to
                                afford their cost. Colonel Babcock stated that in his discussions
                                with General MacArthur the General had made no reference to
                                authorization of defense forces even at some future period. He
                                believed, however, that General <pb n="893" xml:id="pg_893"
                                    facs="0307"/>MacArthur would probably approve a treaty provision
                                calling for reexamination of Japan’s security position five or ten
                                years after the treaty. The General considers it important if and
                                when the Japanese are permitted an army that it not be run by the
                                “old crowd” and in the old way but that, as Colonel Babcock put it,
                                it be a “democratic army.” Colonel Babcock stated that although some
                                Japanese undoubtedly desire the reactivation of Japanese defense
                                forces, most are at present thoroughly disillusioned with military
                                methods and actively support a course of continued disarmament for
                                Japan. He was confident that the great majority of Japanese would
                                welcome a U.S.–Japan agreement providing for the retention of U.S.
                                forces in Japan after the treaty.</p>

                            <p>General MacArthur believes that the Japanese should be permitted in
                                the treaty to develop a constabulary armed with rifles and machine
                                guns and other comparable equipment to enable the Japanese
                                Government to deal with Communist or other internal attacks. He
                                believes they should also be permitted an adequate coast guard. The
                                treaty, in his view, should contain no reference to Japanese civil
                                police forces, leaving the Japanese free to establish these forces
                                at any strength they think wise.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>General MacArthur believes that the treaty should impose no
                                restrictions on industries not exclusively devoted to the production
                                of armaments, so that Japan may have the largest possible
                                opportunity to develop its peaceful economy. He does believe,
                                however, that Japan should not be permitted civil aviation
                                activities nor the right to manufacture aircraft. He feels that
                                Japan should be permitted to develop its merchant shipping and
                                merchant shipbuilding industries without limit as an important
                                source of foreign exchange.</p>

                            <p>It is General MacArthur’s view that with Japan forbidden an army,
                                navy, and air force, and with the retention of U.S. bases in Japan,
                                any major violations of the treaty’s disarmament provisions would be
                                apparent without need for a post-treaty inspection system within
                                Japan.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">7. <hi rend="italic">The Reforms</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>General MacArthur believes that the various reforms introduced under
                                the occupation have now won sufficient popular support so that they
                                can be expected for the most part to stand on their own feet. In his
                                opinion the treaty should either require the Japanese to preserve
                                all the reforms or should make no mention of them at all. If the
                                second course is followed, however, he believes it should be made
                                clear to the <pb n="894" xml:id="pg_894" facs="0308"/>Japanese that
                                the Allies approve what has been done, so that the Japanese do not
                                gain the impression that we are repudiating the reforms.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">8. <hi rend="italic">Formosa</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>General MacArthur considers it of the greatest importance that
                                Formosa not fall under Communist control. He does not believe it
                                essential that we control the island, but believes that “by hook or
                                by crook” we must keep it out of Communist hands. When Mr.
                                Butterworth observed that this view was widely shared but that the
                                “hook or crook” was difficult to devise, Colonel Babcock stated that
                                General MacArthur had no suggestions on this point. The General
                                thought that, rather than permit Formosa to go to the Communists, it
                                would be better to return it to Japan. He remains of the view that
                                we should retain the Ryukyus as another essential link in the
                                offshore island chain. Colonel Babcock mentioned that General
                                MacArthur agreed with the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>

                            <p>General Magruder indicated briefly that he and certain others in the
                                Pentagon did not share General MacArthur’s view that reactivation of
                                Japanese defense forces at this time was unnecessary and
                                undesirable. This school of thought holds that Japanese ground
                                forces could be of military value in the defense of Japan, and that
                                their establishment would release U.S. forces for service in other
                                areas where they would be badly needed in the event of war.</p>
                            <p>In closing his remarks, Colonel Babcock stated that the views which
                                he had expressed were General MacArthur’s personal opinions, and
                                that although he was confident that these opinions would be
                                considered, the decision as to U.S. security requirements in a
                                Japanese peace treaty would of course be determined by the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth thanked General Magruder and Colonel Babcock and
                                stated that the State Department’s present thinking corresponded
                                closely with General MacArthur’s.</p>

                                question has focused its attention on two aspects overall problem:
                                First dealing with Jap’s attendance at internatl mtgs and second
                                concerning estab Jap overseas offices charged with trade promotion
                                and other affairs. Without in any way minimizing importance which US
                                attaches to first aspect, US wishes to emphasize urgency taking
                                early steps establish Jap overseas offices.</p>
                            <p>Benefits which accrue to a country’s internatl trade by maintenance
                                trade offices in other countries are too well known to need
                                repeating. Additionally, in countries where there are large
                                populations there is pressing need for some Jap agency handling
                                civil status and other functions undertaken on practical basis for
                                its natls resident those areas. Lack of competent Jap authorities to
                                perform notarial services on behalf of countrymen abroad and advise
                                them in matters Jap domestic law is confusing legal rights and
                                depriving many persons of citizenship rights and property. Overseas
                                offices wld also serve as agency for bringing to attention Jap

                                immediately concerned. Precise scope of activity overseas offices
                                wld presumably have to be worked out on bilateral basis through
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> between Jap and other
                                country concerned.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> has recently suggested to US
                                Govt that it enter into arrangements with Jap Govt, through <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, for establishing Jap offices in

                                    >SCAP</gloss> added that if requests shld be received from other
                                countries for establishing similar Jap offices <gloss

                            <p>US Govt therefore urges other <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                countries join in course of action designed improve facilities for

                                US, for reasons cited above, believes it must shortly respond

                            <p>Reply: Under Law No. 126 enacted by the Japanese National Diet in May
                                1949 in implementation of the economic stabilization program, which
                                calls for rationalization of government employment in the interest
                                of efficiency and economy, ceilings were established on the total
                                personnel strength of Japanese governmental agencies which required
                                a reduction of some 20 percent overall, resulting in the release,
                                during the summer months, of about 10 percent of the personnel
                                actually on the regular government payroll. In the execution of this
                                program such pertinent factors as the employees’ seniority, Work
                                record, efficiency, attendance, and attitude toward their jobs all
                                were weighed. It may be assumed that persons with records of
                                frequent absence from their posts, nonattendance to duties or
                                obstructionist and disloyal tactics were among those discharged.
                                Some of these persons may have been active union members, but that
                                certainly was not the criterion for discharge.</p>

                            </quote>
                            <p>Reply: This obviously refers to Rule No. 17–4 of the National
                                Personnel Authority issued on 19 September. No “new decision” is
                                involved at all, nor are the workers of “public utility enterprises
                                and institutions” affected by this rule, which applies only to
                                government <pb n="898" xml:id="pg_898" facs="0312"/>civil service
                                employees, the conditions of whose employment are governed by the
                                National Public Service Law as enacted in 1947 and amended in 1948.
                                Article 102 of this law states, “personnel shall not solicit or
                                receive, or be in any manner concerned in soliciting or receiving,
                                any subscription or other benefit for any political party of
                                political purposes or engage in any political activity as defined by
                                the rules of the authority other than to exercise the right to
                                vote”. Thus, the decision to exclude civil servants from active
                                participation in partisan political activity was made by the
                                people’s elected representatives in the Diet many months ago. In
                                Rule No. 17–4 the National Personnel Authority merely carries out
                                its statutory duty to define for administrative purposes the meaning
                                of “political activity”.</p>
                            <p>The constitutional basis for both the law and the rule may be found
                                in Article 15 of the Constitution of Japan which states in part,
                                “all public servants are servants of the whole community and not of
                                any group thereof”. With the possible exception of the USSR where it
                                is understood participation in political activity is directed under
                                the totalitarian political concept, the prohibition against active
                                participation in politics by civil servants is long-established and
                                generally recognized in the US and other democratic countries. This
                                is, of course, both necessary and beneficial, not only in the
                                interest of good government but for the protection of civil service
                                employees against pressure to work for or contribute to the support
                                of special groups whether in or out of the government. Its
                                constitutionality has been sustained whenever challenged in the
                                courts. This prohibition thus provides a safeguard against the
                                re-emergence in Japan of a totalitarian political machine.</p>

                                given, careful study and consideration to the November 2 draft
                                treaty forwarded under cover of your letter November 4, minus
                                chapter 5 reserved for security provisions. General MacArthur

                                        light of the bitterness which would be aroused if provision
                                        is made for the partial recovery from Japan for losses
                                        sustained by United Nations nationals resulting from damage
                                        to property in Japan, while losses sustained by United
                                        Nations nationals in areas occupied by the Japanese or in
                                        areas of the former Japanese empire to be ceded to other
                                        nations under terms of the treaty are excepted from claim or
                                        recovery. That such provisions are entirely inconsistent
                                        with the intent and effect of Articles 31, 32 and 36 of the
                                        treaty draft and could not fail to be challenged as a move
                                        designed to afford special protection to British and
                                        American investments in Japan, providing the Soviet and a
                                        Communist China with a major propaganda advantage. That the
                                        imposition of such a burden upon Japan would most seriously
                                        impair the chance for her economic rehabilitation and
                                        thereby eventually confront the American people with the
                                        possibility of having to assume this financial burden either
                                        directly or indirectly.</item>

                                    <item>Article 41, paragraph 3 is considered unrealistic for the
                                        reasons not only that the Japanese economy most probably
                                        could not stand the tremendous drain consequent upon
                                        compensation for Japanese assets abroad, but also because it

                            <p>I fully concur with General MacArthur’s observations set forth in <hi

                                detail and on an article by article basis,<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d162fn1">Despatch No. 806, November 19, not
                                    printed.</note> I believe it might be helpful to give our
                                tentative reactions: While the mission is agreed that it would be
                                preferable to have a shorter treaty with less emphasis upon
                                technical matters, we feel that to a large extent the problem is one
                                that must be solved in consequence of the needs, desires and
                                recommendations of the many Washington agencies concerned, as well
                                as with a view to presenting an acceptable draft to our Allies. On
                                the other hand, we are somewhat concerned that the November 2 draft
                                seemingly represents the maximum conditions which the United States
                                seeks to place upon Japan, and that it leaves little room for
                                bargaining purposes should a “harder” treaty be desired by our
                                Allies. We are, of course, fully aware that the security provisions
                                have not yet been formulated and that revisions of fundamental
                                provisions in the draft may be affected thereby.</p>
                            <p>The following are our preliminary comments concerning those
                                provisions which we consider of high importance:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>Article 5, paragraph 2: Japan will unquestionably advance strong
                                    claim to Etorofu, Kunashiri, Habomai, and Shikotan. Believe
                                    United States should support such claim and due allowance made

                                    (Take-shima). Japan’s claim to these islands is old and appears

                            <p>You may wish to keep in mind the possibility that Australia may try
                                to obtain a US security guarantee in return for concurring generally
                                in the substance of our proposals for a Japanese peace
                                settlement.</p>
                            <p>That Australia may try to obtain a price for its concurrence is
                                suggested by Australia’s general attitude toward Pacific questions
                                since 1945. Dening’s discussion of the Japanese peace settlement at
                                Canberra following the recent Singapore conference and the
                                circulation of rumors that the peace conference will meet in
                                Canberra are all straws in the wind. That Australia may seek a
                                security guarantee is suggested by Australia’s emphasis in the past
                                on the dangers of a resurgent Japan as a reason for opposing
                                proposals directed toward Japan’s economic recovery or the
                                improvement of Japan’s international status.</p>
                            <p>The guarantee sought, while ostensibly directed against Japan and
                                inspired by Australia’s narrow escape from Japanese invasion in
                                World War II, would under existing conditions be in fact directed
                                against attack by the USSR, directly or indirectly.</p>
                            <p>An Australian request would attract requests from the Philippines,
                                Korea and other quarters and revive discussion of a possible Pacific
                                Pact modeled on the Atlantic Pact.</p>
                            <p>There are strong reasons against undertaking a general security
                                guarantee in the Pacific either through a Pacific Pact or
                                independent of such a pact. We cannot give extensive additional
                                military commitments without seriously diluting the effectiveness of
                                those already given. Such commitments moreover reduce the
                                flexibility of our foreign policy. The USSR operating both in
                                European and Far Eastern areas is in position to take advantage of
                                loss of policy maneuverability on our part through an over-extension
                                of commitments. A US guarantee would also be likely to retard
                                assumption of reasonable defense responsibilities by Australia and
                                other states in position to contribute substantially.</p>
                            <p>There are also strong reasons against extending US security
                                guarantees through a Pacific pact especially during the formative
                                period of a Pacific association of states. The association would be
                                transformed <pb n="902" xml:id="pg_902" facs="0316"/>from an organ
                                for political, economic and social cooperation—as now
                                contemplated—into an anti-Communist alliance. Such an alliance at
                                the present moment would almost certainly be unacceptable to India,
                                Burma and Indonesia and probably some other states. The effect of a
                                US security guarantee would accordingly be divisive rather than
                                cohesive.</p>
                            <p>There is, of course, serious question whether the Pacific states
                                concerned will be able to build and maintain an effective union even
                                for the limited purposes now under contemplation. If, however, we
                                are now to assume failure on their part in advance and to consider
                                building up a restricted union on a defensive basis among Korea,
                                Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand with a few
                                possible additions, we must face the implication that these are the
                                states we intend to defend and that the rest are being abandoned. I
                                do not believe that the time has come when we should draw such a
                                dividing line in the Pacific, even if we had the disposable forces
                                to back a guarantee.</p>
                            <p>For the above reasons I feel that we should not accede to any request
                                from Australia at this time to provide a security guarantee.</p>
                            <p>The problem is, of course, complicated by the probability that no
                                effective UN forces will be available in the foreseeable future. We
                                have, however, made our defensive intent clear by bases in Japan,
                                Okinawa, and the Philippines and by the extension of aid in various
                                forms to other areas, without being tied by security
                                commitments.</p>
                            <p>We might accordingly meet the Australian request under present
                                conditions by taking the position that so long as we retain bases in
                                Japan, there need be no fear of Japan’s military resurgence or
                                Soviet occupation of Japan; that at such time as we withdraw our
                                forces from Japan, the security problem so far as it relates to
                                Japan will naturally be reconsidered; and that the security problem
                                so far as it relates to the Pacific area generally is a separate
                                issue not involved in the Japanese peace settlement.</p>

                                for your memorandum of October 21 setting forth the policy of the

                                bring U.S. policy proposals in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss> and, to the largest possible extent, approved
                                    <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decisions into line
                                with the position stated in your memorandum.</p>
                            <p>The actions which you propose are substantially those envisaged in
                                our May 12 reparations and level-of-industry statement in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and in Secretary Acheson’s letter
                                of July 8 to which your memorandum is the reply. Since that time,
                                however, procedures for moving forward with a Japanese peace treaty
                                have, as you know, been discussed with the British Foreign Minister
                                and possibilities of the conclusion of a treaty which would deal
                                definitively with these problems have greatly increased. In these
                                circumstances it would seem preferable for us to present our
                                proposals on Japanese industry to the British in December, and to
                                certain of the other friendly governments concerned, on a
                                high-level, government-to-government basis in the context of our
                                over-all security and other treaty proposals.</p>
                            <p>There are a number of considerations which would seem, indeed, to
                                render this the only feasible course. You will recall, for example,
                                that the provisions in your memorandum regarding the manufacture and
                                operation of civil aircraft specify that such manufacture and
                                operation should be restricted to an extent which “would not
                                constitute a threat to the security of the United States.” The exact
                                restrictions which would be required, which would need to be
                                specified in any proposals to the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"
                                    >FEC</gloss>, apparently remain to be determined. In this
                                instance and in the case of merchant shipping and shipbuilding,
                                moreover, the views of other agencies of the Government will need to
                                be considered, making it unlikely that a final U.S. position on
                                these questions could be obtained before we were ready to initiate
                                discussions on the treaty as a whole with the British. Until
                                decision has been reached within the Government on such basic treaty
                                questions as the size and composition of the Japanese constabulary,
                                and whether the Japanese should be permitted in the treaty to
                                manufacture the arms for the constabulary, it will be impossible to
                                submit new proposals regarding security limitations on Japanese
                                industry to the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>. It would appear

                            <p>1. Reference is made to your memorandum of November 22, 1949,<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">Not printed.</note> subject, Southern
                                Kurile Islands, requesting a study of the legal aspects of the
                                Japanese claim to the retention of Etorofu, Kunashiri, the Habomai
                                Islands and Shikotan.</p>
                            <p>2. The basis of the Soviet claim to these islands is a passage in the
                                Yalta Agreement of February 11, 1945, between the leaders of the
                                Soviet Union, Great Britain and the United States: “The Kuril
                                Islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union”. While there are
                                numerous historical enthnographic, political, economic and strategic
                                reasons for Japanese retention of all of the islands above named,
                                the only legal question involved is the definition of the words
                                “Kuril Islands”, as used in the Yalta Agreement. Since all of these
                                islands were without question part of Japan before the war, they
                                should be retained by Japan unless they are part of the “Kuril
                                Islands” within the meaning of the Yalta Agreement.</p>
                            <pb n="905" xml:id="pg_905" facs="0319"/>
                            <p>3. It is believed that there is sound basis for the legal contention
                                that the Habomai and Shikotan are not properly part of the Kuril
                                Islands. Seasons follow:</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">a. Geographic:</hi> This group of six chief
                                    islands, although sometimes called the “Lesser Kuriles”, is also
                                    known as the “Shikotan Archipelago”, and the five smaller
                                    islands as the “Habomai Group” or the “Suisho” or “Goyomai”
                                    islands. It runs parallel to the Kuril chain, and is 35 to 40
                                    miles distant therefrom. The Kurils are a string of volcanic
                                    islands which are rising from the sea; the Shikotan archipelago
                                    is geologically older and constitutes an extension of the Nemuro
                                    or eastern peninsula of Hokkaido. Consequently, the Kurils are
                                    rugged and often precipitous, while the Shikotan archipelago
                                    consist of low rolling hills.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">b. Historical:</hi> While Russia has at one
                                    time or another claimed or possessed most of the Kuriles
                                    including Etorofu, it has never before claimed any part of the
                                    Shikotan archipelago. Early Russian explorers or settlers
                                    apparently erected markers on Etorofu, which the Japanese threw
                                    down in 1800, when they made settlement on that island. From
                                    that time on Russian expeditons continued their research from
                                    the north only as far as Uruppu. After a near century of dispute
                                    over Etorofu, in the Russo-Japanese Treaty of Amity of 1855, the
                                    frontier between Russia and Japan was drawn between Etorofu and
                                    Uruppu. Etorofu was to belong to Japan, and Uruppu “as well as
                                    all the Kurile Islands situated to the north of this island”,
                                    were to belong to Russia. In the St. Petersburg Treaty of 1875,
                                    in exchange for all Japanese claims to Saghalien, The Emperor of
                                    Russia ceded to the Emperor of Japan “the group of islands
                                    called Kuriles, which he possesses actually, together with all
                                    the rights of sovereignty derived from their possession, so that
                                    henceforth the said group of the Kuriles shall belong to the
                                    Empire of Japan. This group comprises the 18 islands named below
                                    [“]—naming 18 islands north of Etorofu. While the language of
                                    this treaty indicates that the islands ceded to Japan were only
                                    one group of the Kuriles, the other group may well have been
                                    Etorofu and Kunashiri. Both of these treaties are evidence that
                                    Etorofu, at least, is part of the Kuriles, but neither of them
                                    gives any such indication as to the Shikotan archipelago.</item>

                                    <hi rend="italic">c. Political:</hi> The Habomai Islands were
                                    never included politically in the Kurile Islands, but since 1915
                                    have been administered by the Japanese as part of Habomai
                                    Village of Nemuro County of Hokkaido. The Kurile Islands in the
                                    possession of Japan were in Chishima County, another part of the
                                    Nemuro Branch Administration. Shikotan, however, appears to have
                                    been included with the south Kuriles for the sake of
                                    convenience.</item>

                            <p>4. There seems to be no sound legal reason for claiming that
                                Kunashiri and Etorofu are not part of the Kurile Islands. While, as
                                indicated above, they have never been under Russian sovereignty
                                since the Treaty of 1855, both that Treaty and the Treaty of 1875
                                indicate that they were considered to be part of the Kurile Islands.
                                Mr. Fearey’s memorandum of September 1947, summarizes the reasons
                                why the <pb n="906" xml:id="pg_906" facs="0320"/>United States might
                                wish to support Japan’s claim to these islands, but there seems to
                                be no legal support for the wish.</p>
                            <p>5. Note. That Shikotan and the Habomais are economically of
                                importance to Japan is indicated by the fact that these islands
                                produce 40 percent of Hokkaido’s production of Kombu (edible
                                sea-weed), which in turn accounts for 97 percent of Japan’s total
                                production. The waters of all of these islands yield crab, salmon,
                                trout, cod, shark, scallop and whale, as well as the Kombu mentioned
                                above. From 1935 to 1944 inclusive, Shikotan and the Habomais
                                averaged 92,349 metric-tons of these products annually, while
                                Etorofu and Kunashiri averaged 118,850 metric tons. It appears,
                                therefore, that if Shikotan and the Habomais could be preserved for
                                Japan 45 percent of the total fishing potential of the area in

                            <p>With reference to C4–339/14, Japanese Participation in Technical
                                Agreements and Conferences and C4–339/15, Appointment of Japanese
                                Governmental Agents Abroad for Trade and Certain Other Purposes, the
                                United States Representative should urge that these papers,
                                particularly the latter, be forwarded to the Commission as soon as
                                possible.</p>
                            <p>The United States Representative is requested to propose that
                                paragraph 2 of C4–339/14 be amended to read as follows: “Japanese
                                going abroad shall not engage in propaganda activities”.</p>
                            <p>The United States Representative is authorized to approve C4–339/14,
                                provided the substance of the foregoing amendment is accepted by the
                                other members, and C4–339/15, but at the time of voting, should
                                indicate that United States approval and support of these papers in
                                no way prejudices the United States position that, in the absence of
                                a Far Eastern Commission policy decision to the contrary, the
                                Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers has the authority to permit
                                Japan to participate in international relationships. The United
                                States Representative should also point out that his Government has
                                sought the approval of the Commission for these policies in the hope
                                that the member governments of the <gloss target="#t_FEC1"

                            <p>In your meeting with Mr. Voorhees today, you may wish to have in mind
                                the following considerations favoring an early peace treaty:</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The occupation some time ago passed its peak. Its popularity
                                    with the Japanese has diminished and will diminish further if
                                    the natural desire for a treaty, making adequate provision for
                                    Japanese security, is thwarted. If the cooperation which the
                                    Japanese have afforded the occupation should cease, our position
                                    in Japan would become untenable and the occupation
                                    accomplishments would be imperilled.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Japan’s friendly orientation toward the United States cannot
                                    be compelled but must arise from the feelings and considered
                                    interests of the people, which can be better appealed to through
                                    a liberal peace settlement than through continuation of an
                                    increasingly unwelcome occupation.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The Japanese are unlikely to display requisite responsibility
                                    and initiative and otherwise to work with maximum effectiveness
                                    for the solution of their nation’s pressing economic problems
                                    until restored to treaty status. With full responsibility for
                                    their own affairs the traditional energy and initiative of the
                                    Japanese can be expected to reassert themselves, while without
                                    it the tendency to lean on the occupation will continue.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The British, French, Australians and most of our other Allies
                                    strongly desire a treaty. Their unwillingness to approve
                                    piecemeal restoration of Japan to a normal international status
                                    obstructs revival of Japan’s foreign trade and its reorientation
                                    as a peaceful member of the family of nations.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>It is believed of primary political importance that the U.S. be in a
                                position of favoring and attempting to obtain a peace treaty, for
                                the following reasons: (1) the desire of the Japanese for a treaty;
                                (2) the desire of our Allies for a treaty; (3) to avoid a situation
                                where the Soviets are for and we against a treaty; and (4) to obtain
                                the full support of the American people and the people of the Far
                                East in the event we have to go ahead without Soviet
                                concurrence.</p>
                            <p>It is important in the light of these factors, of your understanding
                                with Mr. Bevin, and of the short interval remaining before the
                                Commonwealth Conference scheduled for January 9, that the Defense
                                Department, in accordance with the understanding with the President,
                                proceed urgently with the determination of U.S. security
                                requirements to be incorporated in a draft peace treaty. The <gloss

                                whether we should proceed with discussions with friendly <gloss

                                a peace conference should be held on the basis of this draft treaty,

                            <p>Bill Sebald has just forwarded to me two reports<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d170fn1">Neither printed.</note> (attached) entitled
                                “Special Report” and “Soviet Use and Treatment of Japanese POWs”,
                                both of which he had received on a confidential basis from General
                                Willoughby, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>’s <gloss
                                    target="#t_G21">G–2</gloss>. The two reports offer dramatic
                                testimony of Soviet failure to carry out their end of the
                                repatriation agreement. Both reports—the latter in greater
                                detail—discuss at length such matters as the high death factor in
                                Soviet POW camps, Soviet exploitation of Japanese POW labor, Soviet
                                indoctrination of POWs, the crass disregard of the last batch of
                                Communist-indoctrinated POWs toward their families and
                                fatherland.</p>
                            <p>Sebald understands that the “Special Report” is to be released to the
                                press early this December after the Soviets have completed the
                                repatriation of the last batch of 10,000 POWs they claim to be
                                remaining in Soviet territory. (<gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> and Japanese figures show 400,000 Japanese POWs
                                still remaining in Siberia, Sakhalin and the Kuriles.) The other
                                report may be released later. Sebald points out that the idea of
                                releasing this material originated with General MacArthur who
                                ordered its preparation many months ago.</p>

                                repatriation issue as the best anti-Communist theme in his book. He
                                played it with notable success over the last summer when the
                                pro-Communist returning POWs deserted their families awaiting them
                                at the station in order to join Communist rallies. Evidently he has

                            <p>Sebald has not offered any comment, implied or otherwise, as to
                                whether or not he believes the documents should be released. Viewed
                                from <gloss target="#t_NA1">NA</gloss>, there would appear to be no
                                objection to the release of the first document. Release of the
                                second document is considered inadvisable because it presents raw
                                intelligence which would probably be ineffective as propaganda and
                                which might disclose sources of information and otherwise prejudice
                                intelligence acquisition from Soviet areas.</p>

                                concerning a proposed Far Eastern Commission policy decision which
                                would permit official Japanese trade agents to maintain offices
                                abroad and/or perform certain functions pertaining to the civil
                                status and property rights of Japanese Nationals who are residing
                                abroad, but is unable to support the proposed policy.</p>
                            <p>The Australian Government would not deny, now that two-way trade
                                between Japan and other countries is gaining momentum, that the
                                Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers can scarcely be expected to
                                continue to control Japanese trade indefinitely without increasing
                                his staff, and that, if there were no prospect of a peace settlement
                                with Japan, some additional machinery or other facilities would in
                                due course have to be established.</p>
                            <p>The Australian Government, however, is not convinced that the only
                                way to develop trade between Japan and other countries is to allow
                                the Japanese Government to establish trade promotion offices abroad
                                and that the establishment of such offices is a matter of great
                                urgency. Because of exchange difficulties, trade between Japan and
                                its largest customers is likely for some time to remain subject to
                                some form of Governmental control at each end, and it would not
                                appear that a trade promotion campaign conducted by official
                                Japanese trade agents abroad would give an immediate and appreciable
                                stimulus to Japanese trade nor that this is a matter of extreme
                                urgency.</p>
                            <p>It would also appear that it is not a matter of extreme urgency that
                                official Japanese trade agents should be permitted to handle matters
                                affecting the civil status and property rights of Japanese abroad.
                                Such matters have presumably been dealt with under established
                                procedures since the commencement of the war with Japan and it seems
                                unlikely that they have increased in volume or complexity so
                                suddenly as to call for the urgent establishment of new
                                machinery.</p>
                            <p>The reasons advanced in support of the proposed policy, as set forth
                                in the Department of State’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>,
                                are, in the opinion of the <pb n="910" xml:id="pg_910" facs="0324"
                                />Australian Government, arguments in favour of an early peace
                                settlement with Japan. A resumption by Japan of normal international
                                functions and responsibilities in advance of a general settlement
                                could in its view be justified only if there were no prospect of
                                concluding such a settlement. The Australian Government considers
                                that an early peace settlement is desirable and feasible and that
                                every effort should be made to conclude it with the least possible
                                delay. Unless and until a settlement complete with appropriate
                                safe-guards for the Japanese its well as for the Allies is shown to
                                be impracticable, the Australian government sees no need to raise
                                unnecessary legal difficulties or run a future security risk by
                                resolving in a piece-meal fashion matters which should properly be
                                decided by a Peace Conference.</p>

                                armies, in war against Japan; fight waged in Manchuria by Korean

                                settlement. Should <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> be entirely
                                excluded, prestige of government would be seriously impaired and
                                such action could logically be regarded as backward step by US and
                                UN in fostering <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Apart from
                                foregoing considerations, it appears essential to have Japan
                                committed by peace treaty, to which Korea is a party, to reaffirm
                                relinquishment of all sovereign rights to Korea.</p>
                            <p>Although <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has advanced unrealistic
                                claims against Japan going back to 1905, we believe Koreans can be
                                persuaded to accept existing allocation of Japanese property, public
                                and private, situated in Korea as total Japanese reparations,
                                provided that <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> Korean property
                                interests in Japan are treated in accordance with ordinary property
                                laws. Accordingly, we do not anticipate Korean participation in
                                negotiation of peace settlement would be serious source of
                                embarrassment to other negotiating powers. Before extending any
                                invitation to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to participate we
                                could, if desired, privately inform <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> invitation contingent upon not presenting further
                                reparations claim. In this connection we feel Korean eagerness to be
                                signatory is such that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
                                agree to foregoing terms.</p>
                            <p>Another consideration persuading US toward Korean participation is
                                our feeling Japanese-Korean problems can better be resolved through
                                international forum than through bilateral negotiation.</p>

                            <p>In commenting upon Mr. Oliver’s report<note n="1" xml:id="d174fn1"
                                    >See letter of July 29, <ref target="#pg_815">p.
                                    815</ref>.</note> you asked whether more push is necessary to
                                remedy the situation in the Ryukyus.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Voorhees visited Okinawa in September, having been briefed before
                                his departure by Mr. Oliver. He was extremely dissatisfied with the
                                situation as he found it, and has personally directed many of the
                                measures now being taken. The most important of them are set forth
                                below.</p>
                            <p>They represent only the start of an adequate program in the Ryukyus.
                                Questions which require greater attention are the recruiting of
                                competent personnel, including the possibility of putting in a
                                civilian as head of the civil administration; and the scale of
                                pay-as-you-go by the military which presently omits land rental and
                                provides extremely low wages. The Department of the Army appears to
                                be doing all that can be expected at the moment, however, and I do
                                not think that more pressure would be useful.</p>
                            <p>1. There is a new top administration on the Islands and some of the
                                worst officers have left. Although he has not yet been able to
                                recruit an able staff, General Sheetz, unlike his predecessor, has
                                taken a strong interest in his military government
                                responsibilities.</p>
                            <p>2. At my instance, the Department of the Army has sent a proposed new
                                directive, substantially as drafted in the Department of State to
                                    <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss> for comment requesting
                                urgent consideration (copy attached). This directive covers most of
                                the abuses which have been reported and even before formal issuance
                                should afford badly needed guidance to the field.</p>
                            <p>3. A $73,000,000 construction program, including $22,000,000 for
                                housing, is under way with procurement of materials and services
                                being made as far as possible in the Ryukyus and Japan. Although
                                primarily for military purposes, this will have considerable effect
                                on the civilian economy.</p>
                            <p>4. A revised program has been developed for the expenditure of <gloss
                                    target="#t_GARIOA1">GARIOA</gloss> appropriations in the current
                                fiscal year, amounting to approximately $25,000,000, largely for
                                economic rehabilitation and including housing for military
                                government personnel. The latter is basic for the recruiting of
                                abler personnel.</p>
                            <p>5. A trade agreement has been made with <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss> under which purchases up to $9,000,000 will be
                                made by the Ryukyus and up to $1,000,000 by Japan.</p>
                            <pb n="913" xml:id="pg_913" facs="0327"/>
                            <p>6. An agricultural mission sent out by the Department of the Army has
                                made an excellent report to the Commanding General late in November
                                which he declared his intention to carry out. The report stresses
                                the administrative measures necessary to improve the condition of
                                the Ryukyuan economy, which is almost entirely agricultural. The
                                principal such recommendation is that a central native
                                administration be established with responsibility for the entire
                                area, and that the military administration establish parallel
                                divisions. The report also stresses the necessity to keep land
                                occupancy by the military to a minimum.</p>
                            <p>7. A financial and general economic team from <gloss target="#t_GHQ1"
                                    >GHQ</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> went to the
                                Ryukyus several weeks ago to make recommendations for a coordinated
                                economic and fiscal plan, covering problems of the exchange rate,
                                Ryukyus budget, wage levels, pricing of imports, etc. In view of the
                                varied types of U.S. expenditures and their significance for the
                                total economy, these are extremely complicated problems, and <gloss
                                    target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> is seeking further information in
                                order to be of any possible assistance. It is understood that Mr.
                                Dodge decided not to undertake a study along these lines, because he
                                did not have opportunity to do it justice.</p>

                                    Japan to the forces of the Allied Powers, and the principles of

                                    will be executed pursuant to this directive and other
                                    instructions from your government. The government of this area
                                    by the United States will be termed “U.S. Civil Administration

                            <p>579. Immediately upon opening of regular Allied Council meeting this
                                morning, Soviet member Lt. Gen. Derevyanko raised question of
                                procedure charging that rejection his subject “on violation of the
                                principles and unfulfillment of the problems of the democratization
                                of Japan” proposed in his letter dated November 14, 1949,<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d177fn1">Quoted in telegram 498, November 16, from

                                arbitrary and unjustified and that subsequent letter dated December
                                5 stating his intention to discuss “anti-democratic measures of
                                Japanese Government” at forthcoming meeting of Council had been
                                similarly rejected without reason. He also strongly protested
                                against discussion of repatriation problem which I had placed on
                                agenda for today APO’s meeting at Supreme Commander APO’s direction
                                stating that proposed discussion of this subject not only was
                                inappropriate but obviously constituted a part of campaign of
                                hostility and propaganda conducted against Soviet Union by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> Headquarters. I pointed out that
                                subject for discussion proposed in Soviet letter of November 14 had
                                been rejected because, as phrased, it involved review of action
                                taken by <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> under directives
                                issued to him in conformity with <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>
                                policy decision and that such review was proper subject for <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> and not AC J; also that letter of
                                December 5 only stated an intention to place subject on agenda but
                                contained no specific wording of subject. After further brief
                                exchange during which Soviet member refused follow ruling of
                                chairman and conducted himself in unruly manner, Soviet member
                                stated he could not take part in meeting permitting discussion of
                                Japanese repatriation and thereupon left meeting accompanied by
                                staff.</p>

                                Soviet Government be reminded of obligations under 1929 Prisoners of

                            <p>582. Following is text of statement issued by General MacArthur to
                                press at 3 p. m. today, Tokyo time:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have accepted the wise recommendation of the British
                                    Commonwealth member, made at yesterday’s meeting of the Allied
                                    Council, to seek the help of a neutral nation such as
                                    Switzerland, or of the International Red Cross, to gather the
                                    fullest possible details of the tragic fate of the 376,000
                                    missing Japanese prisoners. To this end I am requesting the
                                    United States Govt to attempt to negotiate the necessary
                                    arrangements. I can well understand the reluctance of the Soviet
                                    member yesterday to listen to so gruesome and savage a story in
                                    all its harrowing barbarity. It could well chill and sicken even

                                    irrefutably shown to be completely prejudiced, if not actually
                                    false, that their continued repetition could well be ignored
                                    under normal circumstances as merely blatant propaganda. But
                                    when, as at this moment, they are again taken from the shelf and
                                    freshly dusted off to act as a smoke screen to distract
                                    attention from the investigation of the dreadful fate of
                                    hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners probably dead on

                                be Chairman of the conference and that it will be attended by the
                                principal economic officer at each of the following posts: Manila,
                                Seoul, Bangkok, Saigon, Singapore, Batavia, Hong Kong, Taipei, and
                                possibly Rangoon, Karachi and New Delhi, as well as by such officers
                                at Tokyo, Yokahama and Kobe as you may consider desirable.
                                Representation from Washington has not yet been decided, but it
                                appears that there will be not more than a total of six from the
                                Department of Commerce and other concerned departments, thus making
                                a total of approximately 19 persons excluding persons already
                                resident in Tokyo. The Department would also desire that at least
                                some of the sessions of the conference be attended by such personnel
                                of <gloss target="#t_GHQ1">GHQ</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"

                            <p>In order that planning for the conference may be completed as quickly
                                as possible it would be appreciated if you would immediately
                                approach <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to determine whether
                                it will be possible to obtain suitable accommodations in Tokyo for

                                Department by telegraph.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: On October 3rd, you
                                wrote me requesting advice as to the essential security requirements
                                of the United States in a peace settlement with Japan. This
                                presented military questions of great seriousness and difficulty,
                                which depended in some degree upon legal questions.</p>
                            <p>I regret that it has not been possible to answer your letter at an
                                earlier date, but I know that you have been kept informed of the
                                reasons which prevented this.</p>
                            <p>Inclosed is the opinion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff which I have
                                just received. I concur in this opinion.</p>
                            <p>I am concerned about the psychological effect upon the Japanese—and
                                therefore about the effect upon the success of our
                                occupation—resulting from the wide-spread public discussion during
                                recent months about an early treaty, including extensive debates in
                                the Japanese Diet. This prospect has raised great hopes in Japan. I
                                feel that we must promptly give consideration to the steps necessary
                                to deal with this very real problem.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                                <p>From the military point of view the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                    consider that a treaty to be acceptable must include both the
                                    USSR and the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government of China
                                    as party signators to the document.</p>
                                <p>In light of the conditions noted in paragraph 1 <hi rend="italic"
                                        >b</hi> above and since it is apparent that the minimum
                                    military requirements and the requirement that the USSR be a
                                    party signator to the document are probably mutually exclusive,
                                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff reaffirm their previous view that
                                    negotiations now, leading toward a peace treaty with Japan, are
                                    still premature.</p>
                                <p>If, nevertheless, it is decided that peace treaty negotiations
                                    shall be undertaken, it is requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                                    collaborate in the formulation of those terms of the treaty
                                    having military implications.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary said he asked General Bradley and General Burns to come
                                in in reference to the situation confronting us incident to the
                                receipt of Secretary of Defense Johnson’s letter of December 23 on
                                the subject of the essential security requirements of the United
                                States in a peace settlement with Japan. The Secretary commented
                                that he did not want to discuss the letter this morning but before
                                passing to another aspect of the situation would simply state his
                                reaction to one feature of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                memorandum enclosed with Secretary Johnson’s letter. In the <gloss
                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> memorandum there was set forth the
                                    <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>’s estimate of military
                                requirements postulating the continued presence of U.S. forces in
                                Japan and in various islands. Those requirements we could
                                appreciate. At another point the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                memorandum contained the statement that an acceptable peace treaty
                                with Japan must include both the USSR and the <hi rend="italic">de
                                    facto</hi> government of China as parties to the document. In
                                view of these two conclusions, the view expressed by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> that negotiations leading toward a
                                peace treaty with Japan are premature represents, in the Secretary’s
                                opinion, a masterpiece of understatement. The Secretary said that
                                the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> view really described a
                                long-term, not a temporary situation. The Secretary continued that
                                we would want to discuss this feature of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                    >JCS</gloss> memorandum and all its implications. This morning,
                                however, he was merely calling attention to it.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary also pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                    >JCS</gloss> memorandum referred to one sentence in <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3 to the effect that this
                                Government should not press for a treaty of peace at this time. The
                                Secretary said he would like to read the whole paragraph in which
                                this statement appeared. The Secretary then read paragraph No. 1 of
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 13/3 as follows:</p>

                                    the differences which have developed among the interested
                                    countries regarding the procedure and substance of a Japanese
                                    peace treaty and in view of the serious international situation
                                    created by the Soviet Union’s policy of aggressive Communist
                                    expansion, this Government should not press for a treaty of
                                    peace at this time. It should remain prepared to proceed with
                                    the negotiations, under some generally acceptable voting
                                    procedure, if the <pb n="925" xml:id="pg_925" facs="0339"
                                    />Allied Powers can agree among themselves on such a procedure.
                                    We should, before actually entering into a peace conference,
                                    seek through the diplomatic channel the concurrence of a
                                    majority of the participating countries in the principal points
                                    of content we desire to have in such a treaty. Meanwhile, we
                                    should concentrate our attention on the preparation of the
                                    Japanese for the eventual removal of the regime of
                                    control.”</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>The Secretary said that what we were doing was to follow out the
                                procedure set forth in the above quoted paragraph. When Mr. Bevin
                                was here in September, he and the Secretary had discussed the
                                question of the Japanese peace treaty. As the procedure was so
                                closely connected with the content of the treaty, it had been agreed
                                that they would work toward an exchange of views on the content of a
                                possible treaty. If they found that they could agree on the
                                principal points of content, a procedure under which voting would be
                                by two-thirds or by a simple majority might be feasible. This might
                                eliminate the need for considering the veto. A conference might even
                                proceed along prewar lines where each country would be free to
                                accept the conclusions of the conference or not to accept them. The
                                British, Australians, Canadians and others have consistently
                                advocated an early peace treaty with Japan.</p>
                            <p>In the light of Secretary Johnson’s letter of December 23, we are
                                obviously not going to be able to meet the time schedule
                                contemplated when the Secretary talked with Mr. Bevin in September.
                                Some ten days ago Mr. Bevin had telegraphed the Secretary asking
                                whether the Secretary could not give him some indications of the
                                U.S. position on the treaty. The British Ambassador<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d181fn1">Sir Oliver Franks.</note> had also been in to
                                see the Secretary. The British Government was obviously embarrassed
                                by the lack of information from us in connection with the
                                forthcoming Ceylon meeting. If we furnish the British nothing by way
                                of information, the result is certain to be that the United States
                                would be blamed by some of the Commonwealth Governments for dragging
                                its feet. This was quite likely to become a matter of comment in the
                                press. It would get to Japan and would have an unfavorable reaction
                                upon the Japanese people, who are eager for a treaty, and
                                consequently upon occupation. This point was mentioned in the last
                                paragraph of Secretary Johnson’s letter of December 23. Thus, if we
                                do nothing, the result would pretty certainly be unfortunate. The
                                Secretary therefore had in mind asking the British Ambassador to
                                come in and reading to him a statement which had been drawn up for
                                that purpose. Copies of the statement were passed to General Bradley
                                and General Burns. The Secretary then read aloud the proposed
                                    statement.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">

                                    n="926" xml:id="pg_926" facs="0340"/>Burns’ views as to the
                                proposed procedure and statement. General Bradley said he thought
                                the statement expressed the situation very well and would be useful
                                to pass on to the British Ambassador for Mr. Bevin. General Burns
                                said he also liked the statement and fully concurred in the proposed
                                course of action.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary said he was glad to know that their views coincided
                                with ours and he would proceed as planned and ask the British
                                Ambassador to come in, at which time he would read the statement to
                                the Ambassador and perhaps hand him a copy, not as a formal
                                communication but as an informal record of what the Secretary had
                                said.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary explained that we hoped by this statement to get the
                                Commonwealth Governments to appreciate the security problems
                                confronting the United States and to become really concerned about
                                these problems which had a direct bearing on their own security.</p>
                            <p>During the interchange of comment, General Bradley remarked that they
                                of course wanted a peace treaty with Japan as soon as feasible. A
                                military occupation began to run down hill after two or three years.
                                At present there were many uncertainties in the military situation
                                in the Far East both on the mainland and in reference to Taiwan.
                                Possibly in six months or a year the situation would change in such
                                a way that we would know better where we stood.</p>
                            <p>General Bradley referred in passing to the fact that it would
                                probably be necessary at some time to let Japan have armed forces
                                and that it did not make any sense for an independent nation of 80
                                million people not to have an army to defend itself. He indicated
                                agreement that at the present it was not feasible to permit Japan to
                                rearm.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the conversation, the Secretary said that in the
                                paper he proposed to read the British Ambassador there had been
                                incorporated some of the thought underlying the Department of
                                Defense’s position. It was of course possible that something
                                regarding the U.S. position would get in the press from the Ceylon
                                meeting or from some of the attending governments. One of the
                                reasons why the Secretary had asked General Bradley and General
                                Burns to meet with him that morning was that he might acquaint them
                                with that possibility. If some publicity resulted, the Secretary
                                desired to have their concurrence in the procedure so that the
                                Department of State would not be charged later by the Department of
                                Defense with responsibility for a leak.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary thanked General Bradley and General Burns for coming
                                in.</p>

                            <p>I asked you in today in further reference to the subject of the
                                Japanese peace treaty. As you know, since Mr. Bevin left we have
                                been working intensively exploring possibilities to see whether we
                                could come up with a preliminary United States position and whether
                                we could find a way for going ahead with a treaty at this time. On a
                                good many aspects we have been able to reach tentative conclusions,
                                but unfortunately in the very important matter of security we have
                                not as yet been able to find satisfactory answers to certain basic
                                problems confronting us. I regret therefore that we are unable to
                                meet the contemplated schedule. I feel it might be helpful for Mr.
                                Bevin to know the general nature of some of our difficulties.</p>
                            <p>The United States has been acutely aware that the basic problem
                                underlying a treaty is security; that is, to avoid any peace
                                settlement which would weaken the United States security position in
                                the western Pacific and therefore the security of all other
                                like-minded powers in that area. The United States also appreciates
                                that security clauses in the treaty must be dual in purpose:
                                security against renewed Japanese aggression and security for Japan
                                against Soviet-Communist aggression. The two aggressive threats
                                appear closely related, however, for in its present state of
                                complete disarmament Japan can be realistically regarded as a future
                                threat only if allied or in cooperation with Soviet military might.
                                Several background factors render this contingency serious.</p>
                            <p>The USSR is the great and expanding power in Asia, with its influence
                                spreading well beyond the actual areas now under Soviet control.
                                This situation has been abetted by Japan’s defeat which, ending the
                                long-standing balance of power in East Asia, has paved the way for
                                the striking extension of Soviet influence over continental East
                                Asia witnessed in the past four years. Soviet pressures are certain
                                to be intensified against Japan itself, for were Japan added to the
                                Communist bloc, the Soviets would acquire skilled manpower and
                                industrial potential capable of significantly altering the balance
                                of world power.</p>
                            <p>To this end, the Soviets are already pursuing the familiar Communist
                                patterns of infiltration, subversion and propaganda in Japan, backed
                                up by important psychological advantages: (a) <hi rend="italic"
                                    >intimidation</hi>—playing upon disarmed Japan’s fear of
                                Communist power which has already expanded to points within a few
                                miles of Japan; (b) <hi rend="italic">self</hi>–<pb n="928"
                                    xml:id="pg_928" facs="0342"/>
                                <hi rend="italic">interest</hi>—playing upon Japanese desires to
                                trade with areas upon which it is traditionally dependent for a
                                sizable proportion of its raw materials and markets; (c) <hi
                                    rend="italic">the structure of the Japanese society</hi> which
                                is not antithetical to totalitarian doctrines, since the Japanese
                                are communal people long accustomed to passive acceptance of
                                leadership and subordination of individual interests to the
                                state’s.</p>
                            <p>The United States therefore believes Soviet potentialities toward
                                Japan must be given the most serious consideration and that, however
                                much a treaty may be desirable, one which fails to give Japan
                                adequate protection against Communist aggression, outright or
                                subversive, may well be worse than no treaty at all.</p>
                            <p>In the present circumstances in Asia, we feel that it would be
                                essential that there be retained United States forces in Japan,
                                including the Ryukyu and Bonin Islands. If arrangements for the
                                retention of these forces were to be concluded with Japan in a
                                bilateral agreement between the United States and Japan, as
                                suggested by Mr. Bevin, it would be necessary to specify the period
                                of time for their retention and, possibly, their size. Because of
                                uncertainties in the whole Far Eastern picture, the time limit and
                                size of forces would have to be on the maximum side. This in turn
                                raises the serious question of unfortunate psychological reactions
                                in Japan and other Far Eastern countries.</p>
                            <p>No alternative desirable means for Japan’s security exists.
                                Neutrality is illusory in the context of East-West tensions. Thus,
                                while Western Powers honored their obligation to observe Japanese
                                neutrality, the Soviets would continue to pursue infiltration
                                tactics, permitting them ultimately to turn Japan into an aggressive
                                military threat. There are no United Nations security forces. The
                                rearming of Japan for self-defense is not under present
                                circumstances an acceptable alternative.</p>
                            <p>United States security requirements of the nature outlined rule out,
                                in our opinion, any real prospect that the USSR or Communist China
                                would be party to the treaty. At the present time, United States
                                forces are in Japan performing security functions on the basis of
                                agreed international instruments to which the USSR and China are
                                parties. To sign a new agreement to which those two countries would
                                not be parties and which would alter the existing legal basis raises
                                the question of a less secure legal basis internationally for the
                                continued presence of our forces.</p>
                            <p>These security points are not conclusions, but represent problems to
                                which we have been unable as yet to find adequate answers. In view
                                of the unsettled political and military conditions in Asian
                                continental areas near Japan and in Southeast Asia, it is, of
                                course, highly important that wise and soundly conceived conclusions
                                be arrived at.</p>
                            <p>The United States and British Governments, as well as others,
                                attempted in 1947 to bring about a peace conference and failed. When
                                    <pb n="929" xml:id="pg_929" facs="0343"/>Mr. Bevin was here in
                                September, we renewed consideration of methods of accomplishing this
                                and concluded that since procedure might well be closely connected
                                with the desired content of a treaty we should exchange views on the
                                latter. For reasons indicated above we are not yet able to do this
                                concretely. Within the United States Government we intend to
                                continue to work intensively at formulating a definite United States
                                Government position. We propose to keep in the closest possible
                                touch with the British Government about the matter.</p>

                            <p>Following my talk with General Bradley and General Burns, I asked the
                                British Ambassador to come to see me. I explained that in view of
                                the imminence of Mr. Bevin’s departure by boat for Ceylon, I wished
                                to discuss with him what could be explained to Mr. Bevin about the
                                nature of the problems with which we were faced in considering a
                                possible Japanese peace treaty. I read him the prepared
                                    statement<note n="1" xml:id="d183fn1">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> and emphasized its informal
                                nature and the fact that it was addressed to him. I pointed out the
                                adverse repercussions which would flow from any publicity emanating
                                from the Ceylon Conference to the effect that the United States was
                                holding back on proceeding with a Japanese peace treaty; that it was
                                in all of our interests that it should be fully appreciated by
                                everyone, including the Japanese, that it was the predatory and
                                uncooperative attitude of Soviet Russia that was at the root of our
                                difficulties. It was essential that the Japanese should understand
                                this clearly and not be misled by any contrary propaganda. I also
                                pointed out the undesirability of Mr. Bevin becoming at the Ceylon
                                Conference the spokesman of the American point of view as defined in
                                this memorandum. To all this the British Ambassador readily
                                assented. He volunteered to send a telegram to Mr. Bevin explaining
                                the whole situation to be followed by a letter enclosing the
                                memorandum, it being understood that the memorandum was given to the
                                British Ambassador personally and on the condition its use would
                                merely be for Mr. Bevin’s background and as guidance to him in
                                leading the discussion at the Ceylon Conference into constructive
                                channels. Sir Oliver Franks indicated he was sending the memorandum
                                by mail so that it would not pass through the normal <pb n="930"
                                    xml:id="pg_930" facs="0344"/>distribution channels and would
                                merely be a personal communication from him to his Secretary of
                                State.</p>
                            <p>Sir Oliver Franks went on to say that he thought the memorandum was a
                                very helpful document and should be much appreciated by Mr. Bevin.
                                He felt it would be useful in assisting Mr. Bevin in his conduct of
                                the discussions at the conference; he felt he should say personally
                                regardless of the trouble to which one went, in the last analysis
                                how well the Ceylon Conference determinations went depended a good
                                deal upon Mr. Bevin’s state of health and vigor at the moment a
                                matter over which he, of course, had no control.</p>
                            <p>I told him of my desire to apprise Ambassador Wrong for transmission
                                to Mr. Pearson<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">Lester B. Pearson,
                                    Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs.</note> of the
                                contents of this memorandum for Mr. Pearson’s background. Sir Oliver
                                Franks felt this was a desirable thing and perceived no objection to
                                the procedure.</p>
                            <p>As he was leaving, the British Ambassador asked whether he could put
                                this memorandum in the context of a remark that the U.S. conceived
                                its interest in that area of the world as an arc which stretched
                                from Japan through to India and that our interest was not merely a
                                line so to speak drawn from California through Japan to China. I
                                said that the arc concept fitted other discussions that we had had
                                and at my invitation Mr. Butterworth elaborated by pointing out that
                                some thought had been given in the Department to the desirability of
                                discussing more precisely how that arc was made up in terms of the
                                community of interests between the British Empire and the United
                                States. In terms of that community of interests in the Japanese and
                                Philippine area of that arc, we found ourselves bearing the major
                                responsibility. We were likewise prepared to give a helping hand in
                                Indonesia but that in the area north of Singapore, in Burma in
                                particular, in a lesser degree in Thailand, and to some extent in
                                French Indochina, the physical location of power points, custom,
                                knowledge and circumstance made this area of primary United Kingdom
                                and Empire concern; that however was not to suggest that the U.S.
                                was not prepared to play a helpful role. Mr. Butterworth pointed out
                                that perhaps at times the situation in that area of the arc suffered
                                from the fact that there might be an inadequate realization on the
                                part of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth or the U.S.
                                as to the role of the other.</p>

                            <p>At the Secretary’s suggestion, I called at Ambassador Wrong’s
                                residence this afternoon and handed him a copy of the memorandum
                                which the Secretary had given to the British Ambassador this
                                morning. I reviewed with the Canadian Ambassador the attempt this
                                Government had made two and a half years ago with a view to bringing
                                about a Japanese peace treaty and summarized the discussions with
                                Mr. Bevin and the appropriate part of today’s conversation with Sir
                                Oliver Franks. Ambassador Wrong was appreciative of the step taken,
                                indicating that he would send the memorandum to Mr. Pearson by
                                confidential mail and would make clear that it was merely for his
                                background guidance and not for specific reference at the
                                Conference.</p>
                            <p>By recounting to the Canadian Ambassador that part of the Secretary’s
                                conversation with the British Ambassador which dealt with the
                                Anglo-American arc of interest extending from Japan through the
                                Philippines and Southeast Asia to India, I had an opportunity to
                                reinforce the recent discussion which Mr. Rusk had had with
                                Ambassador Wrong in terms of the Commonwealth taking greater
                                initiative and responsibility for the mainland promontory of
                                Southeast Asia. The Canadian Ambassador obviously had this question
                                very much in mind because it was he who referred to Mr. Rusk’s
                                previous discussion with him.</p>

                            <p>Sovs will use maximum pressure to communize Jap. Jap islands occupy
                                such strategic position off Eastern Asiatic seacoast that Kremlin
                                control thereof wld extend Sov power into Western Pacific to
                                alarming degree. Command of seas and air over the seas along Eastern
                                Asia littoral wld pass to Russians, and chain of islands leading
                                southward as far as East Indies and Singapore wld be definitely
                                threatened. Govts throughout that area wld be placed in great
                                jeopardy by impact of militant Communism based on Jap islands.
                                Effects cld spread westward into Indian sub-continent areas.</p>
                            <p>Cardinal point in prescibed method of spreading Communism as
                                enunciated by Sov writers is presence Sov mil power along frontier
                                common to that of next selected victim. Sov press boasts effect
                                presence Red Army in accomplishing sovietizing of Sov satellites.
                                These successes contrast with Sov failures in countries where there
                                exists no common frontier.</p>
                            <p>Spread of Sov system by such tactics constitutes forcible acquisition
                                of territory just as definitely as territorial aggrandizement by
                                open mil conquest. Inevitably in varying degrees of speed the new
                                victim is shackled to Moscow direction and control.</p>
                            <p>[Here follows quotation based on the same text from the fourth
                                paragraph through the ninth, concluding with the next-to-last
                                sentence of paragraph ten.]</p>
                            <p>In 1947 Sov attitude on procedure prevented progress toward peace
                                treaty. Since that time Sov penetration of other countries and
                                tactics of indirect aggression have added to original Sov blocking
                                in making difficult progress toward Jap peace treaty. Jap people are
                                eager for treaty. Against this background it is highly important
                                that nothing result from Ceylon mtg which would cause Jap people to
                                feel that countries other than Sov Union are responsible for delay
                                or difficulty in according Jap treaty status. US feels this point is
                                psychologically of utmost importance.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Plimsoll, an old friend from the time he was a member of the
                                Australian Delegation to the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss>,
                                dropped in to see me today and during the course of the general
                                conversation had the following remarks to make concerning Japan and
                                a possible treaty.</p>
                            <p>He stated that in his opinion it would be impossible to expect the
                                USSR to sign any treaty which permitted the United States to retain
                                bases or troops in Japan and that therefore, in view of the
                                necessity from a security point of view of some such arrangement, he
                                did not see how we could proceed with treaty negotiations. I stated
                                that this was, of course, one of the problems of which we were
                                acutely conscious and for which we were trying to find a solution. I
                                then asked him what he thought would be the future course of action
                                with respect to Japan if in fact it should prove impossible to
                                obtain a treaty; and I reminded him of the reluctance of his
                                Government and others to acquiesce in steps proposed by the United
                                States for allowing Japan progressively to assume more international
                                responsibilities. Mr. Plimsoll replied that in his opinion the new
                                Australian Government<note n="1" xml:id="d186fn1">Robert Gordon
                                    Menzies, Prime Minister since December 19. Percy C. Spender

                                would wish to go as far as possible in cooperating with the United
                                States on Japanese matters, but that he was certain that such
                                cooperation could be made easier if some sort of definite defense
                                arrangements could be concluded regarding the Pacific between the
                                United States and Australia. He went on to say that while the
                                Australians recognize that Japan on its own could probably not
                                become an aggressive menace for some years, nevertheless there was
                                real fear in Australia that the United States might be building up
                                the economic and industrial potential of Japan to a high degree,
                                after which it might be taken over by the USSR and used against the
                                other nations of Asia. It was this contingency as well as a
                                resurgent militaristic Japan against which Australia wished to
                                protect itself. He said that if Australia had assurances of joint
                                action with the United States in case of trouble in the Pacific,
                                there would not be nearly as much opposition to United States plans
                                for a piecemeal treaty with Japan.</p>
                            <p>I made no comment other than to repeat that this whole problem of
                                security in the Pacific, particularly as concerned Japan, was
                                receiving the closest scrutiny by all concerned in this
                                Government.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Plimsoll has been for some time a Far Eastern expert in the
                                Australian Ministry of External Affairs and was for a period closely
                                associated with Mr. Evatt. It is believed that he is in a position
                                to know the general feeling amongst at least the permanent element
                                in the Australian Ministry of External Affairs and that he was
                                reflecting its views in the above remarks.</p>

                            <p>It would be to the advantage of the United States to have a <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decision which would give
                                the approval of the Far Eastern Commission to Japan’s participating
                                with other nations in international agreements, conventions and
                                conferences. Such a policy decision would probably meet the demands
                                of a number of states which have insisted that Japan must receive
                                the approval of the Far Eastern Commission in order legally to
                                become a member of such international organizations as the Universal
                                Postal Union and the International Telecommunications Union. Some
                                states, to be sure, are opposed to Japan’s becoming a full member of
                                any international organization before a treaty of peace with Japan
                                is signed and ratified. A sufficient number of states, however,
                                would probably be satisfied by such a policy decision as <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>–339/20 so that Japan would be
                                admitted to such international organizations as the Universal Postal
                                Union and the International Telecommunications Union without
                                particular difficulty.</p>
                            <p>Such a <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decision as <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>–339/20 would appear to be of further
                                advantage to the United States since it would demonstrate the desire
                                of the United States to cooperate with the other states on the <pb
                                    n="936" xml:id="pg_936" facs="0350"/>Commission. With a possible
                                peace conference in the near future, it is obviously the part of
                                wisdom to maintain the good will of our coming colleagues in the
                                conference and not needlessly to arouse their opposition and
                                antagonism.</p>
                            <p>(2) Paragraph 2 which reads: “Japanese going abroad should not engage
                                in political activities”.</p>
                            <p>The United States Government is at present opposed to this paragraph.
                                Our Government, however, has previously twice voted for a similar
                                paragraph (See II, <hi rend="italic">Facts</hi>, 3). Our Government
                                assumably does not wish Japanese abroad to engage in propaganda,
                                espionage or political-organization activities. Our opposition is
                                apparently based somewhat on the fact that the word “political” is
                                so elastic in meaning that it might lead to differing
                                interpretations and to misunderstanding (the sole reason advanced by
                                the U.S. member in the Steering Committee); and even more on the
                                fact that the paragraph would bar the Japanese Government from
                                assigning political duties to its representatives to technical
                                conferences. The paragraph would undoubtedly constitute such a bar,
                                but this would be little more than an inconvenience; it would not
                                bar the Japanese Government, if it had the approval of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, from assigning political duties
                                to specially appointed Japanese representatives nor from assigning
                                such duties to the Japanese agents to be appointed to facilitate
                                Japanese trade and to assist Japanese nationals in matters regarding
                                their civil status and property rights.</p>
                            <p>(3) The Prospects of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>–339/20.</p>
                            <p>On the basis of discussions both within and without the Steering
                                Committee it seems probable that this policy paper will not pass in
                                a form completely satisfactory to the United States. Whether it will
                                pass at all will depend on the instructions to be received by the
                                Soviet and Chinese members, and on whether the United Kingdom
                                member, who “cannot support the paper”, will abstain on the final
                                vote. The amendments submitted by the United States in regard to
                                paragraph 2 have been rejected by the majority of the Steering
                                Committee who seem insistent on some statement which will bar the
                                Japanese representatives from engaging in “political activities”.
                                The United States may have to decide whether to veto the paper or to
                                make a concession to the views of our colleagues on the
                                Commission.</p>

                            <p>(1) No Policy Decision.</p>
                            <p>The situation would then remain as it is at present. The Japanese
                                Government, with the approval of <gloss target="#t_SCAP1"
                                    >SCAP</gloss>, would accept any desirable invitations to
                                international conferences and would seek full membership. A strong
                                opposition from many other states would be encountered. Even in
                                regard to the International Telecommunications <pb n="937"

                                10 to 5 in the Administrative Council, the issue of Japan’s
                                membership cannot be said to be settled. Some of the British
                                Commonwealth members in the <gloss target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> have
                                stated that the issue may be submitted to the plenary session of the
                                Union at its next meeting. Without a favorable <gloss
                                    target="#t_FEC1">FEC</gloss> policy decision Japan’s membership
                                in an international conference will remain possible but difficult
                                and a matter of friction with some of the states which we regard as
                                our best friends.</p>
                            <p>(2) A United States Interim Directive.</p>
                            <p>By an interim directive the United States Government would direct
                                    <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss> to permit the Japanese
                                Government to accept invitations to international conferences. The
                                ultimate authority would come from the United States rather than
                                from <gloss target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>, as at present. It is
                                difficult to foresee what the effect of an interim directive would
                                be upon the other states composing an international organization
                                which Japan wished to join. Since the authority to issue an interim
                                directive comes from the Terms of Reference of the Far Eastern
                                Commission, other states might give more weight to such a directive
                                than to an authorization derived solely from <gloss
                                    target="#t_SCAP1">SCAP</gloss>. On the other hand, if the
                                interim directive should appear to be a procedure by which the
                                United States attempted to disregard the Far Eastern Commission, it
                                might strengthen the opposition of other states.</p>
                            <p>(3) A compromise by the United States.</p>
                            <p>The United States might accept paragraph 2 in some form which would
                                be agreeable to the other states on the Far Eastern Commission. If
                                the United States should decide to take this action, the first step
                                would seem to be to ascertain by informal conference whether there
                                may be any wording for the paragraph which would be mutually
                                satisfactory to the United States and the other states on the
                                Commission. If the other members should be insistent on some wording
                                which would constitute a bar against “political activities” by the
                                Japanese representatives to technical conferences, then the United
                                States would state that, upon reconsideration and in deference to
                                the views of the other members, it would accept the substance of the
                                present paragraph 2 which forbids “political activities” by
                                Japanese. The United States, further, might present a statement to
                                be read to the Steering Committee or the Commission which would
                                clarify and somewhat restrict the normal meaning of “political
                                activities”.</p>

                                    USSR and has honor to refer to fol statement contained in
                                    Potsdam Declaration, issued July 26, 1945 by heads of Govts of
                                    US, Great Britain and China, and subsequently subscribed to by
                                    SovGov: ‘The Jap military forces, after being completely
                                    disarmed shall be permitted to return to their homes with
                                    opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.’</p>
                                <p>“From outset of occupation of Japan, Supreme Commander for Allied
                                    Powers instituted a program for repatriation of many millions of
                                    Jap from areas abroad. Excellent cooperation was forthcoming
                                    from authorities of Australia, China, France, Netherlands, New
                                    Zealand, Philippine Republic, UK and US, so that entire program
                                    with single exception noted below virtually completed during
                                    1947. Exception relates to USSR which, many months after
                                    repatriation of Japs from other areas had been completed, still
                                    held several hundreds of thousands of Japs in detainment.</p>
                                <p>“On May 20, 1949 a Sov statement reported by Tass News Agency
                                    declared at that time there was total 95,000 Jap prisoners in
                                    Sov-held territories remaining to be repatriated their homeland.
                                    This figure did not account for additional 376,929 Jap who,
                                    according to figures compiled by JapGov, were then, and still
                                    are, held in areas under Sov control.</p>
                                <p>“This discrepancy in no [<hi rend="italic">number</hi>]
                                    unrepatriated Jap is too wide to be attributed clerical error or
                                    oversight. At same time, repatriation results from all other
                                    areas have uniformly attested to substantial reliability of
                                    JapGov statistics pertaining to Japs to be returned from those
                                    areas. JapGov’s statistics relating to Japs detained in Sov-held
                                    areas further supported by letters from Siberia and by
                                    interviews with many hundreds of repatriates.</p>
                                <p>“Supposition therefore arises that discrepancy in question may
                                    only be explained by continued detention of large numbers of
                                    Japs in Sov-controlled areas and/or by abormally high death
                                    factor among those who were to be repatriated. As to latter

                            <p>On January 5, 1949, President Truman issued confidential Executive
                                Order No. 10026–A (895.50 Recovery/1–549), effective January 1,

                            <p>Dr. Chough called by appointment this afternoon to pay his farewell
                                visit prior to relinquishing his post in Washington and returning to
                                Korea. He stated at the outset that he regarded the favorable action
                                of the General Assembly at its recent session and the consequent
                                full <pb n="941" xml:id="pg_941" facs="0355"/>recognition of his
                                Government by the United States as highly auspicious and favorable
                                developments for his Government. He said, however, that he was very
                                much concerned by developments in China and by the prospect that
                                south Korea might soon find itself surrounded by a solidly Communist
                                continent of Asia. He said that he could not help fearing that, in
                                such an eventuality, some rash members of the Korean National
                                Assembly, prompted by the view that they should make their peace
                                with the Communists while the making was good, might propose that
                                south Korea agree to unification with north Korea on terms laid down
                                by the latter.</p>
                            <p>I said that I regarded it as highly important in the present
                                situation that the Korean Government remain strong and unified and
                                that personal differences of opinion within the Government be
                                subordinated to the national interest. I said that I also felt that
                                it was essential that the new Korean Government avoid the mistake of
                                becoming static and anti-progressive, and thereby losing the support
                                of the people. I drew an analogy to the situation in China and
                                pointed out that perhaps the greatest source of weakness in the
                                Nationalist Government in China arose from its having made just that
                                mistake. I added that the static character of the Nationalist
                                Government and its failure to accommodate itself to the developing
                                needs of the Chinese people had alienated the support of many
                                Chinese who were in no sense of the word Communists.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Chough said that he entirely agreed in theory with what I had
                                said but that he wished to point out that an enlightened and
                                progressive policy such as I had mentioned might well be a luxury
                                which could not be afforded by a government fighting for its very
                                existence. I agreed but pointed out that the Korean Government, by
                                following a dynamic rather than a static policy now, might well
                                succeed in avoiding a situation in which it would be forced to fight
                                for its very existence.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Chough stated that he would take my views back with him to Korea
                                and would keep what I had said seriously in mind.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion I said that Mr. Lovett<note n="1" xml:id="d190fn1"
                                    >Robert A. Lovett, Under Secretary of State.</note> had asked me
                                to express his regret that he had been deprived of the opportunity
                                of seeing Dr. Chough prior to the latter’s departure. Dr. Chough
                                said that he too was sorry and that he regretted also not having
                                been able to see Secretary Marshall.</p>

                                    <p>“A United States Force retained in Korea for an indeterminate
                                        period should, by its presence, act as a deterrent to
                                        external aggression and internal subversion and contribute
                                        moral support and stability to the Government of the
                                        Republic of Korea. This force is symbolic of the sponsoring
                                        powers determination to insure the continued existence and
                                        progressive development of a newly elected and inexperienced
                                        government invested with the popular will of its people.
                                        Maintenance internal order should be left to Korean security
                                        forces who should be impressed with full weight of their
                                        responsibilities, and no involvement of United States Forces
                                        therein should be authorized except on higher authority. It
                                        is hoped Korean security forces, with assistance of United
                                        States training and equipment and backed by mere presence
                                        United States Troops, would in addition to maintaining
                                        internal order be able effectively to cope with any
                                        attempted invasion. It must be borne in mind, however, that
                                        so long as United States retains a tactical military force
                                        in that area, ultimate responsibility for defense of Korea
                                        south of 38 parallel will continue to fall on United States.
                                        This force should therefore be prepared, in event of extreme
                                        emergency involving demonstrated inadequacy of Korean
                                        security forces, to take appropriate action to repel attack
                                        by external hostile forces, such action to be taken upon
                                        direction by higher authority unless time and exigencies of
                                        the situation will not permit delay.…” (740.00119 Control

                                country. In this connection, it will be noted from paragraph 1 of
                                Part II of the telegram at Tab A that <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1"
                                    >CINCFE</gloss> interprets the basic occupation mission under

                                membership in the United Nations. At its 423rd meeting, on April 8,
                                the United Nations Security Council voted 9 (including the United
                                States) to 2 in favor of a resolution recommending to the General
                                Assembly the admission of the Republic of Korea, but the resolution
                                failed of adoption because of the negative vote of the Soviet Union,
                                one of the permanent members of the Security Council. (See U.N

                                1948, has subsequently taken such action, other developments have in
                                the meantime served to underline the grave risks which the United

                                Ambassador Muccio recommended the postponement of final troop
                                withdrawal for “several months” on the basis of his belief that

                                were received from the Korean Government requesting that the United

                                forces from Korea in accordance with the terms of the Resolution of
                                December 12, 1948, it believes, in the light of the considerations
                                set forth above, that such a decision should not be made until after
                                a careful reconsideration of the entire question of the position of

                                    <p>General MacArthur felt that “the United States did not have

                                        where the Koreans would be able to cope with a full-scale

                                statement to the effect that the longer U.S. forces remain in Korea
                                the greater [the] risk of being placed in position of effecting
                                withdrawal under conditions amounting to direct pressure rather than
                                as a voluntary act. Damage in such event might well be
                                irreparable.</p>

                                Department of the Army reconsiders its proposal of 22 December and
                                recommends that a decision be made at once to complete the
                                withdrawal of our military forces on 10 May.</p>
                            <p>For administrative reasons it is extremely desirable that a firm date

                                January 25, 1949 in which you suggest that we discuss the withdrawal
                                of troops from Korea at the meeting of the National Security Council
                                on January 27.</p>
                            <p>You are, of course, aware that the Acting Secretary of State in his
                                memorandum of January 17 to Mr. Souers asked that the Council Staff
                                undertake a study of the entire Korean question. Pending exchange
                                and study of the political and military aspects of the situation
                                this Department has not yet finally formulated its position.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, while I share your views of the urgency of the matter, I
                                do not believe that it would be desirable for us to attempt to
                                discuss the question of Korea and the withdrawal of United States

                                nor do I ignore efforts which will be continued by Communists to
                                promote chaos in South Korea. Economically, long term view is as
                                bleak as ever. South Korea by itself can scarcely be made viable
                                economy even at great cost. Under existing circumstances long range

                                conflagration, they would be lost. All efforts therefore should be

                                cost of US support. Short term view is not hopeless. In this
                                economy, key immediate future lies in supply and distribution of

                                Regarding US task force, this should be retained in Korea through
                                June 1949, by which time it expected Korean security forces will be
                                sufficiently organized and trained to cope with internal subversion

                                felt that its presence was extremely valuable and that the Korean
                                Government and the people of South Korea expected great things of
                                the Commission. He went on to say that the interest of the Korean
                                Government in the proceedings at Paris, during the early part of
                                    December,<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">Reference is to Part I of
                                    the Third Session of the U.N. General Assembly.</note> was most
                                pronounced and that he felt that the mere presence of the Commission
                                here in Seoul would act as a deterrent to any armed action which the
                                Korean People’s Republic might contemplate against the South. He
                                said further that the Korean Government had been extremely gratified
                                with the position taken by the Australian Government in Paris when
                                it joined with the United States and China in sponsoring the Joint
                                Resolution, which was eventually adopted by the General
                                Assembly.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw said that the Australian Delegation felt very strongly that
                                the Commission should swing into action and not just sit here and do
                                nothing. He said that he felt that the Indian Delegate would support
                                the Australian position in its desire to have action, but that some
                                of the other delegates were inclined to be rather lackadaisical
                                about the matter. He went on to say that at the Commission’s second
                                meeting, which was scheduled for today, that he would attempt to
                                spur the Commission into positive action of some sort.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw inquired whether Mr. Muccio felt that Korea could continue
                                to exist in its present divided state without continued U.S.
                                economic aid being furnished to South Korea. Mr. Muccio said that he
                                did not believe that South Korea could possibly continue without
                                U.S. economic aid. The unusually good harvest of 1948 was more than
                                offset by the tremendous number of refugees and repatriates who had
                                    <pb n="954" xml:id="pg_954" facs="0368"/>entered South Korea
                                after 1945—that with this greater number of persons to feed, that
                                there would be little, if any, surplus of food stuffs for export
                                which might bolster up the foreign exchange position of South
                                Korea.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw asked Mr. Muccio’s opinion as to the advisability of the
                                Commission attempting to enter North Korea. Mr. Muccio said that he
                                felt very strongly that an attempt should be made, which he thought
                                would be valuable, even in case of a refusal. He said that he felt
                                it was quite possible, if properly handled, that the People’s
                                Republic would not dare to block the entrance of the Commission. Mr.
                                Muccio suggested that the Commission attempt to get into North Korea
                                by ship, and pointed out that there was fairly regular traffic
                                between Hong Kong and North Korea. He went on to say that he had
                                suggested in a cable to the Department that the Commission should
                                attempt to enter North Korea by sea. Mr. Shaw suggested that it
                                might be possible to get across the 38th parallel by jeep. Mr.
                                Muccio said he saw no objection to trying. In fact the Commission
                                might sidestep the rather knotty problem of officially informing the
                                People’s Republic of their desire to inspect North Korea and simply
                                arrive at the 38th parallel and attempt to enter without any
                                previous official <hi rend="italic">pourparlers</hi>.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw asked if there was any tendency toward fusion between the
                                economies of both North and South Korea, which would strongly
                                promote integration of the two systems. Mr. Muccio said that in his
                                opinion each was complementary to the other. Mr. Muccio went on to
                                say, in his opinion, there was considerable amount of unofficial
                                trade (smuggling) going on between the two and some official trade.
                                The U.S. Government had done all it could to encourage trade between
                                the two sections but had not been too successful—the Department of
                                Commerce of the Korean Government initially having acted in such a
                                way as to reduce official trade between the two sections to a
                                minimum. The South had sent a Korean ship, loaded with rubber and
                                cotton to North Korea—this material was to be bartered for
                                fertilizer. This ship had arrived in North Korea three weeks ago and
                                to date had not been permitted to leave.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw asked Mr. Muccio if the Korean Armed Forces were at present
                                well enough organized to prevent an armed invasion from the North.
                                Mr. Muccio indicated his belief that such was not the case. He said
                                that the basic training of the Korean Constabulary would be
                                completed by the end of March, with battalion regimental training
                                about the first of June. Mr. Muccio said that prior to Yosu,<note
                                    n="4" xml:id="d198fn4">See footnote 3, <ref target="#pg_947">p.
                                        947</ref>.</note> the Constabulary had been pretty
                                thoroughly infiltrated but that since that time the Korean
                                Government had been taking rigorous corrective action. Mr. Muccio
                                went on to say that prior to Yosu the Korean Government <pb n="955"
                                    xml:id="pg_955" facs="0369"/>and many people in South Korea
                                wished to have the U.S. Army leave immediately. Also, prior to Yosu,
                                South Korean internal politics were in a most chaotic state. The
                                events at Yosu, however, seemed to steady the South Koreans down and
                                apparently shocked them into a realization of what could happen,
                                unless they developed a certain amount of team work. As a result,
                                the friction between President Rhee and the Assembly was certainly
                                reduced while the South Korean attitude toward the U.S. underwent a
                                drastic change—from being rather unfriendly to a most friendly
                                one.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw stated that he felt that a certain amount of socialization
                                on a broad basis in South Korea would tend to give South Korea a
                                stable position. Mr. Muccio did not directly agree with this
                                statement of Mr. Shaw, but added that the U.S. Government
                                authorities had effected a substantial distribution of land to the
                                peasants last April and he felt that this, more than any other
                                single thing, had a very beneficial effect on South Korean politics.
                                He called Mr. Shaw’s attention to the greatly increased number of
                                children in school, there being five times as many as there were at
                                any time during the period of Japanese control. Mr. Muccio said that
                                he felt that, under the circumstances, the Korean Government had
                                done a very good job of holding itself together and getting things
                                done—that, in view of the fact that it really had been operating on
                                its own for only about two months, it had done a good job in the
                                face of great difficulties.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw asked Mr. Muccio if he had much information on what was
                                going on in North Korea. Mr. Muccio said that we really did not have
                                very much to go on, we had a general idea that the North was pretty
                                well depopulated with people refugeeing to the South and other
                                Koreans being sent to Russia. He said that the Russians had taken
                                out tremendous stocks of supplies as well as considerable amounts of
                                machinery.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Shaw said that the first meeting of the Commission, which was
                                held on February 2nd, took up matters of procedure only and that, as
                                he had stated previously, he intended to try to get some action at
                                the Commission’s meeting which was taking place at eleven o’clock
                                today.</p>
                            <p>(Mr. Jamieson entered the room at this point).</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio asked Mr. Shaw and Mr. Jamieson if they were satisfied
                                with their quarters. Mr. Shaw said that they were not “too flossy”
                                but that he really couldn’t complain.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio invited both Mr. Shaw and Mr. Jamieson to the luncheon
                                which he was holding in honor of Secretary Royall on February
                                    8th.<note n="5" xml:id="d198fn5">Mr. Royall visited Korea as

                            <p>At the request of President Rhee, Mr. Muccio and I conferred with the
                                President this afternoon. He stated that, in an effort to avoid an
                                open conflict on the 38th Parallel, the police rather than the
                                constabulary were stationed along the line. As a result of the
                                police being armed only with carbines, they were easy targets for
                                the North Koreans who had rifles; and many police had been killed by
                                rifle fire. He stated that a Colonel Price<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d199fn2">Col. Terrill E. Price had been Advisor to the

                                    1946, to May 20, 1948; see Sawyer, <hi rend="italic">Military
                                        Advisors in Korea</hi>, pp. 20–22, 31.</note> had made the
                                decision for the police not to have rifles on the frontier. At the
                                time he (Rhee) understood the reason for it, but it turned out to be
                                a mistake. He stated he would like the police to have enough rifles
                                to keep 18–20 thousand on the northern border supplied with rifles
                                and ammunition. (I understand they have a few machine guns or
                                automatic rifles.)</p>
                            <p>Rhee further said that none of the disturbances which had been given
                                so much publicity were alarming to him.</p>
                            <p>He stated that he had said some months ago that, with sufficient
                                equipment, the Southern Korean Army could be increased by 100,000
                                within six weeks; that he had not publicly given the reason for the
                                statement, but that the reason was that there were between 150,000
                                to 200,000 Southern Koreans, not now in the Army, who had
                                considerable combat experience with the Japanese or with the
                                Chinese, and that most of them would like to come into the Army, and
                                that he would have no trouble in raising 100,000 trained soldiers
                                immediately.</p>
                            <p>He stated that he had discussed their use with General Coulter,<note
                                    n="3" xml:id="d199fn3">Maj. Gen. John B. Coulter was Commanding
                                    General, U.S. Army Forces in Korea from August 27, 1948, to
                                    January 15, 1949; see <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 34–35,
                                    37.</note> and that General Coulter had expressed some doubts
                                about use of former Japanese soldiers because of American sentiment
                                against it. Coulter had also said that use of ex-Japanese soldiers
                                would create a morale factor with the Korean troops who had been
                                hostile to the Japanese. <pb n="957" xml:id="pg_957" facs="0371"
                                />General Coulter further thought that it would be bad to put the
                                ex-Japanese or the ex-Chinese soldiers in separate units. The
                                President admitted that soldiers who had fought with the Chinese and
                                soldiers who had fought with the Japanese might have some hostility
                                toward each other, but he felt that by the general distribution
                                within the Army that no real problem would be raised.</p>
                            <p>The President also stated that the police were well trained
                                militarily and were in his opinion almost ready to supplement the
                                army as soldiers.</p>
                            <p>As to the morale of his army, the President stated the North Koreans
                                had a much greater morale problem than the Southern Koreans, and
                                that he believed that if North Korea were invaded by South Korea, a
                                large proportion of the North Korean Army would desert to the South
                                Korean Army. When asked why he thought so, he said that the North
                                Koreans actually knew how Communism was working and many were
                                hostile to it, while the Communist sympathisers among the Southern
                                Koreans based their sympathy not on knowledge but on propaganda.</p>
                            <p>He said he would like to increase the Army, provide equipment and
                                arms for it, and then in a short time move north into North Korea.
                                He said that the United Nations’ recognition of South Korea made it
                                legal to cover all Korea and that he saw nothing could be gained by
                                waiting. The Ambassador injected the thought that in his (the
                                Ambassador’s) opinion no such action should be taken certainly until
                                there was an opportunity to work matters out peacefully with North
                                Korea, as to which the Ambassador had some hope.</p>
                            <p>I told the President that, of course, no invasion of North Korea
                                could in any event take place while the United States had combat
                                troops in Korea, and that his suggestion was in my opinion
                                tantamount to a request that we should have all American combat
                                troops removed. The President stated that, if we would increase the
                                Advisory Mission to a reasonable extent and put in charge of it an
                                experienced military man who would instill confidence into the
                                Koreans, and exert influence on the possible enemy, and if we would
                                agree to provide a reasonable amount of additional arms, he would
                                have no objection to us getting out at once.</p>
                            <p>He called to my attention the fact that a resolution had been
                                introduced in the Korean Assembly a few days ago, with signatures of
                                75 members, asking for all foreign troops to be withdrawn, and that
                                he and his cabinet had worked against the resolution largely
                                because, with the Russians already out, it would be a criticism of
                                the United States; and that by dint of hard work the resolution was
                                defeated 106 to 32, with a number abstaining from voting.</p>

                            <p>The President stated that one of the principal difficulties of the
                                entire Korean<note n="*" xml:id="d199fn4">Mr. Muccio’s recollection
                                    is that President Rhee’s reference at this point was to the
                                    entire Far Eastern, rather than just the Korean, situation, a
                                    recollection borne out by the context of this paragraph.
                                    [Footnote in the source text.]</note> situation was the
                                vacillation of the U.S. State Department, which vacillation he
                                thought that had played a strong part in the loss of China, and
                                might be seriously harmful in Korea. I told him that I thought he
                                was quite unjust to the State Department, that every country was
                                inclined to consider only their own particular problem, which in
                                comparison with world affairs might be minor; but the State
                                Department had to deal with the entire global situation as it
                                affected America and world peace and had to make decisions from time
                                to time on that basis, and that while I knew of no change in Korean
                                policy, the world wide situation, which was not always static,
                                sometimes required a change in policy as to a particular country. He
                                stated that he understood what I said, and hoped that I did not feel
                                that he had spoken improperly.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that if we are going to capitalize as much as possible
                                on the Russian withdrawal from Korea as one of the reasons or
                                occasions for our withdrawal, we ought to withdraw promptly. I
                                certainly do not feel we should wait until 10 May.</p>

                                <p>In reply to Secretary Royall’s inquiry, I explained that the
                                    State Department had not yet defined its position on the
                                    question of withdrawal. Secretary Royall stated that he was for
                                    immediate withdrawal of the task forces and that President Rhee
                                    had agreed thereto. I recalled that, at our meeting in Seoul,
                                    President Rhee eloquently pleaded for more arms and equipment.
                                    Secretary Royall then pointedly asked if we should increase the
                                    advisory mission and if we should provide a reasonable amount of
                                    additional arms, would he object to the immediate withdrawal of
                                    the U.S. forces. To this President Rhee hardly said “yes” and
                                    hardly said “no”. Therefore, the phrase in the Secretary’s
                                    “Memorandum of Conversation”, dated February 8, 1949, <pb
                                        n="959" xml:id="pg_959" facs="0373"/>that President Rhee
                                    “would have no objection to us getting out at once”, in my
                                    recollection, is somewhat too specific.</p>
                                <p>As regards my personal position, I replied that it was still as
                                    outlined at the time of the Secretary’s visit to Korea. The best
                                    target date for the completion of withdrawal appears to be June
                                    30, 1949 provided basic training of the Korean Army is completed
                                    as scheduled (March 31 for new enlistees and June 30 at
                                    battalion and regimental level) and arrangements are completed
                                    in the meantime to leave the Korean security forces with an
                                    adequate amount of arms, equipment and munitions. I added that
                                    the U.S. should not make any unilateral announcement as to its
                                    intention regarding withdrawal until the United Nations
                                    Commission, just arrived in Korea, has had time to appraise the
                                    situation and submit its report to the General Assembly, as
                                    called for in the Resolution of December 12, 1948. In other
                                    words, I feel that we should aim at June 30th and should review
                                    the situation in a few months, say the beginning of May.</p>
                                <p>Two other matters were discussed. I mentioned that in the course
                                    of the conversation at Seoul, President Rhee had promised that
                                    he would refrain from any action that might embarrass the U.S.
                                    position in the Far East and that he would not take any
                                    offensive military action against north Korea that might
                                    possibly embroil the U.S. forces there. This promise is so
                                    significant that it should be a matter of record. I also took
                                    occasion to clarify the allegation made by President Rhee that
                                    General Coulter had expressed doubt about the use of former
                                    Japanese soldiers because of American sentiment against it. I
                                    pointed out that several times President Rhee had pleaded for
                                    arms to equip “special” groups (one plea was for arms for some
                                    20,000 as Japanese veterans that a Colonel Kim Wan Soo (?) had
                                    convinced Rhee were champing at the bit to defend the
                                    fatherland). General Coulter never told President Rhee not to
                                    use Japanese or Chinese trained Koreans. General Coulter and I
                                    consistently urged that such super-patriots be included in the
                                    regular Korean Army and not organized as special units. We
                                    always stressed the need of a unified Army loyal to the Korean
                                    Government and not rival units looking up to individual
                                    leaders.</p>
                                <p>Secretary Royall suggested that the points raised here be
                                    attached to his “Memorandum of Conversation” dated February 8,
                                    1949.</p>

                                II Sung or his Soviet masters. If latter leaders should entertain
                                such divergent views, they could be expected to become known to

                                these efforts and activities North Koreans, are as we view
                                situation, largely abject tools of Russians. In our opinion, any
                                advocacy by North Korean leaders of peaceful means of obtaining
                                Korean unity would only be tolerated by Soviet masters if latter
                                felt such means best calculated to accomplish Soviet aims. Record to
                                date suggests Soviets and their North Korean stooges unwilling have

                            <p>164. In course informal conversation this morning, Wertheimer,
                                principal secretary <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>, sounded
                                us out confidentially on desirability and practicability of sending
                                foreign military observers to Korea to carry out much same functions
                                as those performed by military observers attached Balkan and Kashmir
                                commissions. In broaching subject, Wertheimer was careful to point
                                out proposal had not been submitted to <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss> or discussed in its deliberations to date.</p>
                            <p>2. We replied we had no instructions or information regarding
                                attitude our government on this subject and must therefore confine
                                ourselves to expressions of personal and informal views. Within this
                                framework, we expressed view that if <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss> decided in light its investigations situation to
                                recommend despatch foreign military observers, we doubted our
                                government would oppose such recommendation and might in fact
                                positively support it. We then observed if US and Soviet troops were
                                withdrawn, with unity not yet achieved between north and south,
                                presence of such foreign observers might introduce stabilizing
                                element and possibly contribute to prevention of all-out civil war.
                                We then suggested that if proposal were indeed discussed by <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>, it seemed to us Korean
                                Government should be invited to express its views at some
                                appropriate juncture.</p>
                            <p>3. In concluding conversation, Wertheimer specifically requested we
                                endeavor seek US Government’s views on despatch of foreign observers
                                to Korea. We merely replied we would convey his request to
                                Department for its consideration.</p>

                            <p>During the course of an extended call on President Rhee the afternoon
                                of February 22, 1949, in which the <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> program of Korea was the main topic of
                                conversation, Mr. Drumright took the opportunity to bring up with
                                President Rhee the question of relations between the Korean
                                Government and the United Nations Commission on Korea, with
                                particular reference to <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>
                                contact with non-official Korean individuals and organizations. Mr.
                                Drumright explained that he was taking up this subject in a personal
                                capacity and that his aim was the betterment of relations between
                                the Korean Government and <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>.
                                Mr. Drumright then said he had been told by members of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> that contact with Koreans of
                                non-governmental status had been severely restricted, and that in
                                fact Commission delegates had seen virtually no Koreans other than
                                those with an official status. Mr. Drumright said that he could not
                                vouch for the accuracy of the information supplied him, but if it
                                were true he felt that it might give <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss> wrong impressions of Korea and perhaps impair
                                relations between the Korean Government and the Commission. Mr.
                                Drumright said he wondered, therefore, whether the complaints
                                adduced by <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> delegates could
                                not in some way be eliminated.</p>
                            <p>President Rhee said that the Government of the Republic of Korea was
                                still new and still in the process of organization. He said that the
                                Government was beset by the widespread subversive activities of the
                                Communist underground, and that the situation was still serious.
                                President Rhee then went into a discourse of the opposition factions
                                which culminated in the North–South conference in the spring of
                                    1948.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">The conference was held on
                                    April 22 and 23, 1948; see <ref target="frus1948v06#pg_1162">

                                said that the activities of these factions did irreparable harm to
                                the cause of Korean unity and he did not wish them repeated before
                                the new Commission. He then suggested that certain opposition
                                elements in South Korea would like to bring about a split in much
                                the same way as it had occurred in 1948. He was therefore anxious,
                                he said, to have the Commission avoid being pulled around by various
                                political factions in opposition to the Government in South Korea.
                                President <pb n="965" xml:id="pg_965" facs="0379"/>Rhee also
                                intimated that it would be no use trying to bring about any
                                coalition between the Korean Government and the Communist faction in
                                the North, pointing out the disastrous consequences of such attempts
                                in China.</p>
                            <p>President Rhee said that it was not his intention that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> delegates be isolated from
                                outside contact, however, and that the screening of visitors wishing
                                to see the delegates had been adopted for their protection. If
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> did not desire such
                                police protection, he went on, the Korean Government would be glad
                                to have the police withdrawn.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Drumright said he realized that there was a real problem of
                                police protection, as well as a problem of working out a
                                satisfactory procedure so that Koreans of various kinds with
                                legitimate reasons for seeing Commission delegates might be
                                admitted. Mr. Drumright went on to say he had informally advised
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> delegates to observe
                                closely conditions in South Korea, that it would be well if they
                                went periodically to the National Assembly, if they had long
                                consultations with Government officials, and if they were to travel
                                throughout the South Korean provinces. Mr. Drumright added it was
                                his opinion that the Republic of Korea really had nothing to hide
                                from the Commission and that it would be much better all around if
                                the Commission members could be given access to all sorts of people
                                and given facilities for observation and consultation. Mr. Drumright
                                said further he was of the opinion that the UN members were for the
                                most part men of more than ordinary intelligence and that if given
                                maximum facilities for observation and consultation they could be
                                counted on to come up with accurate conclusions as to the situation
                                in Korea.</p>
                            <p>President Rhee assured Mr. Drumright it was his wish that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> delegates be given every
                                facility for observation and consultation within the domain of the
                                Republic of Korea. Indeed the Commission was being invited to the
                                National Assembly on the 23rd, and it would be given many other
                                facilities for observation. His only concern, President Rhee
                                repeated, was that members of the <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss> not be misled by Communist elements, and that the

                                tend to undermine the Government of the Republic of Korea, or give
                                the Communists ammunition for their propaganda mill.<note n="3"

                                    advised the Department of the departure for the United States of
                                    Dr. Chough to be the Korean observer at the United Nations
                                    (501.BA/2–2149).</note> In conversations yesterday evening and
                                again this morning President Rhee stated he had instructed Chough
                                Pyung Ok take up with US authorities, as “side issue” to his primary
                                mission to UN, question of additional arms and equipment for Korean
                                security forces. In describing Chough’s supplementary mission, Rhee
                                expressed regret matter had leaked to press and published accounts
                                had appeared US press (Chough and not Rhee was evidently source of
                                leak).</p>
                            <p>Rhee has for some time been persuaded by his military and police
                                advisors Korea needs augmented security forces and has made various
                                approaches, apart from present one, for additional arms and
                                equipment. As Rhee explains it, with larger and better equipped
                                security forces not only would prospect North Korean invasion South
                                Korea diminish to vanishing point but chances North Korean security
                                forces revolting against Soviet masters (which Rhee has been led by
                                his advisors to expect) would be increased. Rhee manifestly
                                envisages absorption North Korea in Republic of Korea (as evidenced
                                by recent appointment governors 5 northern provinces and various
                                expressions of view regarding mission <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss>). In our opinion, considering his record as
                                ardent patriot and long time revolutionary, this attitude on part
                                Rhee understandable though perhaps fraught with danger.</p>

                                to following points: (1) We understood Korean aid question including
                                military assistance, now being reviewed Washington; and (2) Arms and
                                equipment presently available, with some exceptions (such as
                                establishment small arms plant and improved naval craft), appeared
                                adequate for present security requirements. We also suggested Korean
                                security forces could best be used at present in suppressing
                                Communist raiders in South Korea and on Cheju Island.</p>

                                Furthermore, it is consistent with our view that Korean problem is

                            <p>A more immediate objective is the withdrawal of remaining U.S.
                                occupation forces from Korea as early as practicable consistent with
                                the foregoing objectives.</p>
                            <p>(2) In <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 8 it was concluded that
                                “it should be the effort of the U.S. Government through all proper
                                means to effect a settlement of the Korean problem which would
                                enable the U.S. to withdraw from Korea as soon as possible with the
                                minimum of bad effects”. As a means to that end, it was further
                                concluded in that paper that, following the anticipated
                                establishment of a government in south Korea, the U.S. should
                                undertake “within practicable and feasible limits” a program of
                                support of that government, including the extension of economic aid
                                and the training and equipping of native armed forces “capable of
                                protecting the security of south Korea against any but an overt act
                                of aggression by north Korean or other forces”. With respect to the
                                withdrawal of occupation forces, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                8 stipulated that the U.S. should be prepared to proceed with the
                                implementation of withdrawal following the formation of a government
                                in south Korea, and that such withdrawal should be phased in
                                consonance with the accomplishment of the broad objectives of the
                                U.S. in Korea and with the relevant commitments of the U.S.
                                vis-à-vis the UN, every effort being made, however, to create
                                conditions for the withdrawal of such forces by December 31,

                                responsibility as an occupying Power, intended to carry on
                                negotiations with the Korean Government, in consultation with the
                                Temporary Commission, relating to the further provisions of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> Resolution concerning the
                                constitution by the new Government of its own security forces, the

                                withdrawal of occupation forces. Pursuant to its annunced intention,
                                the U.S. on August 15, 1948 terminated Military Government and
                                commenced the transfer of the functions of government to the
                                Government of the Republic of Korea, which was formally inaugurated
                                on that date. The assumption of these functions by the new
                                Government was completed in December 1948.</p>
                            <p>(2) Although the reduction of U.S. military forces in Korea through
                                the implementation of existing withdrawal plans was begun on
                                September 15, 1948, subsequent developments in the Korean situation
                                forced a revision of the plan to complete the withdrawal of such
                                forces by December 31, 1948. This revision was necessitated in the
                                first instance by the fact that the <gloss target="#t_GA1"
                                    >GA</gloss> did not complete its consideration of the Korean
                                problem until December 12, 1948. Of equal importance, however, was
                                the fact that in the meantime there were other developments which
                                served to underline the grave risks which the U.S. would incur in
                                completing the withdrawal of its forces from Korea as originally
                                scheduled. On November 12, 1948 the U.S. Special Representative in
                                Korea recommended the postponement of final troop withdrawal for
                                “several months” on the basis of his belief that “under existing
                                conditions only Army presence guarantees minimum Korean external and
                                internal security which is indispensable for any attack [on] basic
                                policy and economic problems and for successful economic <pb n="972"
                                    xml:id="pg_972" facs="0386"/>rehabilitation”. Concurrently,
                                official representations were received from the Korean Government
                                requesting that the U.S. retain an occupation force in Korea “for
                                the time being”. Implicit in both of these developments was a
                                recognition of the fact that conditions of stability and public
                                order in south Korea were still not such as to give assurance that
                                the Government of the Republic of Korea, with the means available to
                                it, could withstand on its own a serious and sustained challenge to
                                its authority through external aggression or externally-inspired
                                insurrection.</p>
                            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, a U.S. Army force of
                                approximately 7,500 men has been retained in Korea pending a
                                definitive decision with respect to final troop withdrawal.</p>
                            <p>(3) Concurrently with the foregoing developments, Soviet occupation
                                authorities in north Korea, after refusing to permit the UN
                                Temporary Commission on Korea to visit that area, conducted
                                “elections” and established and accorded recognition to a puppet
                                “Democratic People’s Republic”, all in flagrant disregard of the
                                clearly expressed will of the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> as
                                expressed in the Resolution of November 14, 1947. On December 25,
                                1948 the Soviet Government announced that it had completed the

                                Soviet bloc, which approved the report of the Temporary Commission
                                and declared “that there has been established a lawful government
                                (the Government of the Republic of Korea), having effective control
                                and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the Temporary
                                Commission was able to observe and consult and in which the great
                                majority of the people of all Korea reside; that this Government is
                                based on elections which were a valid expression of the free will of
                                the electorate of that part of Korea and which were observed by the
                                Temporary Commission; and that this is the only such Government in
                                Korea”. This Resolution made provision for the establishment of a
                                reconstituted seven-nation UN Commission on Korea whose principal
                                functions would be to work for the unification of Korea and the

                                forth in the resolution of November 14, 1947”. On the question of
                                troop withdrawal the Resolution of December 12 recommended “that the

                                An agreement establishing the basis for U.S. economic aid to Korea
                                was signed by representatives of the two Governments on December 10,
                                1948, and approved by the Korean National Assembly three days

                            <p>Even with U.S. economic assistance there is no assurance that south
                                Korea can be made economically self-sufficient so long as the
                                peninsula remains truncated.</p>
                            <p>(6) The approximate present total strength of the U.S.-trained and
                                -equipped security forces of the Republic of Korea is 114,000,
                                divided as follows: 65,000 Army (formerly Constabulary), 45,000
                                Police, and 4,000 Coast Guard. The Army is presently fully equipped
                                to a level of 50,000 with U.S. infantry type materiel. Approximately
                                one-half of the Police and Coast Guard personnel are equipped with
                                U.S. side arms or carbines of various types, while the remainder
                                have Japanese equipment of similar types. These unite also have a
                                limited number of U.S. and Japanese machine guns. The Coast Guard
                                particularly is lacking in such essential equipment as patrol boats
                                and other craft necessary to enable it to prevent infiltration by
                                sea along the extensive Korean coastline, or to provide water
                                transport for the movement of security forces into troubled areas.
                                Although the Korean Government is eager to build an air force, U.S.
                                supplies for this purpose have been limited to twelve observation
                                type aircraft. The present Army training schedule calls for the
                                completion of training up to the regimental level by June 1,
                                1949.</p>

                            <p>The effective maintenance of these security forces is and will
                                continue for the foreseeable future to be wholly dependent upon
                                military, economic, and technical assistance from the U.S.</p>
                            <p>(7) Although Soviet occupation forces as such are believed in fact to
                                have been withdrawn from north Korea as announced by the Soviet
                                Government, they have left behind a well-organized “People’s Army”,
                                officered in part by Soviet-citizen Koreans who formerly served in
                                the Red Army, and advised by Red Army personnel attached to the
                                Soviet “Embassy” in north Korea. The strength of the north Korean
                                Army and security forces is estimated at from 75,000 to 95,000. The
                                most recent (February 3) estimate of the hard core of these forces,
                                the North Korean People’s Army, fixes its strength as 56,040.
                                Special border constabulary, police, railway guards, and other
                                security forces are estimated to total at least another 30,000. In
                                Manchuria, furthermore, there are reported to be other Korean units
                                in service with Chinese Communist forces or in training that equal
                                or exceed the combined army and security forces now in north Korea.
                                The North Korean People’s Army is reported to be equipped
                                principally with Soviet weapons and materiel, with emphasis on
                                infantry mortars and automatic weapons. Small numbers of fighter and
                                reconnaissance aircraft were reportedly transferred to north Korea
                                early in 1948 by Soviet forces.</p>

                                U.S. policy in Korea: (1) The persistent refusal of the USSR to
                                cooperate in good faith with the U.S. in formulating a just and
                                mutually acceptable solution to the Korean problem, and its further
                                refusal to collaborate with the UN in its efforts to bring about the
                                creation of a united and independent Korea, have made inescapable
                                the conclusion that the predominant aim of Soviet policy in Korea is
                                to achieve eventual Soviet domination of the entire country. A
                                derivative objective of Soviet policy has been to establish in the
                                Soviet zone of occupation a politically “dependable” puppet
                                government which can be used as a vehicle for the eventual extension
                                of Soviet control throughout the Korean peninsula. As noted above,
                                the Soviet occupation authorities, in pursuance of these objectives
                                and in flagrant disregard of the will of the UN, have established
                                and recognized a puppet “Democratic People’s Republic” in north
                                Korea, supported by a Soviet-trained and -equipped “People’s Army”.
                                Despite reports of divergences among the north Korean leadership, it
                                is the opinion of the American Mission in Korea that the “Soviets
                                have fashioned their north Korean creature in typical Communist
                                monolithic disciplined mould and in the circumstances there is
                                virtually no scope for deviations from Soviet desiderata, however
                                minute these may be”. The USSR has been assisted in its efforts in
                                north Korea by the natural advantages which accrue from geographical
                                    <pb n="975" xml:id="pg_975" facs="0389"/>proximity, as well as
                                by the added advantage of having available the services of a
                                considerable number of Sovietized Koreans who, by virtue of years
                                spent during the Japanese occupation of Korea in political exile in
                                the Soviet Union, have emerged as a ready-made fifth column.</p>
                            <p>(2) The extension of Soviet-backed Communist control throughout all
                                of Korea would enhance the political and strategic position of the
                                USSR with respect to both China and Japan and adversely affect the
                                position of the U.S. in those areas and throughout the Far East. In
                                the light of the disruptive pressures, both internal and external,
                                to which the new Korean Government is subjected at present, abrupt
                                and complete U.S. disengagement could be expected to lead directly
                                to that result. Such disengagement would be interpreted as a
                                betrayal by the U.S. of its friends and allies in the Far East and
                                might contribute substantially to a fundamental realignment of
                                forces in favor of the USSR throughout that part of the world. The
                                overthrow by Soviet-dominated forces of a government established in
                                south Korea under the aegis of the UN would, moreover, constitute a
                                severe blow to the prestige and influence of the latter; in this
                                respect the interests of the U.S. must be regarded as parallel to,
                                if not identical with, those of the UN.</p>
                            <p>(3) In the face of this situation, the U.S. has been presented with
                                three possible courses of action: (a) to abandon Korea to Communist
                                domination, a course of action which, as indicated above, would do
                                violence to the spirit of every international commitment undertaken
                                by the U.S. during and since the war with respect to Korea and which
                                might damage irreparably American prestige and influence throughout
                                the Far East; (b) to go to the other extreme and guarantee
                                unconditionally the political independence and territorial integrity
                                of south Korea, by force of arms if necessary, a course of action
                                which would commit the U.S. to continued direct political, economic
                                and military responsibility in Korea, even to the extent of risking
                                involvement in a major war in an area in which virtually all of the
                                natural advantages would accrue to the USSR; or (c) as a middle
                                course, to establish within practicable and feasible limits
                                conditions of support of the Government of the Republic of Korea as
                                a means of facilitating the reduction of the U.S. commitment of men
                                and money in Korea while at the same time minimizing to the greatest
                                practicable extent the chances of south Korea’s being brought under
                                Communist domination as a consequence of the withdrawal of U.S.
                                armed forces. Taking into consideration all factors, including the
                                judgment of the responsible military authorities that “the U.S. has
                                little strategic interest in maintaining its present troops and

                                            >SANACC</gloss> 176/38) that “the U.S. has little
                                        strategic interest in maintaining its present troops and
                                        bases in Korea.” Moreover, in the event of hostilities in
                                        the Far East, these troops would constitute a military
                                        liability. U.S. troops could not be maintained there without
                                        substantial reinforcement prior to the initiation of
                                        hostilities, but this would be militarily inadvisable since
                                        any land operations would, in all probability, bypass the

                                from the point of view of the interests of the U.S.</p>
                            <p>(2) It is clearly evident, however, that if the significant gains
                                made thus far, in terms both of the welfare and aspirations of the
                                Korean people and of the national interest of the U.S., are to be
                                consolidated, the U.S. must continue to give political support and
                                economic, technical, military, and other assistance to the
                                Government of the Republic of Korea.</p>
                            <p>(3) In as much as the early withdrawal of U.S. occupation forces from
                                Korea was established as an objective of U.S. policy in Korea in
                                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 8 and as an international
                                commitment of the U.S. in the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>
                                Resolution of December 12, 1948, it is considered desirable that
                                such assistance not be dependent upon the continued presence of
                                those forces in Korea.</p>
                            <p>(4) On the basis of presently available data, including the judgment
                                of the responsible U.S. political and military representatives in
                                the field, it is believed that the effectiveness of continuing U.S.
                                support of the Government of the Republic of Korea need not be
                                dependent upon the further retention of U.S. occupation forces in
                                Korea provided such support embraces the following measures:</p>

                            <p>(5) Although the possibility is recognized that the withdrawal of
                                U.S. occupation forces from Korea at this time, even with the
                                compensatory measures provided herein, might be followed by a major
                                    <pb n="977" xml:id="pg_977" facs="0391"/>effort on the part of
                                the Soviet-dominated north Korean regime to overthrow the Republic
                                of Korea through direct military aggression or inspired
                                insurrection, it is believed that this risk will obtain equally at
                                any time in the foreseeable future. It is understood to be the view
                                of the National Military Establishment that the mere further
                                temporary postponement of withdrawal would not serve appreciably to
                                diminish this risk, but would serve rather to perpetuate the
                                additional risk that U.S. occupation forces remaining in Korea might
                                be either destroyed or obliged to abandon Korea in the event of a
                                major hostile attack, with serious damage to U.S. prestige in either
                                case. The Commander-in-Chief, Far East, has reported that the
                                establishment of Korean security forces within the current program
                                is substantially complete and that the state of training and combat
                                readiness of these forces is such as to justify a complete
                                withdrawal of U.S. occupation forces, and has expressed the opinion
                                that troop withdrawal from Korea at this time would not adversely
                                affect the U.S. position in Japan.</p>
                            <p>(6). On the basis of the foregoing, it is understood to be the
                                judgment of the National Military Establishment and of the
                                responsible military representatives in the field that U.S.
                                occupation forces should be withdrawn from Korea by May 10,
                                1949.</p>

                                be undertaken to permit completion of the withdrawal on or about but

                                        the following observations on recent Cabinet changes:</p>
                                    <p>“New Minister Defense Sihn [Sung Mo] impresses us as man of
                                        ability and integrity. In our view his new appointment will
                                        give Rhee more effective and loyal control of security
                                        forces than had been case Lee Bum Suk. Sinn’s appointment
                                        should also bring in time better organization of army,
                                        reshuffling of top military officers to promote efficiency
                                        and lessen cliques former under Lee Bum Suk’s
                                        administration, closer cooperation between army and police,
                                        improved relations between <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"

                                    <p>“By virtue new appointment Sihn in position control both army
                                        and police. This together with fact he enjoys fullest
                                        confidence President Rhee, makes him second most powerful
                                        official in Korean Government.</p>
                                    <p>“It appears Lee Bum Suk has taken loss Defense Ministry with
                                        good grace and is prepared carry on as Prime Minister.”

                                improving gradually. Rhee remains dominant force in government and

                                reached by Government of US to furnish Korean security forces
                                adequate arms, equipment and munitions prior to withdrawal of task
                                force and that legislative authority would be sought to continue

                            <p>On April 4 I again raised question of withdrawal with Rhee. In course
                                of lengthy discussion I told him it was a natural desire of US to
                                withdraw its forces as soon as this could be done without imperiling
                                Korean security and that I felt the training of Korean security
                                forces had made such progress in recent months that withdrawal of
                                American troops might be accomplished in the very near future. Rhee
                                took this calmly, said he realized American troops could not be kept
                                in Korea indefinitely and merely expressed hope they could be
                                maintained until Republic had an adequate force to protect its
                                interests and sufficient arms and ammunitions to supply its force.

                            <p>A–127. Defense Minister Sihn Sung Mo is now on Cheju Island at
                                express request of President Rhee, with orders to remain until
                                guerrillas have been wiped out and order restored. Previously, Sihn
                                had been given similar instructions, when he was Minister of Home
                                Affairs, but was called home in order to assume portfolio of
                                defense. Just prior to his departure at the beginning of this week,
                                he stated that the clean-up would be much easier now that he was
                                working with Army assault forces instead of the less reliable and
                                more timorous police. Actually, he said, the rebels were surrounded
                                in their mountain strongholds, and could not hold out for much
                                longer.</p>
                            <p>Fighting on Cheju has been sporadic for a long time. Pyongyang radio
                                broadcasts have devoted long programs to the “celebration” of the
                                one year’s anniversary of the “partisan” fighting on the island,
                                which began on April 3 of last year. Similar broadcasts in Korean
                                from Moscow and Khabarovsk have referred to the revolt as the
                                forerunner of the widespread armed resistance which is destined to
                                sweep the country as soon as American troops have been
                                withdrawn.</p>
                            <p>It is clear from the nature of the propaganda emanating from the
                                Soviet-controlled radio that Cheju Island has been chosen as the
                                spot for a major Soviet effort to sow confusion and terror in
                                southern Korea. This has been accompanied by a continuing and
                                similar operation on the land mass of the peninsula just north of
                                the island, in the provinces of South Cholla and South Kyongsang.
                                With such conditions deep in the rear areas of the Republic,
                                President Rhee has been forced to take the decision to stamp out
                                unrest and insecurity, so that the defense forces on the 38th
                                parallel should not be lured away and dissipated in the internecine
                                struggle which the Communists have hoped to make a permanent facet
                                of the Korean scene.</p>
                            <p>It seems obvious that Soviet agents are being filtered into Cheju
                                without great difficulty. Minister Sihn states that most of them
                                arrived by small fishing boats from North Korea. While the Korean
                                Coast Guard is endeavoring to patrol the coast of the island, says
                                Sihn, it cannot possibly, with its present small complement of
                                ships, maintain a tight blockade. While it has been a subject for
                                some argument between the Prime Minister and Minister Sihn, and
                                particularly in debates on the floor of the House, there have been
                                persistent reports of Soviet ships and submarines around the
                                island.</p>

                            <p>Photographs of operations on Cheju indicate unusual sadistic
                                propensities on the part of both Government and guerrilla forces.
                                Signal atrocities have been reported, indicating mass massacre of
                                village populations, including women and children, accompanied by
                                widespread looting and arson. In some cases the Army has been guilty
                                of revenge operations against guerrillas which have brought down
                                vengeance on unarmed villagers.</p>
                            <p>A Pyongyang broadcast of last Sunday was singularly revealing as to
                                the direct interest of the puppet People’s Republic in the fighting
                                on Cheju. Textually, the following was stated:</p>

                            <p>Dr. Chough, accompanied by the Korean Ambassador, called on me today
                                at his request to discuss the question of military assistance for
                                Korea.</p>
                            <p>After the customary exchange of pleasantries Dr. Chough stated that,
                                as the Department had already been informed, he had been charged by
                                President Rhee with the mission of discussing and negotiating with
                                the U.S. Government with respect to the obtainment from the U.S. of
                                certain further military assistance regarded as essential to the
                                defense and security of his country. He reviewed the peculiar
                                circumstances <pb n="985" xml:id="pg_985" facs="0399"/>which in the
                                eyes of his Government made such assistance indispensable, remarking
                                that his Government had to be prepared for the day when U.S. troops
                                would be withdrawn. He added that his Government considered that
                                military and economic aid were inseparable parts of the same whole,
                                and that without the one the other would be unavailing.</p>
                            <p>I assured Dr. Chough that we were well aware of and actively
                                concerned with this problem and that the requirements of his
                                Government for military assistance beyond that which had already
                                been turned over had been effectively presented by Ambassador Muccio
                                during his recent period of consultation in Washington. I went on to
                                point out, however, that current demands upon the U.S. for military
                                assistance were global in scope and that the requirements of every
                                friendly country had to be examined in the light of the requirements
                                of all, and in the light of the capacity of the U.S. to meet such
                                requirements. I said that, while this would undoubtedly result in no
                                one country receiving as much as it thought it should have, it
                                should ensure a distribution of available aid according to priority
                                of need. I added that the critical nature of Korea’s requirements
                                were fully recognized by my Government and that, although no
                                specific assurances could be given to any government pending
                                approval of the program as a whole and appropriation of the
                                necessary funds by the Congress, he could be assured that his
                                country’s needs were in no way being overlooked or neglected. Dr.
                                Chough appeared satisfied with these assurances.</p>
                            <p>Referring to our previous conversation of January 5, Dr. Chough
                                stated that he had passed on to President Rhee and the Cabinet upon
                                his return to Korea the views which I had expressed concerning the
                                necessity of preventing the Korean Government, in its struggle
                                against Communism, from losing the support of the people by becoming
                                static and anti-progressive. He expressed the opinion that those
                                views had had a salutary effect in Seoul and cited the land reform
                                program currently under consideration as an example of the
                                determination of his Government to avoid the pitfalls which I had
                                mentioned.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Chang remarked that he and Dr. Chough had had several
                                conversations, on social occasions and otherwise, with Members of
                                Congress, and asked whether I saw any objection thereto. I replied
                                that we had no objection whatsoever but pointed out that it was the
                                Executive Branch of the Government which was responsible for the
                                formulation of policy and that any questions which might arise with
                                respect to U.S. policy in Korea could therefore best be discussed
                                with the Department.</p>

                                Rhee has not yet decided to issue statement referred to in mytel
                                374, April 11 [<hi rend="italic">12</hi>]. He may not have mustered
                                sufficient courage. From long discussion late yesterday, however, I
                                gathered that he is tarrying, hopeful of more concrete confirmation
                                that the US really intends to carry out assurances of military aid I
                                have given him verbally.</p>
                            <p>He rambled on, pleading for more arms and bigger army, and then
                                expressed hope for some kind of agreement by which the US would
                                guarantee Korean independence and protection in case of attack. He
                                asked me, specifically, to ascertain whether a statement might not
                                be issued in Washington that the treaty of 1883<note n="1"

                                    the United States has during the past several months effected
                                    substantial reduction of its occupation forces in Korea. Such

                                    no such withdrawal will take place without prior consultation
                                    with the Republic of Korea and the United Nations Commission on
                                    Korea. The Korean people, cognizant of the menace of armed
                                    Communist power in the north and of the inadequacy of equipment
                                    and preparation for national defense in the south, naturally
                                    feel that both their national security and their individual
                                    safety is at stake.</p>
                                <p>We will feel strong enough not to have to count on support by an
                                    American security force when we have sufficient weapons for a
                                    standing army of 65,000 men and for an armed and equipped
                                    reserve force of 200,000 men. As you know, Mr. Ambassador, we
                                    are far from having reached that point now.</p>
                                <p>You have been good enough to bring confidentially to my attention
                                    what the United States is going to do for Korea, and I feel
                                    highly encouraged by the policies adopted by the Government of
                                    the United <pb n="991" xml:id="pg_991" facs="0405"/>States and
                                    signed by the President. There is, of course, no question in my
                                    mind as to the sincerity of the United States officials in their
                                    intention of carrying out these plans. Rather, there is the
                                    practical question that the United States, being a democracy,
                                    cannot carry out any policies except as they are understood and
                                    supported by public opinion. It is for this reason that
                                    confidential assurances by Government officials, however sincere
                                    and earnest they are known to be, cannot solely be depended
                                    upon. There always remains the fundamental necessity that the
                                    public has been thoroughly informed and is fully aware of the
                                    obligation which such an understanding would place on the
                                    nation.</p>
                                <p>The American people, with their high sense of national honor and
                                    prestige, would never renounce any of their national
                                    obligations. They realize full well that the United States has
                                    committed itself concerning Korea, by various international
                                    agreements, open as well as secret, and by creation of the two
                                    occupation zones held respectively by Soviet and American
                                    troops. It has been this sequence of developments that
                                    necessitates the maintenance of a United States military force
                                    in Korea, as has been so cogently stated in an editorial in the
                                        <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of April 3, 1949.</p>
                                <p>This being the situation, it may be considered timely for the
                                    United States Government publicly to re-affirm the pledge
                                    contained in the amity clause of the Korean-American Treaty of
                                        1882.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">See telegram 246, to

                                    such an understanding is sufficiently publicized, the American
                                    people will come to know that the United States is committing
                                    itself to the extent of helping Korea whenever a predatory or
                                    aggressor nation deals unjustly with Korea, and they will know
                                    that this is done not only for the security of Korea but also
                                    for the security of the United States. Such a declaration is
                                    entirely in accord with the United States policy of collective
                                    security, as demonstrated in the Atlantic Pact.<note n="5"

                                <p>I think you will agree with me, Mr. Ambassador, that the
                                    withdrawal of American troops without such a preliminary
                                    undertaking as I have suggested would be open to serious
                                    misunderstanding in Korea, in the United States, and in other
                                    countries, and might, therefore, have disastrous consequences.
                                    The provision of arms and other military equipment in sufficient
                                    supply, and the re-affirmation by the United States of its
                                    pledge as contained in the amity clause of the 1882 Treaty will,
                                    I am confident, make any further troop support unnecessary.</p>

                                    to set an early date for the withdrawal of 8,000 U.S. troops
                                    from South Korea, President Syngman Rhee told a press
                                    conference.</p>
                                <p>Rhee said the American troops would be withdrawn during the
                                    course of the next several months. The American military
                                    mission, known as the Korean military advisory group, will
                                    remain in Korea.</p>
                                <p>The American military mission would continue to aid the training
                                    and expansion of South Korea’s 100,000–man army, which is
                                    American-trained and equipped.</p>
                                <p>Authoritative foreign observers believe this army is fully
                                    capable of meeting any challenge from the Soviet-supported North
                                    Korean People’s Army. (4/18—N954A)”</p>

                                    press. Korean opinion was generally favorable, although
                                    considerable apprehension was noted in rightist circles. Kimm
                                    Kiu-sik and Kim Koo, opposition political leaders, hailed
                                    withdrawal as a step toward peaceful unification. Meanwhile,
                                    said Mr. Muccio, the “Communists, persistent withdrawal

                                commission’s term of reference do not provide for commission
                                participation in discussions. Others have inquired what steps

                                on paragraphs 2, 3 and 4. Other paragraphs will be commented upon
                                subsequently.</p>

                            <p>1. Vessels now operated by Korean Coast Guard comprised principally
                                of 16 former US Navy <gloss target="#t_YMS1">YMS</gloss> and 11
                                former Jap mine layers all in various states disrepair. These
                                vessels designed for mine sweeping and mine laying in protected
                                harbors and channels. Such vessels not suitable for off-shore patrol
                                duties because of slow speed (9 or 10 knots) and unseaworthiness. US
                                Navy <gloss target="#t_YMS1">YMS</gloss> were received here without
                                armament, spare engines and vessel parts and tools. Moreover for
                                more than three years no marine supplies such as paint, engine and
                                vessel parts were received. Consequently condition of vessels has
                                steadily deteriorated. In many cases wood hulls of <gloss
                                    target="#t_YMS1">YMS</gloss> have been damaged by marine borers
                                and rendered virtually useless.</p>
                            <p>2. Coast Guard responsible for prevention hostile infiltration by sea
                                and for prevention piracy, smuggling, enforcement shipping laws,
                                conducting rescue work in marine disasters, et cetera. These duties
                                necessitate patrolling of 1687 miles coastal waters, 17 major and
                                400 small islands. To perform these functions effectively Coast
                                Guard needs vessels able withstand heavy weather, possess speed of
                                15 to 19 knots, adequate fire power, easy maneuverability, adequate
                                cruising range and economy of operation.</p>
                            <p>3. I think it obvious from foregoing that Korean Coast Guard craft,
                                and that as now constituted Korean Coast Guard is absolutely
                                incapable of carrying out effectively any part of responsibility
                                assigned it—whether that be defense of South Korean coast against
                                hostile invasion or preventions of smuggling which rampant today.

                                For weakness of any one element, in this case Coast Guard, could
                                easily bring about disruption of our whole military, economic, and
                                political program. We cannot risk being penny wise and pound

                                <p>As you know, there has been in existence on a provisional basis
                                    for more than 8 months a US mil mission known as the Provisional
                                    Mil Advisory Group whose function it has been to advise and
                                    assist the Korean Govt in the development and training of its
                                    own security forces. It is the judgment of my Govt that, due in
                                    no small part to the spirit of eager cooperation which has been
                                    shown by the Korean Govt and its responsible officials, the work
                                    of the Provisional Mil Advisory Group has contributed
                                    signficantly to raising the capabilities of the security forces
                                    of the Republic of Korea. This judgment wld seem to be
                                    substantiated by your own recent statement to the effect that
                                    Korean defense forces “are now rapidly approaching the point at
                                    which our security can be assured, provided the Republic of
                                    Korea is not called upon to face attack from foreign

                            </p>
                            <p>It is apparent that all of the Department of the Army obligations can
                                be met by 30 June 1949 if the withdrawal operation from Korea can be
                                downgraded from Secret to Restricted, or lower, to permit the
                                necessary preliminary military actions to begin on 1 May 1949. If
                                desired, the 30 June withdrawal completion date can remain
                                classified Secret until Ambassador Muccio and President Rhee reach
                                an agreement President Rhee’s reluctance to agree to the 30 June
                                date, presumably, is based upon his hope for a promise of more
                                military aid than the conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> 8/2 would provide. Specifically, the Korean desire
                                for additional and larger coast guard vessels (valued at
                                approximately $30,000,000) is understandable, but such vessels
                                definitely are not within the concept of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss> 8/2 and President Rhee’s adamant position should
                                not be allowed to become an obstacle to the execution of the
                                withdrawal as planned.</p>
                            <p>I recommend, therefore, that you concur in the Department of the Army
                                recommendation to downgrade the withdrawal operation (including the
                                necessary preliminary actions and the troop movement to Hawaii) to
                                Unclassified; to keep pertinent sailing dates classified Restricted;
                                and to keep Secret the knowledge that a specific withdrawal
                                completion date has been selected.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Muccio, General Roberts, and Mr. Drumright called at the
                                President’s office by appointment this afternoon. The Prime Minister
                                and the Minister of Defense participated in the discussion at the
                                request of the President.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio said that his purpose in calling was to hand the President
                                a letter pertaining to the future size and disposition of the Korean
                                Military Advisory Group (<gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>). Mr.
                                Muccio then handed the President a signed letter on the subject of
                                even date, a copy of which is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d229fn2"
                                    >See telegram 299, April 28, to Seoul, <ref target="#pg_997">p.

                            </p>
                            <p>President Rhee then read the text of the letter aloud. Upon
                                completion of the reading, Mr. Muccio asked General Roberts to
                                explain what was being done to augment and strengthen <gloss
                                    target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>. General Roberts said that he had
                                been directed to bring the strength of <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss> up to a maximum of five hundred officers and
                                enlisted men. At the present time, he said, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss> has a strength of about 250 officers and enlisted
                                men. He said that as finally constituted, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss> would have a total strength of about 250 officers
                                and an equal number of enlisted men. (At this point, President Rhee
                                summoned his personal secretary, Miss Mary McIntyre, and instructed
                                her to take down an account of the conversation.) General Roberts
                                went on to say that new officers and men for <gloss
                                    target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> are to be selected from the cream
                                of the officers and men now in Korea. If necessary, he said, others
                                would come from Japan. General Roberts said that the great majority
                                of the officers selected would be either in the field grade or
                                captains. Very few lieutenants would be selected for <gloss
                                    target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> duty. Such lieutenants as are
                                selected, he said, will be used as seconds in command. At the
                                present time, screening teams are operating within the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USAFIK1">USAFIK</gloss> organization in order to
                                obtain the best qualified officers and men.</p>
                            <p>General Roberts then asserted that he contemplated assigning from 16
                                to 20 officers to each brigade of the Korean Army. He said that no
                                officers of a grade lower than captain would be assigned down to
                                battalion level. General Roberts went on to say that particular
                                emphasis <pb n="1001" xml:id="pg_1001" facs="0415"/>is being placed
                                on the strengthening of the technical services which he considers to
                                be the weakest segment today of the Korean Army. He said a special
                                effort is being made to recruit the best available officers for
                                quartermaster, ordnance, signal, and engineering services, the
                                objective being to put the Korean Army technical services on the
                                best possible operating basis.</p>
                            <p>General Roberts then said he was recruiting 9 senior officers of the
                                grades of lieutenant colonel or major for duty as police
                                consultants. He said that these consultants would operate under
                                Colonel John Baird, Provost Marshal of <gloss target="#t_USAFIK1"
                                    >USAFIK</gloss>, who will be remaining with <gloss
                                    target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>. He said that one police
                                consultant would be assigned to each of the 9 police districts
                                throughout Korea. General Roberts went on to say that a fair number
                                of officers have been requested for duty with the Korean Coast
                                Guard. He added that their work would aid materially in improving
                                the operations of the Coast Guard.</p>
                            <p>At this point, Mr. Muccio suggested that General Roberts acquaint the
                                President with developments in the ordnance field, etc. General
                                Roberts then said that when Secretary Royall was in Korea in
                                February, the Korean Prime Minister had submitted to him a letter on
                                the subject of armaments, munitions, and the like.<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d229fn3">Not printed.</note> General Roberts added that
                                the matter was being studied and that technicians would be sent to
                                Korea to assist in solving the problem. At this point the President
                                asked whether the technicians-would be included among the 500
                                officers and men assigned to <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>.
                                In response, General Roberts said that they would not be a part of
                                the <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> complement, but would be
                                civilians. At this juncture, Mr. Muccio broke in to state that a
                                committee had been set up to study the problem of ordnance,
                                including such items as requirements, factory sites, personnel, etc.
                                In this connection, President Rhee commented that ordnance plants
                                could not start functioning too soon to suit him.</p>
                            <p>General Roberts then spoke in a general way with regard to the
                                training of the Korean Army. He stated that training of the Army had
                                progressed considerably during the past three months. He said that
                                during the past few months good use had been made of the regimental
                                combat team in the carrying out of demonstrations. All elements of
                                the Korean Army had been privileged to see these <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> demonstrations which ranged through
                                squad, platoon, company, and battalion levels. These demonstrations,
                                General Roberts summed up, had been carried out as far away as Cheju
                                Island and were being concluded on May 5.</p>
                            <p>At this point, President Rhee stated that he wished the assignment of
                                some officers to help in the training of “young people all over the
                                country”. The President went on to say that the Korean authorities
                                    <pb n="1002" xml:id="pg_1002" facs="0416"/>were cleaning’ up
                                Cheju and other places. He then said he feared as soon as this
                                cleaning up operation was completed the guerrillas might spring up
                                again. Unless the people cooperate, the President said, the
                                Government alone cannot stamp out the Communist menace which lies
                                underground. It is therefore necessary that the people themselves
                                play a part in the defense of the nation and their own lives. In
                                this regard, the President went on, the National Association’s whole
                                purpose is to bring about the greatest possible security, peace, and
                                order. The National Association movement, the President said, is a
                                purely nationalistic movement. It is organized everywhere but it
                                must be strengthened. Then there are also the youth groups which
                                have now been united into one group. The youth of Korea must work
                                together. Also there are the women’s organizations, such as in
                                Cheju. The school girls and women must be organized too, the
                                President said. The young people must be counted upon for service in
                                the reserve Army. If all these groups are organized—like the
                                militia—they will become disciplined, and can cooperate with the
                                Army, police, magistrates, etc., and in this way check Communist
                                subversion. The President then said that he talked to these groups
                                when on his trip and had suggested to them that they organize. He
                                had told them that he was trying to obtain experienced Americans to
                                aid them. He then asked how much help Korea could expect in this
                                field from the United States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio replied that with respect to the Army, the reserve Army
                                and the <gloss target="#t_ROTC1">ROTC</gloss> of Korea, United
                                States Army officers could be of assistance. But as far as
                                nonmilitary activities were concerned, Mr. Muccio went on, Mr. John
                                Lasher was being sent to Korea to offer his assistance.<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d229fn4">Mr. Lasher was assigned as an attaché at Seoul,

                                field and would be able, after looking the situation over for a

                                Muccio expressed the view that an organization like the <gloss

                                might be appropriate for Korea at this juncture.</p>
                            <p>The Minister of Defense broke in to inquire what advisers, if any,
                                would be detailed to the Korean Air Force. Mr. Muccio indicated in
                                reply that General Wedemeyer<note n="5" xml:id="d229fn5">Lt. Gen.
                                    Albert C. Wedemeyer, Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and

                                the modern air force is a very complex instrument and offers many
                                complicated problems. Mr. Muccio went on to suggest that in the
                                event of international conflagration<note n="6" xml:id="d229fn6">The

                                    by Mr. Drumright.</note> the U.S. Air Force could be over Korea
                                in a matter of minutes. General Roberts then said that his Table of

                                enlisted men to the Korean Air Force.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Muccio, accompanied by General Roberts and Mr. Drumright, called
                                on President Rhee by appointment today. The President was
                                accompanied by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense.</p>
                            <p>(The conversation largely revolved about the question of the
                                augmentation of the Korean Military Advisory Group and the
                                utilization of American consultants; all this has been reported in a

                            <p>The Korean Minister of Defense, referring to the situation in China,
                                asked whether Mr. Muccio thought relations between Korea and the
                                United States should be reconsidered in the light thereof. Mr.
                                Muccio replied that he deplored the turn of events in China, but he
                                asserted that he felt that the outcome of the struggle in that
                                country would not be clear for some time to come. Mr. Muccio went on
                                to express the view that recent events in China would make no
                                appreciable imprint on the Korean problem in the meantime and in
                                fact might give Korea a breathing space as the Communists—even
                                though successful—will be so preoccupied with getting settled in
                                North China that they won’t have time to think of Korea. He asserted
                                that, a world conflict apart, he did not think there would be an
                                invasion of South Korea from the north. The Minister of Defense said
                                that in her history Korea had twice looked to the United States for
                                guidance and assistance, but that the United States had not
                                responded. He went on to state that although all China appeared to
                                be going Red, all patriotic Koreans would fight the communists.
                                Captain Sihn then inquired what aid could be expected from the
                                United States “when the time comes?”</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio replied that in his view the most urgent need at the
                                moment was to set up a sound, strong and good Government in Korea, a
                                Government that will satisfy the aspirations of the Korean people.
                                    <pb n="1004" xml:id="pg_1004" facs="0418"/>If such a Government
                                is set up, and he expressed belief that it is being set up, little
                                trouble should be anticipated from North Korea. But in the case of a
                                world conflagration, Mr. Muccio said it was beyond his ken and
                                authority to go into that problem. At this juncture, the President
                                stated that when in New York (before 1945) he had received a report
                                through certain channels that some of the Soviet authorities were
                                worrying about the future Korean connection with the United States.
                                These Soviet authorities had instituted inquiries; for example,
                                whether Korea would engage U.S. Military officers. The President
                                said that this information was most interesting, so much so, in
                                fact, that he had sent word of it to the State and War
                                    Departments.<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">See <ref

                                President then added it seemed to him that the main purpose of
                                Communist propaganda was to keep the United States and Korea
                                divided. The President then said he wished to be frank. He went on
                                to say that there was a question in the minds of the Korean people
                                whether the United States can be relied upon. The Korean people
                                never thought, he said, that the United States would drop China. The
                                Korean people really do not know, he explained, what the U.S.
                                Government should do. Here Mr. Muccio interjected that
                                disintegration had been going on in China for several years. The
                                President brought the subject back to Korea, asserting that 50 years
                                ago during the final stages of the corrupt and incompetent Li
                                Dynasty, the Korean people had said, “Never mind.” “Now, they say,
                                let’s all die together,” the President went on to say with great
                                emotion. “We will keep on fighting anyway, no matter what position
                                the United States may take.”</p>
                            <p>The President went on to say that twice in 40 years the United States
                                had abandoned Korea. Theodore Roosevelt had done so the first
                                    time<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">See <ref

                                minds of the Korean people. The Americans liberated Korea, and they
                                give us aid, but if the United States has to be involved in war to
                                save Korea, how much can Korea count on the United States. Then
                                there is the China situation and what can be done about that? Having
                                delivered himself of these statements, the President then said: “We
                                need assurance we will be aided.” Mr. Muccio replied that the United
                                States had been aiding Korea, that it is aiding Korea at the present
                                time, and that it proposes to continue aiding Korea in the future.
                                In a word, he said, it is our definite policy to aid Korea. The
                                economic rehabilitation program we have in effect provides the basis
                                for the economic well-being of the Korean people. The military
                                assistance program now being finalized will make available arms,
                                munitions, and equipment sufficient for assuring internal stability,
                                and also enable South Korea to defend <pb n="1005" xml:id="pg_1005"
                                    facs="0419"/>itself against hostile infiltration and any attack
                                short of an all-out international conflagration. The Prime Minister
                                then injected his usual stand that South Korea should be kept by the
                                United States within its Pacific line of defense as a bridgehead on
                                the continent for the impending war with the U.S.S.R. Mr. Muccio
                                pointed out that the United States was doing everything to avoid
                                war, that the vast majority of the people of the United States were
                                still of the opinion that world war was not inevitable, and that we
                                were straining every resource to avert war, that we were all doing
                                our very best to win the cold war and that it was not up to us here
                                to prepare for a hot war. Should that unfortunately come about, the
                                military would have to step in and take over direction.</p>
                            <p>The President then asserted it had been suggested the United States
                                has decided it is not worth while to try to defend Korea. Hence the
                                proposals made working for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. In this
                                connection, the President cited the Royall statement on Japan<note
                                    n="6" xml:id="d230fn6">See airgram 35 from Tokyo, February 12,
                                        <ref target="#pg_648">p. 648</ref>.</note> as indicative of
                                the American position in this respect. If Japan was outside the
                                United States defense line, the President suggested, then Korea must
                                be well outside that line. The President then asserted that the
                                story of the contraction of the U.S. defense line in the Pacific had
                                been spread all over Korea. Its spread had created great unrest and
                                had furnished much grist to the Communist propaganda mill. Only the
                                other day, the President went on, Kim Koo<note n="7"

                                Kunsan that the United States was dropping Korea, and so on. The
                                President added that most Koreans were determined to fight to the
                                last man, come what may, but a few people were not that way; some
                                were defeatist. All this, he continued, has a tremendous influence
                                under the surface. The President then said he would be grateful if
                                President Truman and the State Department could help him clarify
                                this situation. “We have certain assurances,” the President said,
                                “but it remains a difficult and critical situation.”</p>

                            <p>2. After consultation with General Roberts, military attaché, and

                                L–5’s now operational. These craft found highly valuable for
                                observation purposes in Cheju and Chiri Mts. Operations against
                                Commie guerrillas would also be helpful in spotting smuggling and
                                hostile infiltration activities.</p>
                            <p>4. Trainers requested would be utilized to train <gloss

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: On 29 April the Acting
                                Secretary of the Army requested your concurrence in a plan to
                                downgrade the security classification of the military withdrawal
                                from Korea in order that necessary preliminary actions might begin
                                on 1 May to insure the completion of the withdrawal by 30 June. The
                                Department of State did not concur in the proposed Army action and
                                implied that concurrence in the final withdrawal of our troops might
                                be contingent upon the provision of certain additional vessels and
                                equipment requested by Ambassador Muccio for the Korean Coast Guard.
                                This additional requirement, which is not within the scope of the
                                conclusions of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 8/2 “Position of
                                the U.S. with Respect to Korea”,<note n="1" xml:id="d233fn1">Dated
                                    March 22, <ref target="#pg_969">p. 969</ref>.</note> is a change
                                from the position heretofore adopted by the Department of State in
                                support of the Department of the Army plan for the withdrawal. The
                                postponements by the Department of State in the past, of dates
                                previously agreed to for the withdrawal, have already created
                                serious logistical and budgetary problems. I am sure you share my
                                concern over the unwarranted expense which will result from further
                                delay and indecision in this matter.</p>
                            <p>In order that the Department of the Army can meet the 30 June 1949
                                withdrawal date prescribed in the conclusions of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 8/2, “Position of the U.S. with
                                Respect to Korea”, it is Requested that you agree to the immediate
                                downgrading of the withdrawal operation. Otherwise a subsequent
                                downgrading date should be set with resultant withdrawal completion
                                date being delayed beyond 30 June. In the latter event, it will be
                                necessary for your Department to support such supplemental
                                appropriations as may be necessary.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>I have not been able to pursue seeking Rhee concurrence in early
                                withdrawal date and matter becoming more complex daily in view
                                following:</p>
                            <p>First, I am still awaiting directions regarding Coast Guard and Air
                                support which would greatly help in bringing Rhee around. I consider
                                items for Coast Guard requested mytel 447, April 26 of prime
                                importance. I have repeatedly pointed this up since my first
                                telegram 69 of January 27. My conviction that Coast Guard must be
                                strengthened does not stem therefore from recent developments in
                                China.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, local press unquestionably inspired by governmental circles
                                has given prominence to up play-back of Rhee’s interview requesting
                                “a mutual defense agreement”. The <hi rend="italic">Ryun Hab
                                    Shinmun</hi>, considered close to presidential family, on May 4
                                even went so far as to state that “according to a certain
                                    source…<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">Omission indicated in the

                                rapidly and signing expected in Washington middle of this

                            <p>Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer showed me a copy of a cable he had just
                                received from Lake Success which presented the views of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">UN Secretariat</hi> on the subject of UN military
                                observers being stationed in Korea.</p>
                            <p>The cable stated in substance the Secretariat’s lack of enthusiasm
                                for the project, pointing out that all previous UN observer teams
                                had been sent to the field by resolution of the Security Council or
                                the General Assembly, and that the General Assembly Resolution of
                                December 12, 1948 made no direct reference to the problem of
                                military observers other than those which the Commission might
                                require to implement paragraph 4 (d) of the Resolution. The cable
                                went on to say that military observers were hardly capable of
                                evaluating internal civil disturbances. (I gather that in his letter
                                to the UN (see memorandom of conversation No. 35 dated May 2,
                                despatch No. 243 dated May 4, 1949)),<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2"
                                    >Neither is printed.</note> Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer had
                                suggested that observers be stationed at the tension points within
                                the Republic of Korea, in addition to being located along the 38th
                                parallel.) The telegram went on to say that if the U.S. withdrew its
                                armed forces from Korea, it could be presumed that America was at
                                least satisfied that there was no longer a threat to international
                                peace existing in this area. The cable said further that it hoped
                                that the Commission would study this matter very carefully, but at
                                first glance there appeared to be little justification for UN
                                military observers being stationed anywhere in Korea other than for
                                the purpose indicated in paragraph 4(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) of
                                the General Assembly Resolution of December 12, 1948. The stationing
                                of UN observers would be an expensive proposition, and <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> had no funds for such
                                    purpose.<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">
                                    <p>On May 11, Mr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer met with Ambassador
                                        Muccio and Mr. Gardiner to discuss again the question of
                                        military observer teams. In a memorandum of conversation
                                        (not printed), May 12, transmitted to the Department as
                                        enclosure No. 2 to despatch 250, Mr. Gardiner quoted a
                                        portion of a telegram handed to Ambassador Muccio by Mr.
                                        Ranshofen-Wertheimer, which the latter said he had recently
                                        received from U.N. Headquarters. The excerpt from the U.N.
                                        telegram read as follows:</p>
                                    <p>“Military observation is expensive undertaking. Commission
                                        budget is limited; therefore, Secretary General could not
                                        finance it except as emergency threatening maintenance
                                        international peace. Withdrawal U.S. troops weakens this
                                        justification. Sending material on organizational problems
                                        but these should not worry Commission this stage. Important
                                        thing is to find adequate basis for presence military
                                        observers. Urge upon them (Commission) importance most
                                        careful study.”</p>

                            <p>Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer went on to say that if it could be proved
                                there was a threat to international peace in this area, that
                                something might be done about setting up the observer teams. I said
                                that in other words if, for example, <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss> had evidence that the South Korean military were
                                probing across the 38th parallel in a series of damaging raids, that
                                that information might serve as a basis on which <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> might adopt a resolution
                                calling for UN military observer teams. Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer
                                said that such information in the hands of the Commission might be
                                useful for his proposal.</p>
                            <p>I asked Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer if he would care to make a copy of
                                the cable he showed me, but he felt he could not do so. I said that
                                that was alright as in any event I could remember the main details
                                of the cable. These are presented herewith.<note n="4"

                                        that there appeared to be little enthusiasm among the

                            <p>506. The following press release No. 2A 1949 has just been delivered
                                to foreign correspondents in Seoul:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“President Syngman Rhee has asked the Office of Public
                                    Information to release the following statement:</p>
                                <pb n="1012" xml:id="pg_1012" facs="0426"/>
                                <p>“What we are trying to find out, states President Rhee, is
                                    whether or not the United States considers that Southern Korea
                                    falls within its own first line of defense. Would an attack upon
                                    Southern Korea be interpreted in the United States as tantamount
                                    to an attack upon the American people themselves? In the case of
                                    an attack by an outside power, would the Republic of Korea be
                                    able to count upon all-out American military aid? This question
                                    is of far greater importance than the mere question of whether
                                    or not the remaining American troops are to stay in Korea. The
                                    Republic of Korea is struggling for its life against a Communist
                                    menace that is not of its own making. When Japan was defeated,
                                    there were no Communists in Korea. They were invited in by the
                                    division of our country across the middle by Russian-American
                                    agreement. The Communists were greatly encouraged and
                                    strengthened in South Korea by efforts to deal with them on a
                                    basis of compromise. Compromise with aggressors means ultimate
                                    surrender without a chance to resist, which we cannot and will
                                    not do.</p>
                                <p>“We do not propose to fight the North Korean Communists or their
                                    foreign overlords. We will continue our efforts to unify the
                                    North and South by peaceful means. At the same time, we are
                                    responsible for the protection of the lives and property of our
                                    people; and when the Korean Communists come over the 38th
                                    parallel and destroy us, we cannot sit still and allow them to
                                    harm us without resistance; we must make their invasion of the
                                    South costly to them. For this purpose we need a sufficient
                                    supply of adequate weapons for our defense”.</p>

                            <p>In releasing the President’s statement, Mr. Kim Dong Sung, Director
                                of the Office of Public Information, said:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“During all the 3 years of American Military Government in South
                                    Korea, the Nationalist Korean leaders were forbidden to denounce
                                    Communism. Dozens of radio addresses by Dr. Rhee and other
                                    leaders were strictly censored to remove all criticisms of
                                    Communism. South Korea was forbidden the right to build up an
                                    army for its own defense. All attempts to prevent Communist
                                    organization and propaganda were forbidden. We were asked to
                                    trust the United States to solve our problems, and to wait
                                    patiently until a Russian-American agreement should somehow be
                                    reached. Now the United States asks if we are ready and willing
                                    for all remaining American troops to be withdrawn. What we want
                                    to know is what will be done to protect us from the Communist
                                    menace that keeps our country divided into two halves, and that
                                    has even introduced Communism into our own communities in the
                                    south? The United States has left us with a problem too great to
                                    be solved by ourselves alone, especially with half our strength
                                    shorn away. We do not believe that the United States can or will
                                    withdraw its remaining troops until it has answered our question
                                    as to what will be done to aid us in case of a Communist attack
                                    from across the 38th parallel line.”</p>

                            <p>515. 1. Accompanied by General Roberts and Drumright, I called on
                                President Rhee afternoon 7th, invited his attention to press
                                statements set forth mytels 505<note n="1" xml:id="d238fn1">Not
                                    printed; it reported President Rhee’s responses to questions on
                                    matters other than U.S. troop withdrawal, which was covered in
                                    telegram 506 (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>). Among other things,
                                    President Rhee complained about lack of U.S. assistance to South
                                    Korea in the form of military equipment and weapons
                                    (805.00/5–749).</note> and 506, May 7, and told him I was
                                disturbed and even shocked by their tone and content. I said I
                                regarded their release as unfortunate and likely to contribute to
                                Korean-American misunderstanding rather than to mutual confidence
                                and good-will. I pointed out that a whipped-up press campaign
                                directed to US people was particularly harmful at this juncture when
                                US Government is considering question further economic and military
                                aid Korea. I also took occasion state US had never entered into
                                mutual defense pact with any single nation, adding constant public
                                reference here was embarrassing and would be productive of no
                                favorable result.<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">President Rhee had
                                    indicated displeasure with the lack of progress toward

                                    States and the Republic of Korea (895.00/5–749).</note>

                            <p>2. Rhee responded statement set forth mytel 506 had been released
                                without his express authorization. He went on, however, to defend in
                                general way position adopted in statement, saying he in difficult
                                position vis-à-vis Korean people and in need some definite
                                understanding with US in defense Korea following US troop
                                withdrawal. While conversation on this subject terminated
                                inconclusively, I have hopes Rhee will be more careful re future
                                releases.</p>
                            <p>3. Later when discussion turned to recent 38th parallel incidents I
                                took occasion urge Rhee to restrain <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> (Republic of Korea) forces from taking any
                                aggressive action, pointing out such action would jeopardize

                                bloc. Rhee replied <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> harbors no
                                aggressive aims, had not taken initiative at Kaesong, but would

                                letter of May 4, I am enclosing a copy of an urgent telegram which
                                the State Department transmitted to Ambassador Muccio at Seoul on

                            <p>While this Department shares your concern over the added expense that
                                would be occasioned in case a delay in the implementation of
                                withdrawal plans becomes necessary at this time, I am certain that
                                you appreciate the necessity of so proceeding in this step as to
                                minimize to the greatest practicable extent the risk that withdrawal
                                might work to our disadvantage in terms of the other objectives we
                                seek to accomplish in Korea, as set forth in the conclusions of

                            <p>In the course of a call on President Rhee the afternoon of May 7,
                                1949, the President made reference to the recent military clash at
                                    Kaesong,<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">See telegram 498, May 6,
                                    from Seoul, <ref target="#pg_1008">p. 1008</ref>.</note> saying
                                that this incident had put him in a very difficult position. He said
                                that although the situation at Kaesong was now fortunately quiet, a
                                good many people had been importuning him to take strong action
                                against the northern invaders.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio stated that the incident at Kaesong was a most serious
                                one, adding that General Roberts was setting up a board to
                                investigate the causes therefor and the facts. At this point,
                                President Rhee inquired whether there was any discrepancy in the
                                statements issued by the Korean authorities with regard to the
                                Kaesong incident. In response to this question, General Roberts
                                asserted that on May 6th a unit of the Korean army had penetrated
                                north across the parallel to a depth of four kilometers and had shot
                                up several settlements. General Roberts went on to say that perhaps
                                the reports he was receiving were inaccurate. In view of this
                                possibility, he was therefore setting up an investigation board to
                                ascertain the facts.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Muccio pointed out that there is a United Nations Commission in
                                Korea. Mr. Muccio went on to say it would be most unfortunate if the
                                United Nations Commission got the impression that the Korean
                                military forces were embarking on an aggressive policy. If such a
                                report got back to Lake Success, Mr. Muccio continued, it would
                                create a bad impression on the forty-eight nations which have been
                                supporting the Republic of Korea.</p>
                            <p>The President stressed the strategic importance of Kaesong. He said
                                that the Korean Government could not yield inch by inch at Kaesong
                                or elsewhere. “We will not move away from Kaesong. We will not yield
                                inch by inch. If we retreat we might as well quit now”, the
                                President asserted in a very firm and categorical manner. The
                                President went on to say that he did not believe that his boys had
                                gone across the 38th parallel. They had merely defended themselves
                                against attack from the north. After some further brief discussion
                                of the Chunchon incident, which involved the defection of
                                approximately three hundred Korean soldiers to the north,<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d242fn3">See footnote 5, <ref target="#pg_1009">p.
                                        1009</ref>.</note> the President again stressed the fact
                                that the Korean Government must stand firm against Communist
                                aggression. In response to these repeated statements Mr. Muccio
                                stated that the United States supported the Korean Government firmly
                                on its defensive measures. But should the Korean Government resort
                                to aggressive measures, Mr. Muccio said he wished to point out that
                                the U.S. could not be of any assistance in this regard. At this
                                point the President reiterated his belief that his soldiers had not
                                crossed the parallel or committed any act of aggression. The
                                President <pb n="1018" xml:id="pg_1018" facs="0432"/>defended the
                                reports submitted by the Korean army on the Kaesong incident and
                                expressed confidence that they were accurate. Before closing the
                                conversation President Rhee reiterated again and again the statement
                                that his army would not resort to aggressive measures, would not
                                cross the 38th parallel, would not provoke clashes with the North
                                Korean forces, but would defend itself against all attacks.</p>

                                    <p>Korean Special Representative John M. Chang had forwarded to
                                        the Department under cover of an undated letter, probably
                                        transmitted on March 24, a lengthy memorandum from Chough
                                        Pyung Ok dated March 23 containing specific requests for
                                        military aid. On April 20, Mr. Butterworth acknowledged
                                        receipt of Dr. Chang’s letter and promised that Dr. Chough’s

                            <p>I raised at once the matter of the press release issued by the Korean
                                Government on May 7 in the name of President Rhee (Seoul’s telegram
                                No. 506, May 7) and said that, as the Ambassador presumably was
                                aware, the reaction to that statement in U.S. Government circles in
                                Washington had been very unfavorable indeed. I reminded the <pb

                                that I had made it a point to counsel them against this very thing
                                during the course of our last conversation,<note n="2"

                                unfortunate effects which such utterances were bound to have. I
                                pointed out that the reflection on U.S. intentions with respect to
                                Korea implicit in that statement, coming as it did at a time when
                                the Congress was about to consider the question of aid to Korea,
                                could only complicate the task of those of us who were endeavoring
                                to obtain sympathetic consideration of the needs of the Korean
                                Government in the fields of economic, military, and other
                                assistance.</p>
                            <p>I went on to say that we took particular exception to President
                                Rhee’s statement that we had “invited” the Russians into Korea.
                                U.S.–Soviet agreement on the 38 degree parallel line had not, I
                                pointed out, served to let the Soviets into north Korea, but had had
                                the effect rather of preventing them from occupying south Korea as
                                well. I reminded the Ambassador that Russian troops had occupied
                                Korea north of the 38 degree parallel as much as three weeks before
                                we had entered south Korea, and that but for that line they could
                                easily have occupied the entire peninsula by the time the first
                                American troops set foot on Korean soil. The Ambassador replied that
                                rightly or wrongly most Koreans, including himself, have long been
                                under the impression that the division of Korea between the U.S. and
                                the USSR was agreed upon at Yalta, and that it was this impression
                                which doubtless lay behind President Rhee’s statement. I pointed out
                                that it was a responsibility of the Korean Government to attempt to
                                disabuse the Korean people of misconceptions, not to foster
                                them.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Chough then stated that, while he knew nothing about the
                                statement beyond what he had read in the newspapers, he was certain
                                that President Rhee intended no criticism of the U.S., an
                                interpretation which I stated that I accepted. Dr. Chough went on to
                                point out, however, that the prospect of the pending withdrawal of
                                U.S. occupation forces from Korea, considered in conjunction with
                                recent Communist successes in China and aggravated by the unceasing
                                barrage of Communist propaganda from Radio Pyongyang, was having a
                                deleterious effect on the morale of the people of south Korea, who
                                were becoming increasingly restive and uneasy about the future. He
                                went on to say that this had in turn had a disturbing effect on
                                President Rhee who felt that, as a counter-measure, some public
                                assurance should be forthcoming from the U.S. to the effect that it
                                would not abandon Korea—perhaps a reaffirmation of U.S. adherence to
                                the Treaty of 1882.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">See footnote 1 to

                                Treaty of 1882, it certainly was not our <pb n="1021"
                                    xml:id="pg_1021" facs="0435"/>intention to abandon Korea and
                                there should be no objection to our saying as much at an appropriate
                                time. The Ambassador urged that we give serious consideration to the
                                early issuance of such a statement.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Chang then added that one of the favorite themes of the
                                Communist radio was that the U.S., having “washed its hands” of
                                China, was now preparing to do the same thing in Korea. In response
                                to this remark I hastened to make it clear to the Ambassador that
                                the U.S. had in no sense “washed its hands” of China, but that on
                                the contrary it was the Chinese Nationalists who had “put their
                                hands in their pockets” by failing to put up any effective
                                resistance to the Communists, thus rendering further U.S. aid
                                unavailing. I then reminded the Ambassador in passing of the lessons
                                which his Government should learn from the China situation.</p>
                            <p>Reverting to President Rhee’s statement concerning a defense pact
                                with the U.S.,<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">See footnote 2, <ref
                                        target="#pg_1013">p. 1013</ref>.</note> I said that it
                                seemed to me that it was inadvisable on his part to hold out to his
                                people the implied promise of obtaining such a pact when in fact he
                                must know that a commitment of this sort was out of the question for
                                the U.S.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion Ambassador Chang expressed his grave concern over the
                                activities of a group of Korean “Communists” on the west coast of
                                the U.S., a problem which I suggested he discuss with Mr. Bond.</p>

                            <p>529. I called on President Rhee afternoon 11th and, after handing him
                                    letter<note n="1" xml:id="d245fn1">Not printed.</note> with list

                                    >ROK</gloss> on April 30, conveyed to him orally substance first
                                substantive paragraph <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 328,
                                May 9. I also referred in general way to worldwide demand for US
                                military aid, pointing out Korean requests in this respect would
                                have to be considered in light that factor.</p>
                            <p>2. On whole Rhee received my representations with good grace. Briefly
                                his comment was to following effect: At present time he confronted
                                with trying situation. Apparently referring his statement on US
                                troop withdrawal, he said he had not realized how concerned public
                                reaction would be, how apprehensive Korean people were. He then
                                referred to Communist infiltration activities and went on to say it
                                his impression US policy one of peace and not firmly consistent in
                                all parts world. All these factors, he said, made it difficult for
                                him to implant feeling of peace and security in Korean people. He
                                then said <pb n="1022" xml:id="pg_1022" facs="0436"/>it perhaps
                                mistake try force hand US Government adding, however, he did not
                                think it wrong make Korean position clear to American people. That,
                                he said, was all he had in mind in issuing his statement. He then
                                said US had given various assurances of aid to <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, but he had hoped some further
                                public assurance of aid could come from Washington. He repeated over
                                and over his problem how keep Korean people assured. In summing up
                                he requested US Government “be liberal” to <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>3. I reviewed aid already extended <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss>, pointed out military and economic aid continuing
                                at this time and invited his attention fact question further aid now
                                before Executive and Legislative branches US Government. I stressed
                                fact departure US combat team indicated no withdrawal US aid and no

                                the Secretary of State’s letter of May 10 in acknowledgement

                                16th:</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Yesterday news clippings from the United States were brought to
                                    President Rhee’s attention relating to a statement issued by him
                                    on May 7. Actually, through an unfortunate oversight, what was
                                    released on that date was a rough outline of what the President
                                    was preparing to say.</p>
                                <p>“The offices of the President’s Secretariat and Public
                                    Information join in expressing regret over the carelessness in
                                    releasing the unfinished copy as the President’s formal
                                    statement, and hereby earnestly request all press correspondents
                                    to help make clear the following points as the correct view of
                                    the President:</p>
                                <p>“The President’s statement: All of my friends who know what I
                                    stand for will, I hope, understand my position in spite of any
                                    misstatements that may occur. I did not, of course, say that the
                                    Communist menace was made in Washington as well as Moscow.
                                    Rather, I meant to make clear what I have said more than once in
                                    the past: that the division of Korea between the United States
                                    in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea was made
                                    between these two powers without our knowledge. The
                                    responsibility for this division will not, I am certain, be
                                    disavowed by the powers who made it, and we naturally expect the
                                    United States to stand by and help us solve this problem. We say
                                    this in no spirit of criticism, but rather to help insure a
                                    correct mutual understanding of the situation by the Korean and

                                <p>“As I have said before and I repeat: We are ready to maintain
                                    internal peace and order without foreign aid. So far as our
                                    internal order is concerned, we would be safe even if the United
                                    States token security force were withdrawn today. I must again
                                    repeat, however, that if we should be attacked by a major
                                    foreign power we would need more than mere moral help from those
                                    nations friendly to us.</p>
                                <p>“Ambassador Muccio was right when he said I have never asked him
                                    for a mutual defense pact between the Governments of the United
                                    States and Korea. There has been talk about such a pact, and it
                                    has been proposed by our representative to the United Nations in
                                    New York, Ambassador Chough Pyung Ok, and we do hope some such
                                    arrangement can be arrived at. But it is quite correct that I
                                    have not made any such request of him. What I am advocating as a
                                    solution to the grave threat against Korea and all Asia by the
                                    aggressive forces of Communism is adoption of one of the
                                    following three things: (1) the formation of a Pacific Pact
                                    similar to the Atlantic Pact; or (2) an agreement between the
                                    United States and Korea alone, or with some other nations, for
                                    mutual defense against any aggressor nations; or (3) <pb

                                    by the United States of a pledge to defend a reunited,
                                    democratic, independent Korea, in accordance with the policy of
                                    President Truman respecting Communist aggression.</p>
                                <p>“It must be made clear that in asking the United States to aid us
                                    in preserving our freedom we are not asking that US troops be
                                    made to fight our battles. It is an outright assurance of
                                    material as well as moral aid from the United States that is
                                    most needed. Korea stands willing to fight any nation or nations
                                    that should attack and attempt to destroy us. Whatever happens,
                                    we will fight to defend ourselves until we have exhausted every
                                    means at our command, whether or not we have outside aid. So
                                    long as we continue our struggle to maintain a peaceful
                                    independent existence as a free and democratic nation, we can
                                    only trust that we may receive the same moral and material aid
                                    given so freely by the United States to all the powers allied to
                                    it during the past two world wars. We believe that in fighting
                                    for ourselves we are fighting for all other democracies. I
                                    cannot see why the democracies should not stand together for
                                    mutual defense while the Communists gang up together for the
                                    destruction of all democratic governments and the conquest of
                                    all free peoples.”</p>

                                            the good offices of the UN. The U.S. placed the question
                                            of Korean independence before the General Assembly of
                                            the UN and played a leading part in the adoption of the
                                            course of action which it took to establish a free
                                            government in Korea. Failure of that government to
                                            survive will not only directly affect U.S. interests in
                                            the Far East, but will indirectly affect the interest of
                                            the U.S. through damaging the prestige and influence of
                                            the UN, the support of which is a primary principle of

                                Mr. Hoffman said that <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> acceptance
                                of responsibility was premised on the assumption that the economic
                                assistance to be given would be an <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> type program and of several years’ duration.
                                Immediately after this meeting Mr. Hoffman requested the Department
                                of State to give his agency policy guidance as to the future program
                                of economic assistance for which it should plan. Following his
                                request Secretary Marshall sent Mr. Hoffman the letter dated
                                September 17, 1948 (Tab B).</p>
                            <p>Secretary Marshall’s letter stated that the Department of State felt
                                it should be the policy of the United States to provide Korea with
                                the aid which in the long run will be most effective for the
                                fulfillment of U.S. objectives regarding Korea and which will entail
                                the least drain on the economy of the United States. The letter
                                enclosed a study made in the Department of several alternative
                                courses of action to accomplish U.S. policy objectives with respect
                                to Korea. The letter stated that after careful consideration of the
                                advantages and disadvantages of these alternative courses it was the

                                long run be best served by planning for a program of relief and

                                expenditures for the most essential capital equipment calculated to
                                place the Republic of Korea as rapidly and as nearly as possible on
                                a self-supporting basis. The letter added that in order to reduce
                                the cost to the United States to the minimum this program should be
                                planned to commence with the second half of fiscal year 1949 (later

                            <p>It was the view of the Department that the capital development
                                program proposed would be the most effective for the fulfillment of
                                U.S. objectives and would entail the least drain on the economy of
                                the United States for the following reasons:</p>

                                <item>The only real hope for establishing a united Korea which will
                                    be independent—rather than under Soviet control—will be for the
                                    Republic to demonstrate its ability to survive and for its
                                    people to become substantially self-supporting at a reasonable
                                    standard of living. In order to become substantially
                                    self-supporting Korea must have capital equipment in the fields
                                    of coal, electric power, and commercial fertilizer production
                                    and of transportation. This can of course be provided only
                                    through a capital assistance program. Without it, no matter how
                                    long relief is continued, it will be known to the people of both
                                    South and North Korea that the economy of South Korea is not
                                    becoming self-supporting and must depend upon outside assistance
                                    for its survival. Since there is no reasonable hope for a large
                                    income for South Korea from exports, the withdrawal of
                                    assistance at any time before South Korea has become able to
                                    meet its requirements for coal, power and fertilizer from
                                    internal sources would result in an increasing deficit or
                                    progressive lowering of the standard of living. Under such
                                    circumstances there would appear to be no prospect that the
                                    regime and people in North Korea will be persuaded of the future
                                    stability of the Republic and thus be induced to join with
                                    it.</item>

                                <item>Assuming the United States will not abandon the Republic
                                    before it is substantially able to support itself, a capital
                                    equipment program will in the short run be the most economical
                                    form of assistance. Taken over a three year period, I understand
                                    that recent <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> estimates place
                                    the total cost of a capital assistance program at $415,000,000,
                                    and that thereafter the annual deficit would be approximately
                                    $40,000,000 at the same standard of living. Under such
                                    circumstances the Koreans would be able to supply most of their
                                    basic needs for coal, electric power and fertilizer production
                                    and, with the possibility of some small private investment, the
                                    United States could either end its assistance entirely or reduce
                                    it very considerably.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>As a second alternative, <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                                estimates that a relief program, with some raw materials and spare
                                parts, would come to approximately $332,000,000 for a three year
                                period, but would leave a deficit in the fourth year of about
                                $94,000,000. Such a program would not provide for increases in
                                fertilizer plant capacity necessary to produce the <pb n="1028"
                                    xml:id="pg_1028" facs="0442"/>fertilizer required to preserve
                                productivity of the soil, or for the coal and electric power
                                production capacity necessary to run such fertilizer plants if they
                                existed. Nor would this program enable the production of sufficient
                                commodities for export to make it possible for Korea to buy even its
                                minimum fertilizer requirements, much less its total import needs.
                                Under the circumstances, with the ending of U.S. aid, South Korea
                                would rapidly become unable even to feed itself.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> estimates that a third
                                alternative, a program of pure relief, would cost some $310,000,000
                                over the planning period and would leave a deficit of some
                                $109,000,000 in the fourth year. Without continuing assistance, the
                                situation of South Korea would not only be as bad as under the
                                second alternative, but would be worsened by the fact that the
                                entire industrial plant, being without repair parts, would have
                                already suffered continuing deterioration.</p>
                            <p>It is appreciated that the capital development program proposed would
                                cost some $50,000,000 to $70,000,000 more in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                    >FY</gloss> 1950 than the second and third alternatives
                                mentioned above and $20,000,000 to $35,000,000 more in 1951, if
                                continued. However, it would cost less than the second and no more
                                than the third if continued in 1952. In succeeding years, as
                                indicated above, it would enable the Koreans at least to meet their
                                minimum domestic food requirements.</p>
                            <p>The object of any defensible program for Korea should be to solve the
                                balance of payment problems. It therefore seems imperative that the
                                program chosen be one which by dealing directly with fundamental
                                deficiencies in the Korean economy can come reasonably close to
                                meeting this objective—as a relief or relief and rehabilitation
                                program could not.</p>
                            <p>A part of the capital equipment which would be made available to
                                Korea under this program might be done without should unity of the
                                country occur. However, it does not seem wise to act on the
                                assumption that unification may occur in the next two or three
                                years. Unification on a democratic basis does not now seem assured
                                tinder any circumstances. It can hardly be hoped for at all unless
                                the Republic gives convincing evidence of its firm and lasting

                            <p>For the reasons outlined above, I believe that the character of
                                program now before you is, of the several alternatives, the one best
                                calculated to make effective the conclusions of the National
                                Security Council reached in March with the President’s approval and
                                that legislative authorization should therefore be sought for the
                                program.</p>
                            <p>The points I have outlined above of course relate only to the
                                interests of the United States in supplying assistance to Korea and
                                to the preferability of the particular character of assistance
                                proposed. They are not intended to refer to the actual projects
                                embraced by the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> request. By
                                agreement between <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> and the

                                preparation of the program itself. The program as proposed is
                                considered to be in accord with the policy established by the

                                its estimate to the Bureau and made an oral defense at a hearing
                                before a panel. I am sure if you have further questions on this
                                aspect of the problem Mr. Hoffman will be glad to answer them.</p>

                            <p>554. Accompanied by General Roberts and Drumright, I called on
                                President Rhee this morning. At my suggestion, he had with him Prime
                                Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister.</p>
                            <p>In course of ensuing 2-hour conversation, I indicated withdrawal US
                                troops, initiated latter part 1948, would be completed by departure
                                    <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> during “next few weeks.” I
                                avoided telling Rhee we expected complete evacuation <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> by June 30.</p>
                            <p>Before conveying foregoing information to Rhee, General Roberts and I
                                transferred Korean security forces [apparent omission] and stated
                                certain further military equipment and supplies now on hand with
                                    <gloss target="#t_USAFIK1">USAFIK</gloss> or in transit would be
                                transferred Korean forces subsequently. I pointed out equipping

                                    >DA</gloss> and it conviction our military experts Korean Army
                                adequately equipped meet current requirements. I also stressed
                                completion withdrawal US forces excepting <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss> meant no lessening US aid and support Korean
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Rhee and his cabinet colleagues accepted my remarks re withdrawal
                                with some reluctance. However, it was apparent they were resigned to
                                fact of early withdrawal. Rhee suggested, as he has on several
                                recent occasions, issuance of public statement in Washington of
                                continuing US aid and support would be extremely helpful to him
                                convincing Korean people withdrawal US troops not catastrophe to
                                Korea. Rhee also mentioned desirability of conclusion of Pacific
                                Pact similar Atlantic Pact, or conclusion agreement between US and
                                Korea alone or with other nations for mutual defense against any
                                aggressor nations, or reaffirmation by US of amity clause US-Korean
                                treaty 1882. I gave Rhee no encouragement re these desiderata except
                                to say US would be willing consider negotiation modern treaty of
                                friendship and commerce. In this connection, Rhee stated friendship
                                treaty would be helpful but not particularly responsive Korea
                                current needs unless treaty included military aid provisions.</p>
                            <pb n="1030" xml:id="pg_1030" facs="0444"/>
                            <p>On basis our conversation today, I consider Rhee reconciled to
                                completion US troop withdrawal and feel he will make no strong
                                effort impede such withdrawal. While Rhee obviously would like
                                categorical declaration all-out US support his government in event
                                third power aggression, I believe he and Korean people will be
                                satisfied in end by issuance of general statement pointing out
                                completion US troops withdrawal means no lessening of US aid and
                                support which continuing and which expected continue in future. See

                            <p>567. Following is text joint statement by Minister Foreign Affairs
                                and Minister Defense issued here this afternoon.</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is reported that the United States forces in Korea are
                                    withdrawing because the President of Korea has agreed to the
                                    withdrawal of US forces. At this time it should be made clear
                                    what the President of this government meant when he agreed with
                                    the idea of the withdrawal of troops from Korea by the United
                                    States. What the President meant was this: The United States
                                    created the 38th parallel jointly with USSR—The United States
                                    will feel the responsibility both from moral and political
                                    standpoints. With regard to the situations in the Far East it is
                                    understood that the United States should be assured of the
                                    adequate defense of the Republic of Korea before they withdraw
                                    their forces from Korea. They should not consider withdrawing
                                    the American forces until this obligation has been fulfilled.
                                    The President did not mean that they should withdraw until this
                                    has been fulfilled. Democracy is based on the moral
                                    sensibilities of the peoples while they deal with each other.
                                    Korea sincerely expects a great democratic nation such as the
                                    United States will not hesitate to fulfill its moral
                                    obligations.</p>
                                <p>“The government of the Republic of Korea has submitted to the

                                    Far East. According to dependable information USSR has made
                                    agreement with the puppet government in North Korea to
                                    completely arm 6 divisions of infantry and 3 divisions of

                                    turn had provoked some concern in the minds of members of the

                                requesting that government to lend its good offices for establishing
                                contact between the Commission and North Korean personalities.<note

                                    is printed in U.N. document A/936, p. 8.</note> No answer was
                                received to that request. On that occasion it was stated that this
                                attempt was only one of the endeavors made by the Commission to
                                establish contact with the north. It was understood that the
                                Commission would continue its efforts in this connection. Inquiries
                                were made as to various possible channels of communication with the
                                north. At the 10th, 12th, 14th meetings of subcommittee I, the
                                Secretariat of the Commission presented a report upon its technical
                                inquiries at various places concerning possible links with North
                                Korea. The only practical method of communication was reported to be
                                via ship from Hong Kong to a North Korean port in the light of these
                                considerations and upon recommendation of subcommittee I the
                                Commission decided at its 21st meeting on 18 March 1949 to instruct
                                the principal Secretary to despatch a letter over his signature to
                                General Kim Il Sung for purpose of effecting technical arrangements
                                for the Commission or members of the Commission to visit North
                                Korea. A member of the Secretariat left for Hong Kong the same day
                                to carry the letter. The text of the letter sent to General Kim Il
                                Sung is reproduced hereunder.</p>

                                    it could not implement these instructions without being in a
                                    position to inform itself of the situation north of the 38th
                                    parallel. As a first step in the implementation of the
                                    instructions received from the General Assembly the Commission
                                    on 18 February 1949 through the Secretary General of the United
                                    Nations requested the Government of the USSR to lend its good
                                    offices for the establishment of the desired contact. In view of
                                    the lack of normal communications including the impossibility of
                                    getting in touch with you directly by mail or cable I am
                                    choosing rather reluctantly this way of approaching you with the
                                    request to facilitate such a visit. This visit should take place
                                    at the earliest possible date. The Commission is informed that
                                    there are practical means of travel to North Korea via ship from
                                    Hong Kong without delay. However it feels that you might suggest
                                    a more direct means of access. For your information I am
                                    attaching a list of the Commission with indications of the
                                    membership of subcommittee I and II as well as a list of names
                                    of the members of the Secretariat who might accompany them. The
                                    latter are international officials who have sworn their
                                    allegiance exclusively to the United Nations and who are not
                                    allowed to accept any instructions from their own or from any
                                    other government. In view of the absence of normal means of
                                    communication your reply may be sent through the same channels
                                    as this letter is forwarded in its original. The necessary
                                    arrangements have been made in Hong Kong for any message from
                                    you to be transmitted to me without delay. I shall however be
                                    glad to receive any authentic reply from you in any other manner

                            <p>579. Accompanied by Chief <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                                mission, I called on President Rhee yesterday afternoon to discuss
                                problems relating Korean goodwill mission to United States.</p>
                            <p>In course conversation, I informed Rhee I had just seen press release
                                issued under name Foreign Minister and Defense Minister (mytel 567,
                                May 19). I then reminded Rhee of statement he had once made to
                                effect worst thing could happen would be to have Pyongyang and
                                Moscow feel there lack understanding between Koreans and Americans.
                                    <pb n="1034" xml:id="pg_1034" facs="0448"/>I added I considered
                                above-mentioned press release as giving Communist propagandists
                                exactly type of ammunition they desire.</p>
                            <p>Rhee then inquired to what press release I referred and instructed
                                his secretary to obtain copy. After carefully reading release Rhee
                                said he had instructed Director Korean Office Public Information not
                                to issue any release without his advance approval. Rhee then
                                instructed his secretary to summon Foreign Minister and Defense
                                Minister at once. On their arrival a few minutes later Rhee curtly
                                requested that no press release be issued in future without his
                                approval. Defense Minister then inquired re nature of press release
                                under discussion and asked permission read it which he did
                                carefully. At this point Foreign Minister turned to me, said he
                                prepared release and inquired what wrong with it. I then repeated
                                statement made earlier to Rhee re Korean-American misunderstanding
                                etc. Foreign Minister thereupon flew into rage, declared United
                                States had sold China down river and were pursuing same course
                                respecting Korea. Both Rhee and Defense Minister were obviously
                                embarrassed at spectacle presented by Foreign Minister. In end Rhee
                                found it necessary ask him to calm himself.</p>
                            <p>This morning Defense Minister came to see me, saying he had been
                                directed by President Rhee to say latter distressed by Foreign
                                Minister’s outburst and to express Rhee’s regret.</p>
                            <p>I feel it obvious from what occurred Foreign Minister acted on his
                                own initiative. Foreign Minister has not seen fit contact me since
                                occurrence incident.</p>

                            <p>607. 1. Defense Minister Sihn and Transportation Minister Huh called
                                this morning and engaged me in conversation re US troop withdrawal.
                                While they did not say so, I am convinced they came at bidding of
                                President Rhee.</p>
                            <p>2. After considerable discussion they revealed purpose of call:
                                Namely, inquiry whether it possible delay departure <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> for additional six months.</p>
                            <p>3. Defense Minister expressed belief withdrawal <gloss
                                    target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> at this time would be followed at
                                once by North Korean invasion. He considered Korean Army not yet
                                completely cleansed of subversives and maintained he needed few
                                extra months for this purpose and for completion reorganization
                                Korean Army which recently initiated. He also appeared to doubt
                                whether Korean Army, as now constituted, trained, and supplied, is
                                adequate to meet all-out invasion from north. In event concerted
                                invasion, from north, he stated categorically, Korean Army <pb
                                    n="1035" xml:id="pg_1035" facs="0449"/>would need continuously
                                replenished supply munitions from US sources. Both Ministers
                                maintained people throughout South Korea uneasy over prospect
                                completion US troop withdrawal and desired retention US forces now
                                here.</p>
                            <p>4. I informed Ministers troop withdrawal program now too far advanced
                                to be halted and must go forward. I stressed fact troop withdrawal
                                implied no lessening of US support of or interest in Korea. I
                                reviewed existing and projected aid programs and reminded Ministers
                                    <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> being greatly strengthened
                                streamlined. I expressed belief, which I said shared by several
                                eminent ex-military officials, Korean Army well able handle security
                                Korea. I expressed belief North Koreans could not risk all-out
                                invasion South Korea, it would no doubt pursue current infiltration
                                activities. I pointed to splendid record achieved by Korean Task
                                Forces recently in Cheju and Chiri Mountains operations against
                                guerrillas and said I confident security forces now well capable of
                                coping with any such activity.</p>
                            <p>5. I went on to say I deplored publicity put out locally during past
                                two weeks on subject troop withdrawal. I said it my view such
                                publicity harmful in that it undermined Korean people’s confidence
                                in Government and security forces and tended prejudice advancement
                                Korean-US relations. I expressed opinion Korean publicity rather
                                should stress recent achievements government and security forces and
                                inculcate confidence among people.</p>
                            <p>6. It is my hope substance foregoing conversation will be passed on
                                to Rhee by his Ministers. I propose to see Rhee during next day or
                                two and convey similar views to him.</p>

                                my expectations. It now appears sense of crisis bordering on panic
                                has enveloped higher circles Korean Government which has in turn
                                spread to people at large. Among factors responsible are propaganda
                                line espoused by government directed at retention US troops, recent
                                troop and <gloss target="#t_YMS1">YMS</gloss> defections,<note n="1"

                            <p>Part 3. In view shaky situation here, we face several critical weeks,
                                worst of which may come about the time troop withdrawal
                                completed.</p>
                            <p>Part 4. I, therefore, feel we should do everything possible during
                                this critical period to bolster confidence of Korean Government and
                                public. I suggest for one thing no public announcement be made by
                                any US official agency giving completion date troop withdrawal and
                                avoiding where practicable reference withdrawal activities. On
                                positive side I suggest following measures:</p>

                            <p>Likening Korean situation to Greece, he referred to forces of 200,000

                                said he told Chough retention large US military force Korea did not
                                “mean much” and that statement committing US “stand by” Korea would
                                be more effective and preferable. Rhee also said if it ascertained
                                Chough made remarks attributed him regarding size and equipment
                                Korean security forces Rhee would instruct Chough to make

                                    >ECA</gloss> $60 million for the program up to February 15, 1950
                                (see P.L. 343, 81st Congress, October 10, 1949 and P.L. 430, 81st
                                Congress, October 28, 1949). Legislation authorizing the rest of the
                                $150 million was defeated in the House of Representatives on January
                                19, 1950, by a vote of 193–191. A Senate bill, amended to reduce the
                                appropriation to $60 million (for a total of $120 million in fiscal
                                year 1950) was, however, enacted into law on February 14, 1950 (see
                                P.L. 447, 81st Congress). The actual appropriation under this act
                                was not passed until June 29, 1950, and amounted to $50 million
                                (P.L. 583, 81st Congress). The total appropriation for economic aid
                                to Korea in fiscal year 1950 was thus $110 million. In addition,
                                P.L. 447 had provided for advances of up to $30 million for Korean

                            <p>A–196. 1. Reference is made to the Department’s A–68 April 13, 1949,
                                requesting this Mission’s comment on certain reports from an
                                unrevealed source concerning various potential political and
                                military developments in Korea.</p>
                            <p>2. With respect to source’s expectation that “serious trouble” would
                                develop within a 60-day period, in which the initiative would be
                                taken by the South Koreans, it would appear that this expectation
                                has not been borne out by actual developments. It is true, of
                                course, that there occurred during this period the defection of
                                elements of two battalions of the Eighth Regiment of the Korean
                                Army, the defection of a yard mine sweeper, and the Kaesong and
                                Ongjin incidents,<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2">Telegram 640, June 2,
                                    from Seoul (not printed) reported that during the period since
                                    May 28 fighting had been taking place on the Ongjin Peninsula
                                    following a penetration south of the 38th parallel by North
                                    Korean forces estimated at battalion strength. The telegram
                                    stated that the incident had received little publicity in Seoul
                                    and had not created undue alarm. The North Korean invasion
                                    seemed to be primarily a continuation of the war of nerves along
                                    the 38th parallel. (895.00/6–249)</note> but it would not appear
                                that any of the foregoing developments could be considered as in the
                                “serious trouble” category. Of course, these incidents had a
                                disconcerting, if not unsettling, effect, but none of them could be
                                regarded as comparable in scope or consequence with the Yosu–Sunchon
                                incident of October 1948. Although source’s prognostication is far
                                from specific, it would appear that he envisaged the mounting by
                                South Korea of an invasion of North Korea. In spite of a certain <pb

                                        become more critical during the past few months. In certain
                                        other respects, the situation would appear to be less
                                        critical. It is evident, for example, that the development
                                        of communistic guerrilla forces and bases in parts of South
                                        Korea, especially on Cheju Island and in the Chiri Mountains
                                        has been dealt a severe blow in consequence of the
                                        successful anti-guerrilla operations conducted by the Korean
                                        Army during the months of March, April and May. In certain
                                        other areas of South Korea, however, especially in South
                                        Cholla and North Kyongsang Provinces, this problem has not
                                        been solved so successfully, with result that small
                                        guerrilla bands continue to operate and commit depredations.
                                        From another point of view the reported withdrawal at the
                                        end of 1948 of Soviet forces from North Korea, taken in
                                        conjunction with the completion of the withdrawal of United
                                        States occupation forces by the end of June will leave two
                                        native Korean forces facing each other across the long line
                                        of the 38th parallel. Assuming withdrawal will be
                                        substantially completed, both on the part of the Americans
                                        and the Soviets, it will be apparent that the restraining
                                        influence hitherto exercised by the occupying powers will
                                        have been largely removed. Nevertheless it is the considered
                                        view of this Mission that neither South Korea nor North
                                        Korea, with what would appear to be fairly evenly balanced
                                        military forces, is likely in the foreseeable future to
                                        assume the risks associated with a deliberate all-out
                                        invasion. It will be clear, however, as indicated above,
                                        that the confrontation of hostile forces along the 38th
                                        parallel offers numerous opportunities for incidents,
                                        whether premeditated or unpremeditated, which might burgeon
                                        into all-out warfare. From this point of view, there can be
                                        no doubt that the military situation is assuming a more
                                        serious posture coincident with the withdrawal of the United
                                        States forces. It cannot be ruled out that the removal of
                                        the stabilizing force may in the end contribute to the
                                        initiation of a general conflict.</item>

                                    <item>Recent reports from North Korea suggest that North Korean
                                        military preparations are being appreciably intensified. It
                                        is consistently reported, for example, that the so-called
                                        “People’s Army” is being expanded (latest reports indicate
                                        an army of six divisions); that the training of the
                                        “People’s Army” has been and is continuous under the close
                                        supervision of Soviet advisors; and that a considerable
                                        effort is being made to strengthen the now small North
                                        Korean navy and air force. There is no evidence available
                                        that there has been any <hi rend="italic">substantial</hi>
                                        stockpiling of military equipment and supplies (which would
                                        obviously have to come from Soviet or Manchurian communist
                                        sources). Several recent reports from North Korea indicate,
                                        however, that the Soviets may have brought in some military
                                        equipment including a few Soviet manufactured planes, tanks
                                        and artillery. No reports have been received pointing to any
                                        important inflow into North Korea <pb n="1043"
                                            xml:id="pg_1043" facs="0457"/>of military equipment and
                                        supplies from Manchuria. In this connection, it may be
                                        recalled that the bulk of the Manchurian communist forces
                                        have been moved into China Proper, presumably with
                                        supporting military equipment. In the light of this reported
                                        movement, it seems doubtful whether Manchuria is at present
                                        in a position to supply any important amount of military
                                        equipment and supplies to North Korea. This Mission has
                                        received no information tending to support the report that
                                        plans are afoot to remove the capital of the Northern regime
                                        from Pyongyang to a point nearer Manchuria. The North Korean
                                        Army has during the past two or three years been erecting
                                        defensive fortifications north of the 38th parallel, and it
                                        would appear that this work continues. Earlier in the
                                        present year, numerous reports were received to the effect
                                        that pronounced defensive measures were being taken, such as
                                        the removal of military supplies and equipment to back
                                        areas; but more recent reports suggest a strengthening of
                                        North Korean military dispositions along and just back of
                                        the 38th parallel. According to reports available locally,
                                        the double-track railway line leading from the 38th parallel
                                        to Pyongyang has not been taken up, but only a short section
                                        of one track leading from the parallel north to the city of
                                        Nanchonjom [?].</item>

                                    <item>It is generally recognized, both in American and Korean
                                        circles, that the spirit and morale of the South Korean Army
                                        has increased appreciably during the past several months.
                                        This is the result of the steady growth of the Army,
                                        continuous training, improvement in organization and
                                        operating procedures, the gradual elimination of inefficient
                                        officers and subversives, etc. Moreover, the Army has
                                        achieved excellent results in operations against communist
                                        guerrilla forces which were strongly entrenched on Cheju
                                        Island and in the Chiri Mountains. On the other hand, the
                                        defections from the Eighth Regiment came as a disconcerting,
                                        if temporary shock. It is generally felt, from the overall
                                        point of view, that the Korean Army has made such progress
                                        during the past six months that it would give an excellent
                                        account of itself against the North Koreans.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>As has been reported from time to time, incidents continue
                                        to occur daily along the 38th parallel. Most of these
                                        incidents are of a minor character and possess no real
                                        significance. However, during the past six weeks two
                                        important incidents have occurred—those at Kaesong and at
                                        Ongjin. It now seems clear that both incidents were
                                        precipitated by the North Koreans. It would appear further
                                        that both incidents were local in character, despite the
                                        relatively large number of men engaged. In all probability,
                                        the North Koreans attacked either to test South Korean
                                        defenses and capabilities or to intensify the “war of
                                        nerves” which long has been prevalent along the parallel. No
                                        doubt, the future will see a continuation, if not an
                                        acceleration, of these border incidents.</item>

                                        disposition made of United States military materiel in Korea
                                        because the information requested in this connexion has not
                                        been supplied to it. The Sub-Committee has not, however,
                                        considered that it was essential to press for such
                                        information. The Ambassador of the United States has adduced
                                        considerations of military security affecting the Republic
                                        of Korea which appear to the Sub-Committee to be cogent.”

                                    escorted by Kim’s secretary to Kim’s reception room where Kim
                                    and An were closeted together for several minutes prior to
                                    shooting. An killed Kim with four shots from 45 caliber pistol.
                                    Following shooting assassin was mauled by Kim’s servants and
                                    bodyguards. He was subsequently handed over to Korean military

                                <item>Motive for shooting appears to lie in bitterness of An over
                                    Kim Koo’s professed policy of joint consultation with North

                            <p>Part 4. Since Kim Koo next to President Rhee perhaps best known
                                Korean to his people, his violent death naturally aroused much
                                consternation and fear. His assassination was almost universally
                                condemned and Kim mourned on every side as one who struggled
                                throughout his life for Korean independence. Many of Kim’s close
                                followers were reportedly in ugly mood following his demise, but
                                careful police and army precautions insured lack of disturbance.
                                Possibly funeral may be occasion for agitation but it believed
                                government fully capable of coping with situation.</p>

                                    from Korea on 30 June 1949 (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>

                                <p>6. On 27 December 1948 the USSR reported complete withdrawal of
                                    its occupation forces from Korea on 25 December 48 (Associated
                                    Press). There is evidence that the Soviets left 2000 military
                                    advisory personnel and 1000 security personnel in North
                                    Korea.</p>
                                <p>7. The United Nations Commission on Korea, on 23 May 1949, in
                                    referring to troop withdrawal, passed a resolution which in part
                                    states: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                            that under the General Assembly resolution of 12
                                            December 1948, this commission assumes no responsibility

                                    to facilitate the removal of barriers to economic, social and
                                    other friendly intercourse caused by the division of Korea; to
                                    observe and consult in the further development of representative
                                    government based on the freely expressed will of the peoples; to
                                    observe the actual withdrawal of the occupying forces and verify
                                    the fact of withdrawal when <pb n="1050" xml:id="pg_1050"

                                    two occupying powers. The resolution further called upon member
                                    states, the government of the Republic of Korea, and all Koreans
                                    to afford every sustenance and facility to the commission in the
                                    fulfillment of its responsibilities; called upon member states
                                    to refrain from any acts derogatory to the results achieved and
                                    to be achieved by the UN in bringing about the complete
                                    independence and unity of Korea; and recommended, that member
                                    states in establishing relations with the government of Korea,
                                    take into consideration that the government of the Republic of
                                    Korea has been established as a lawful government and that this
                                    is the only such government in Korea.</p>
                                <p>9. Through the Cairo Declaration of 1 December 1943 the United
                                    States, United Kingdom, and China agreed that “in due course
                                    Korea shall become free and independent.” The USSR became party
                                    to this commitment by adhering to the Potsdam Declaration when
                                    it declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945.<note n="5"

                                <p>The North Korean regime would find it hard to reject a genuine
                                    effort to achieve unification on an exclusively Korean basis
                                    without U.S. or Soviet interference. At least it would be
                                    deprived of an effective propaganda issue. If unification were
                                    actually achieved, the dislocations resulting from arbitrary
                                    division of the country at the 38th parallel would be eliminated
                                    and the development of a viable Korean economy and polity would
                                    be made possible. In any truly representative system the
                                    non-Communist majority should be able to maintain the
                                    independent and democratic character of Korea. It is improbable,
                                    however, that the North Korean regime, controlled from Moscow,
                                    would accept unification except in terms of a coalition
                                    government rigged to facilitate Communist infiltration and
                                    eventual domination of the entire country. It is equally
                                    improbable that Rhee, relying on UN recognition and U.S.
                                    support, would consent to compromise his position by initiating
                                    such negotiations with the North Korean regime. Rhee would
                                    probably denounce such a suggestion violently and publicly, with
                                    bitter reference to similar U.S. efforts in China in 1946, and
                                    the ultimate fate of the Chinese National Government.</p>

                                <p>Ambassador Muccio has recommended the visit of U.S. naval forces

                                <p>Apparently South Korean security forces are sufficiently
                                    organized, trained, and equipped to meet external aggression
                                    precipitated by North Korean armed forces as now constituted.
                                    Full scale invasion of South Korea by the North Koreans would
                                    indicate an all-out effort to acquire control and domination of
                                    the Korean peninsula. The Peoples’ Army of North Korea hardly
                                    retains the capability of sustained and comprehensive military
                                    operations without Chinese Communist and Soviet-Manchurian aid
                                    and support. If the U.S. does not adopt a course of action to
                                    counter full scale invasion by Communist forces, the Republic of
                                    Korea might be overthrown and the Korean peninsula lost to
                                    Communist domination by default. U.S. rehabilitation efforts and
                                    sponsorship of an independent Korea would then have been a
                                    fruitless undertaking. International recrimination would be far
                                    reaching to the effect that the U.S. had not fulfilled its
                                    public pronouncements to continue support to the Republic of
                                    Korea. Some course of action, therefore, would appear
                                    mandatory.</p>

                                    intervention and should be strictly one of internal dislocation
                                    which must be handled by the Korean authorities themselves. The
                                    South Korean security forces as now constituted possess the
                                    capability of coping with problems of internal order unless

                                    of the U.N., it is established under U.N. auspices and
                                    recognized by the U.N. It can bring its case before the Security
                                    Council under the terms of the charter. It may be necessary for
                                    the U.S. to sponsor such a move if the situation becomes
                                    intolerable. This course of action appears logical and

                                                briefly, is that Korea is of little strategic value
                                                to the United States and that any commitment to

                                                be ill-advised and impracticable in view of the

                                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff desire to emphasize
                                                that, as concluded in the study, the possible
                                                courses of action listed as 5<hi rend="italic"

                                                militarily unsound. The first of these, which
                                                envisages the introduction of a military task force
                                                into Korea composed of United States units and units
                                                of other member nations of the United Nations, would
                                                be practicable only if and when it has become
                                                possible to organize United Nations armed forces for
                                                the Security Council under the terms of Article 43
                                                of the United Nations Charter. The second of these
                                                possible courses of action would amount to
                                                reoccupation of South Korea. This, for reasons well
                                                stated in the study, would invite serious
                                                consequences while offering no tangible advantage.
                                                Furthermore, either course of action might lead to
                                                major military involvement.</item>

                                <item>It appears to me Lodge amendment is worded in such way as

                                    therefore, Lodge amendment might be taken as flying in face of

                            <p>Dr. Chough called on me by appointment this afternoon accompanied by
                                Ambassador Chang.</p>
                            <p>He stated at the outset that he wished to express to me, personally
                                and on behalf of his President, appreciation for the assistance
                                which had been extended to Korea by the United States, and in
                                particular for the strong advocacy of the Korean cause which had
                                been evidenced by recent official statements made in support of the
                                pending Korean Aid Bill.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Chough then stated that he had been instructed by President Rhee
                                to raise three points with me. In the first place, he stated that
                                the Korean Government and people had been disturbed by the recent
                                withdrawal of United States occupation forces because of what they
                                    <pb n="1059" xml:id="pg_1059" facs="0473"/>regarded as the
                                inadequacy of existing Korean security forces. He said that,
                                although this concern had been somewhat alleviated by recent
                                expressions of United States support, it continued to be the view of
                                his Government that the effective strength of the Korean Army (<hi
                                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the size of the force to be equipped and
                                supplied by the United States) should be raised from the present
                                figure of 65,000 to 100,000, with an additional reserve of 50,000.
                                He added that he had discussed this matter with General Wedemeyer
                                and that the latter, although originally in favor of the 65,000
                                figure, was now disposed to support the larger figure. (General
                                Wedemeyer has subsequently emphatically denied ever having expressed
                                himself, either to Dr. Chough or anyone else, as being in favor of a
                                Korean Army of more than 65,000 men.) Dr. Chough was informed in
                                reply that the question of Korea’s military requirements was one in
                                which we of course depended upon the judgment of our military
                                authorities, whose present opinion, in so far as it was known to us,
                                was that 65,000 was the optimum effective strength for the Korean
                                Army.</p>
                            <p>In the second place, Dr. Chough said that his Government was desirous
                                of some further public assurance on the part of the United States
                                that the latter would “stand by” the Republic of Korea in the event
                                of trouble. It was pointed out to Dr. Chough that the Department’s
                                statement of June 8 (Press Release No. 429)<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d268fn1">See Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Bulletin</hi>, June 19, 1949, p. 781.</note> had been
                                designed to meet the request of the Korean Government for a public
                                expression of United States support, and that no further statement
                                was contemplated at this time. Dr. Chough replied that, while all of
                                the recent statements of this Government had been most gratifying to
                                his Government, what they really wanted was a specific assurance
                                that the United States would come to the defense of the Republic of
                                Korea in the event of an armed attack against it. He was told that,
                                as he had already been informed on previous occasions, such a
                                specific military commitment by the United States was out of the
                                question.</p>
                            <p>The third point raised by Dr. Chough was the question of the
                                possibility of the United States’ underwriting a Pacific Pact
                                analogous to the North Atlantic Pact. I pointed out in reply that my
                                views on this subject had been set forth on more than one occasion
                                during recent press conferences, and that, in brief, the United
                                States did not at this time contemplate any further extension of the
                                undertakings embodied in the North Atlantic Pact.</p>

                                I expressed the doubt whether Dr. Rhee knew what Dr. Chough was
                                doing there in Washington. Here is an instance. This morning the
                                    <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> had a slug to the effect that
                                Dr. Chough had delivered to Secretary Acheson a message from
                                President Rhee that Korea needed an armed force of 400,000. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> correspondent called on Rhee
                                who expressed surprise at the figure 400,000 and said that this was
                                the first time he had heard that figure. Later in the day <gloss

                                    <p>The text read as follows:</p>
                                    <p>“<gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> 13, Washington. Korea
                                        Monday [June 11] proposed the arming of 400,000 men as a
                                        precaution against rash action by the Soviet sponsored North
                                        Korean regime. President Syngman Rhee made this proposal in
                                        a message delivered to Secretary of State Acheson by Korea’s
                                        UN representative, Dr. Chough Pyung Ok. Chough told
                                        reporters he explained to the Secretary that the vastly
                                        increased military force is a temporary program to last
                                        until North and South Korea are united. We feel North Korea
                                        might take drastic action against South Korea, he said.
                                        Chough said Rhee’s message suggested a fixed defense force
                                        of 100,000 Army, 50,000 police, 50,000 reserve police
                                        officers and a 200,000 man militia. The proposal for a
                                        400,000 man military force would in effect quadruple Korea’s
                                        present military strength. Most reports have put Soviet
                                        trained North Korean forces at around 200,000 men. The UN
                                        envoy said President Rhee’s message appealed for some kind
                                        of assurance that Korea might be looked after in case of
                                        foreign aggression or foreign inspired domestic troubles. It
                                        also made the point, he added, that Korea would like some
                                        form of collective security in Asia. Chough disclosed that
                                        he is going to Ottawa Friday to discuss political and
                                        economic matters with the Canadian Government. He declined
                                        to explain in detail, but said he hoped Korea might expand
                                        her trade with Canada.”</p>
                                </note> was received and the correspondent phoned the President’s
                                secretary and gave him the breakdown given therein. It would appear
                                therefore that either Rhee is holding out on the correspondent, and
                                me, or Chough is playing his own little game.</p>
                            <p>The Korean security forces now are up to 76,953 Army, 5,433 Coast
                                Guard, and 50,484 police. Recently while talking with President Rhee
                                I emphatically cautioned against expanding the security forces too
                                rapidly and reiterated what General Wedemeyer told both Rhee and Lee

                                here was a small, compact, well-trained and equipped force
                                thoroughly loyal. I pointed out—that if the expansion was too
                                rapid—the danger of subversive infiltration and of having to use
                                loyal forces at this critical juncture to control disloyal elements
                                within his own ranks. He mumbled that he appreciated this and agreed
                                with me thoroughly and that he would tell them to hold up recruiting
                                for awhile. Recruiting for the reserve, <pb n="1061"
                                    xml:id="pg_1061" facs="0475"/>now slightly over 30,000, was
                                discontinued. The army is already close to 100,000 if to the above
                                figure, we add the number of enlistees awaiting examination,
                                screening, etc. before formal enrollment. I have heard of a desire

                                reserve of 50,000.</p>
                            <p>When I took Lasher up to call on Rhee day before yesterday, Rhee
                                launched off on the need for improving and increasing the army and
                                said that they needed 100,000 army and 200,000 militia. There is no
                                doubt that there is real apprehension, if not outright fear, still
                                existing in many segments of the population and especially in the
                                inner government circle. Their every thought in May and up until
                                towards the end of June was the inevitability of a clash and the
                                need to prepare therefor. This fear is probably not as acute as it
                                was last month though it still pervades a great deal of their
                                thinking. They are still feverishly eager to do everything to
                                increase their security forces. I am sending you a separate letter
                                on the juggling now going on here to obtain planes.<note n="5"

                                        <p>Ambassador Muccio’s letter crossed one dated July 14 from
                                            Mr. Bond wherein the latter enclosed a copy of the July
                                            11 memorandum of conversation by the Secretary of State.
                                            The final two paragraphs of Mr. Bond’s letter read as
                                            follows:</p>
                                        <p>“Although Chough has been getting pretty short shrift
                                            around here of late, his free-wheeling efforts to put
                                            the squeeze on us for military assistance continue to be
                                            a source of some irritation. (Following his conversation
                                            with the Secretary he told the press that Korea should
                                            be provided with an Army, militia, and police force
                                            totaling 400,000 men.) Although we have endeavored
                                            discreetly to impress upon the Ambassador that Chough’s
                                            activities are definitely <hi rend="italic"
                                                >contraproducente</hi> in terms of the best
                                            interests of his Government, he continues to go his
                                            merry way. I doubt, however, if Chough will hereafter
                                            get to see any top people either in State or Army on any
                                            matters relating to military assistance.</p>
                                        <p>“With reference to the penultimate paragraph of the
                                            enclosed memorandum of conversation, I may add that
                                            following that conversation I gave Chough a copy of our
                                            June 8 statement, which he admitted he had never read
                                            carefully. He phoned me the following day to say that he
                                            had now read it with care and that he regarded it as a
                                            fine, strong statement, inferring that had he read it
                                            before he would not have raised with the Secretary the
                                            question of a further statement.” (895.20/7–1349)</p>

                                    newsmen and the question of press censorship. Regarding the five
                                    newsmen, Mr. Rhee said that he did not want the incident
                                    included in <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>’s report to

                                    criticism of the Republic of Korea Government. Newspapers, he
                                    said, should be allowed to carry critical articles, provided
                                    that they did not support or praise the U.S.S.R. and thus assist

                                security and fight for existence against Communist aggression in its

                                of these activities, Korean Government feels justified in taking

                            <p>Since it is United States policy to support the Republic of Korea
                                diplomatically, economically, and militarily, I consider it of prime
                                importance that the United Nations, and specifically the General
                                Assembly, should remain seized with the Korean problem and that
                                either the present Commission, or a new one, should remain in Korea.
                                It is my view that the United Nations should continue to be involved
                                in the Korean problem to such extent as is possible. The tendency to
                                view the Korean problem, even in the present United Nations
                                Commission, as a U.S.–U.S.S.R. conflict not of basic concern to
                                other nations should be discouraged and checked.</p>
                            <p>Apart from evidencing the moral responsibility of the United Nations
                                to Korea, the primary value of the United Nations Commission is to
                                serve as a barrier to communist aggression. The fact that a United
                                Nations Commission is in Korea, and that the General Assembly has
                                given its blessings to the Republic of Korea, has exercised a
                                profound influence on both sides of the 38th parallel. It seems that
                                the Soviets and their Korean puppets would hesitate to commit
                                themselves to overt aggression against the Republic of Korea so long
                                as there is a United Nations body observing and reporting on the
                                situation in Korea. In my opinion, the Commission on Korea, whether
                                the present or a new one, should be given responsibility for
                                observing and reporting on military activities as a primary term of
                                reference.</p>
                            <p>The chief reasons for this opinion are: (1) Recently increased
                                military activity in the vicinity of the 38th parallel and the
                                possibility of <pb n="1069" xml:id="pg_1069" facs="0483"/>the
                                outbreak of serious incidents at any time; (2) in the event of such
                                incidents, the value of neutral reporting on such occurrences in
                                obtaining support of world opinion and friendly governments for U.S.
                                policy in Korea; (3) the pessimism, often amounting to hostility, of
                                the members of the Commission and its Secretariat, because of their
                                inability to carry out the present terms of reference regarding
                                Korean unification; (4) the unanimous conviction of the delegates of
                                the present Commission as expressed privately that such a
                                responsibility should become a major term of reference for the
                                Commission in the resolution to be adopted on Korea at the Fourth
                                General Assembly.</p>
                            <p>I should like to urge that the United States delegation at Lake
                                Success be instructed to support a proposal looking to continuation
                                of the present Commission, or the establishment of a new Commission
                                along similar lines, and to oppose any proposals that might be made
                                looking to the creation of a High Commissioner, responsible to the
                                Secretary General of the United Nations. Such a proposal is being
                                pressed actively by the <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>
                                Secretariat. However, such proposal does not appear in general to
                                have the support of the <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>
                                delegates.</p>
                            <p>It is my considered opinion that the major value of the Commission
                                lies in its representation not only of the General Assembly but of
                                the several sovereign governments to which the delegates report
                                directly. In both the UNTCOK and in <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                    >UNCOK</gloss>, the Secretariat has been a major problem. In
                                many instances the Secretariat has supported policies and theses
                                inimical to United States interests in Korea. It may be pointed out
                                that a High Commissioner would presumably be responsible solely to
                                the United Nations Secretary General, while no sovereign government,
                                apart perhaps from the United States and the U.S.S.R., would
                                continue to have an immediate interest or responsibility in Korea.
                                The opportunities for an unfriendly Secretariat responsible solely
                                to the High Commissioner or to the United Nations Secretary General
                                to do harm to United States interests would seem to be greater than
                                when they are at least partially controlled by delegates
                                representing sovereign states largely friendly to the United States.
                                The situation in Korea, as relates to the function of a UN
                                Commission, seems more analagous to Greece than to Palestine.</p>
                            <p>If the Department were able to persuade a friendly Government
                                represented on the Commission to appoint a man of outstanding
                                ability and experience to serve in Korea, in my opinion this action
                                would contribute materially to the success of the next Commission
                                and to support of United States interests. In all probability such a
                                man would be elected permanent chairman of the UN Commission, giving
                                it leadership and continuity of program and action, both of which
                                have been markedly missing in the present Commission. The
                                Secretariat, furthermore, could be expected to be subordinated to
                                the views and leadership of the Permanent Chairman, instead of
                                exercising leadership itself.</p>

                                        on Korea of December 12, 1948, although two members, Dr. Liu

                                        internal affairs. According to Mr. Jamieson, Australia, it
                                        never occurred to <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>
                                        that the reference to the Resolution of November 14, 1947
                                        was a call for UN supervised elections in North Korea.
                                        Instead <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> viewed it as
                                        a 1948 call upon <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> to
                                        mediate between the North and South Korean Governments. He
                                        implied that this was particularly due to the
                                        interpretations supplied by the Secretariat, since the
                                        delegates lacked adequate instructions and interpretations

                                <p>The Commission made earnest efforts to establish contact with Kim
                                    Il Sung’s regime, and they feel aggrieved and distressed by
                                    their failure. A part of this disappointment they possibly
                                    reflect in criticism of the Korean Government for its failure
                                    practically to assist in a solution of the unification

                                <p>The conclusions consist of a five-paragraph preamble, largely of
                                    generalities, and five numbered paragraphs of conclusions.</p>
                                <p>Two paragraphs (no. 3 and 5) are not helpful to the U.S.
                                    position. No. 3 attributes the underlying difficulties in Korea
                                    to U.S.–U.S.S.R. antagonisms. “Without a new effort by these
                                    powers to reach an agreement . . . . on Korea, no substantial
                                    progress . . . . can be made.” Acceptance of this thesis would
                                    throw the problem back to the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. instead of
                                    the UN continuing to be seized of the problem, as it has been
                                    since November 14, 1947. The U.S. can hardly accept this thesis.
                                    Paragraph 5 states that the “.… situation in Korea is now no
                                    better than it was at the beginning and . . . . (the Commission)
                                    . . . . has not been able to facilitate the objectives set by
                                    the General Assembly.” Elsewhere the report tells of the
                                    successful establishment and functioning of the Korean
                                    Government, democratic tendencies in the National Assembly and
                                    the like, but this flat denial in the conclusions of any
                                    improvement from the beginning is harmful.</p>
                                <p>M. Costilhes, France, has said privately that this paragraph
                                    referred to unification. The language of the paragraph however
                                    does not clearly show this, and therefore lends itself to
                                    adverse interpretations. It can be expected that the Russians
                                    will exploit it fully.</p>
                                <p>Paragraph 1 states, accurately, that the prospect of unification
                                    becomes more and more remote. Paragraph 2 is critical of the
                                    U.S.S.R. and is therefore helpful to the U.S. position.
                                    Paragraph 4, while grudgingly admitting the difficulties facing
                                    the Republic of Korea, including uprisings and border clashes,
                                    expresses the view “.… that a broadening of the Government’s
                                    political base would allow it to meet these difficulties more
                                    successfully.…” This appears both to be a rendering of judgment
                                    outside the terms of reference of the Commission, and a charge
                                    so vaguely made that it can be well used by the Soviets.</p>
                                <p>At Lake Success, the <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss>
                                    should be prepared to expand on certain subjects reported on in
                                    the <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> report and to
                                    challenge some statements. Nevertheless, for tactical reasons,
                                    it would seem necessary to accept the whole report, in the
                                    Resolution. Otherwise the U.S. would be in a position of
                                    attacking <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> wihch would
                                    seem to be tactically unsound.</p>

                                <p>Certain parts of the report, prior to the conclusions, are
                                    strongly worded criticisms of the Soviet-Communist positions (IV
                                    paragraphs 3, 6, 7, 8, 20, 2d part; 21, 26, 27, 29). They can be
                                    exploited to good effect in debate, and in drafting a Resolution
                                    on Korea.</p>
                                <p>Most of the paragraphs of Chapter 4 not listed above are either
                                    not helpful or are actually damaging to the U.S. position on
                                    Korea. Chapter 3, chiefly a factual account of events, is
                                    largely written in a sympathetic manner and could be used with
                                    good effect by the <gloss target="#t_USDel1">USDel</gloss> to
                                    offset the damaging material in Chapter 4.</p>
                                <p>One reason for this poorly drafted report was the lack of strong
                                    leadership in <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>. Last year
                                    such leadership was exercised by both the Chinese and French
                                    representatives. It would seem highly desirable that in
                                    connection with the next Commission efforts should be made to
                                    persuade a government friendly to the United States to send a
                                    first class man to Korea. The proposed draft Resolution attached
                                    hereto calls for a permanent <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                        >UNCOK</gloss> chairman. It is hoped that such a man would
                                    secure election by virtue of his recognized abilities.</p>
                                <p>The Secretariat headed by Dr. Ranshofen-Wertheimer and assisted
                                    by Mr. Sanford Schwarz, has had exaggerated ideas of its
                                    importance. The same was true of the UNTCOK Secretariat, but M.
                                    Paul-Boncour was able to keep in check the Principal Secretary,
                                    Dr. Schmidt, until his replacement, Mr. Binnertz. No one has
                                    been able to keep the present Secretariat in check and their
                                    influence on the Commission has been out of proportion to their
                                    proper functions. A recent minor illustration of the successful
                                    claims of the Secretariat occurred at the August 15 ceremonies,
                                    when Mr. Schwarz, Deputy Principal Secretary, was seated to
                                    outrank all Commission members including the Chairman.</p>
                                <p>Excepting M. Costilhes, France, all members of <gloss
                                        target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> seem disturbed and
                                    dispirited at their complete failure to bring about unification
                                    of Korea. Even Dr. Liu and Dr. Luna, who were well aware at
                                    Paris that the three sponsoring governments did not expect
                                        <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> to be successful in
                                    bringing about unification but rather were desirous that there
                                    should be a Commission in Korea as a moral obstacle to Communist
                                    aggression, seemed distressed at their failure. The delegates,
                                    through separate conversations with an officer of this Embassy,
                                    have urged that the new Resolution should not contain any terms
                                    of reference which patently could not be carried out. They think
                                    it would be especially harmful to call upon a new Commission to
                                    bring about unification. When it was suggested to them that the
                                    paramount UN interest in Korea is to bring about independence
                                    and unification, and the failure to include such provisions in
                                    the terms of reference would mark a UN retreat, they remained
                                    unconvinced, M. Costilhes, France, suggested that they be
                                    included in a preamble but not be made a part of the terms of
                                    reference.</p>
                                <pb n="1073" xml:id="pg_1073" facs="0487"/>
                                <p>All Commission members agree that the primary duty of the new
                                    Commission should be observation, and reporting on military
                                    activities hostile to the Korean Government, including armed
                                    subversion. They believe such functions would justify a new
                                    Commission in its own eyes, would keep it busy and could be a
                                    real contribution toward preserving the peace or at least
                                    informing the world on Communist activities in Korea.</p>
                                <p>The Secretariat is anxious to have the Commission abandoned and
                                    replaced by a High Commissioner appointed by and responsible to
                                    the Secretary General. Their argument appears to be that the;
                                    Korean problem is a contest between two antagonistic governments
                                    which a UN High Commissioner can best mediate, as Dr. Bunche
                                    mediated the Arab-Jewish conflict. It is believed, however, that
                                    the Secretariat would expect to have a freer hand in a UN <gloss
                                        target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> body than in one made up of
                                    representatives of several sovereign states. Although some
                                    delegates have been impressed with the arguments of the
                                    Secretariat, no one seems to have committed himself to support
                                    the proposal, while the representatives of France, Philippines
                                    and El Salvador are flatly opposed.</p>
                                <p>Since U.S. interests seem best served by the continued interest
                                    of the largest number of governments in Korea, the substitution
                                    of a High Commissioner, no matter how distinguished, responsible
                                    only to the UN Secretary General, would seem to be contrary to
                                    U.S. interests. Furthermore, the U.N. Secretariat in Korea is
                                    frequently more hostile than helpful both to U.S. interests and
                                    the Korean Government, Without governmental representatives to
                                    check the Secretariat, it might do great harm.</p>
                                <p>There seems no possibility of successful mediation between North
                                    and South. In fact, such mediation, if possible and successful,
                                    might be very harmful to U.S. interests by preparing the way for
                                    communists to enter the Korean Government. The situation in
                                    Korea is analagous to Greece in which UN observers report on
                                    aggressive activities of guerrillas and the neighbors of Greece
                                    but do not serve as mediators between the Greek Government and
                                    the communist rebels.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> has suffered by the
                                    absence of the Syrian delegate, Mr. Mughir who only remained in
                                    Korea about six weeks. (In 1948, Mr. Mughir absented himself
                                    from the Commission in May.) The purpose of the 1948 Resolution
                                    to have an odd numbered Commission, seven, for voting purposes,
                                    was defeated thereby. Mr. Mughir, before leaving, delivered a
                                    speech before <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> severely
                                    excoriating the Korean Government. While nominally suppressed,
                                    it seems likely that the Soviets will obtain a copy of his
                                    statement. By the conduct of its representative in two
                                    successive conferences, Syria would seem to have forfeited any
                                    claim to a position on a third Commission. If Turkey <pb
                                        n="1074" xml:id="pg_1074" facs="0488"/>is still willing to
                                    serve, as she was in 1948, it would seem desirable to replace
                                    Syria with Turkey on the next Commission.</p>
                                <p>For other reasons, it seems desirable that El Salvador should be
                                    replaced by a larger Latin American country, such as Brazil or
                                    Mexico. El Salvador lacks sufficient experienced Foreign Service
                                    personnel and, in addition, because of the country’s small size,
                                    the views of its delegate do not receive the attention shown
                                    those expressed by the representative of a larger Latin American
                                    state.</p>
                                <p>The criticisms of the Korean Government in chapter 4 are largely
                                    offset by the report in chapter 3. The criticisms are chiefly
                                    that: (1) the Korean Government is hostile to the idea of
                                    unification, (2) it looks upon the 1948 Resolution as a support
                                    to its claims over all Korea; (3) it leads a divided people; and
                                    (4) it would face its problems better by broadening the base of
                                    the government. None of these criticisms seem very cogent. In a
                                    few days, the Korean Government is expected to send a letter to
                                        <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> urging it again to
                                    try to act under the Resolution of November 14, 1947 as called
                                    for on December 12, 1948, to determine representatives in a UN
                                    supervised elections in North Korea who may be seated in the
                                    National Assembly. The letter will reiterate the great anxiety
                                    of the Korean Government for unification under UN auspices.
                                    However unrealistic this request may appear to be in the light
                                    of present circumstances, this letter nevertheless should be
                                    helpful in meeting the charge of hostility to unification.</p>
                                <p>At Paris, the Korean representative stated in Committee I that
                                    his Government considered all Korea the territory of the
                                    Republic. The position of the Korean Government since the
                                    arrival of <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss>, therefore,
                                    is not new. It seems to be the privilege of the Korean
                                    Government to advance such a claim and of the General Assembly
                                    to ignore it.</p>
                                <p>The claim that the people in South Korea are divided is
                                    unsubstantiated. Currently the only practical tests seem to be:
                                    the May 10, 1948 elections; the loyalty of officials, police and
                                    the army to the Government; and the new elections which will be
                                    held next year.</p>
                                <p>Pending the 1950 elections, it would seem improper for <gloss
                                        target="#t_UNCOK1">UNCOK</gloss> or the General Assembly to
                                    pass judgment on the broad or narrow base of the Korean
                                    Government. By the same token, the selection of a government
                                    under the Korean constitution would seem a matter solely for
                                    Korean determination. In any case, this phrase regarding a
                                    broadened base seems to lack any precise meaning.</p>
                                <p>Having completed its report, <gloss target="#t_UNCOK1"
                                        >UNCOK</gloss> has turned itself into a Working Committee

                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I wish at this time to bring
                                to your attention some of the serious problems which are troubling
                                me and the Korean people. As I sit in my home not much more than
                                thirty miles from positions where soldiers of the Republic are
                                defending with their lives the soil and the people of Korea against
                                savage assaults of Communist armies, my thoughts most naturally turn
                                to our grievous problems of defense. As President and
                                Commander-in-Chief it is my responsibility to face those problems,
                                and God willing, to find solutions for them. Unless I, and my
                                Government, with the aid of our friends, do find solutions, the
                                immediate future for our nation is bleak and bloody.</p>
                            <p>I trust, therefore, that you will pardon my request that you again
                                consider the question of military aid after you yourself, and the
                                great nation which you lead have already shown such sympathy and
                                generosity to my country.</p>
                            <p>Mr. President, with the able advice of your Military Advisory Group,
                                we have been training a small, competent, compact army. We Koreans,
                                however, who have to face the Communist forces to the North of us,
                                do not believe that our army is adequately supplied with ammunition
                                for the battles which it must face. The coming six weeks are the
                                most critical time.</p>
                            <p>Some American advisers assure me the Communists will never attack in
                                force, and therefore we may rest easily, defended by our brave army.
                                But how do these advisers know for certain? We Koreans believe that
                                the Communists, under Soviet direction, intend to attack in force,
                                that they will do so, and, if they do, it is we, the Koreans,
                                civilian and military, who will pay the price, not the goodwilled
                                American advisers. In fact they have started attacking us in various
                                points.</p>
                            <p>I have stated before, and I state categorically again, that the
                                Republic of Korea will not attack the territory north of the 38th
                                parallel. But if the Communist forces do make an all out attempt to
                                drive south and capture our capital, we shall use every strength we
                                possess not only to defeat them and hurl them back, but also to
                                attack their retreating <pb n="1076" xml:id="pg_1076" facs="0490"
                                />forces and in so doing to liberate our enslaved fellow countrymen
                                in the north.</p>
                            <p>Mr. President, I beg that you will consider again the very great
                                danger of Communist assault in the immediate future. American
                                officers tell me we have sufficient ammunition for two months of
                                combat; my own officers tell me it is only sufficient for two days.
                                I am not a soldier and cannot determine these facts with accuracy,
                                but I am convinced that the American advisers are thinking in terms
                                of piecemeal warfare, whereas we Koreans believe that when war comes
                                it will be full scale and total. We must have at present the
                                necessary arms and ammunitions as quoted in the enclosed list.<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>The soldiers of the Republic are brave and loyal; they are skilled in
                                the arts of war in no small degree because of American training and
                                equipment. But, Mr. President, they must not be left without
                                adequate supply of arms and munitions.</p>
                            <p>I have taken the liberty of writing you in a hurry since our defense
                                problems are in a most critical situation. When the military aid
                                bill is passed by Congress, I am sure you will make a maximum
                                allotment for Korea. I am preparing a separate list for overall
                                military aid that Korea will need. But what I appeal for in this
                                letter is only what we must have on hand now for the protection of
                                our defenseless citizens of the south.</p>
                            <p>With sincere regards and highest personal esteem,</p>
                            <p>Most sincerely yours,</p>

                                contrast with the First Session, which began on September 8, 1948,
                                is striking.</p>
                            <p>At the opening session, in addition to Premier Kim Il Sung, Presidium
                                President Kim Do Bong and Presidium Vice Chairman Kim Hal Hyung, all
                                the Ministers of state and members of the Presidium are reported to
                                have attended. (It is believed, however, that Hu Hun is in Moscow at
                                present.) Among the guests was the Soviet Minister Counselor Tunkin.
                                Ambassador Shtikov was not mentioned. Possibly he is ill or in
                                Russia for consultation.</p>
                            <p>The chief items of business at the first session, September 8, were
                                the announcement of the agenda, and the speech by Kim Il Sung. The
                                agenda as announced was: (1) Government statement on achievements of
                                the past year of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; (2)
                                Consideration of enforcement of universal compulsory education law;
                                (3) Consideration of income tax law; (4) Consideration of a law
                                against counterfeiting North Korea bank notes.</p>
                            <p>Kim Il Sung’s speech represented the first, item on the agenda. He
                                spoke for about an hour, describing the achievements of the Korean
                                People’s Democracy in its first year of existence. He made the usual
                                attacks on the United States, the anti-communist South Koreans and
                                the UN Commission, but added no new phrases or ideas. Compared to
                                past speeches his address might be considered mild. A considerable
                                portion of his speech was devoted to claims of great advances in
                                industry, commerce, education and government, and contrary claims
                                for South Korea.</p>
                            <p>Kim Il Sung ended his address with a four point program, abbreviated
                                as follows: <list>

                                        the People’s enemies of their foothold, thereby realizing
                                        peaceful unification.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>In his peroration Kim Il Sung claimed the “People’s democratic
                                system” was steadily winning in Europe and in Asia, so that the
                                international situation is favorable to his cause.</p>
                            <p>The second day, September 9, was devoted chiefly to “debates” on Kim
                                Il Sung’s speech, and Vice Premier Hong Myung Hi’s presentation of
                                the Cabinet’s proposals for enforcement of the laws on universal
                                compulsory education. These “debates” consisted of statements by
                                fifteen “government” and other leaders, in support of Kim Il Sung’s
                                address. A Resolution endorsing the address was then put and adopted
                                unanimously.</p>
                            <pb n="1078" xml:id="pg_1078" facs="0492"/>
                            <p>The third day, September 10, was devoted to “debating” and
                                unanimously resolving to adopt (1) the proposed law on compulsory
                                universal education, a law covering children from seven to fifteen,
                                but permitting delay in enforcement, (2) the income tax law; and (3)
                                the law against forging of North Korea bank notes.</p>
                            <p>Each of the Resolutions was very brief, proposing to adopt a given
                                law, but the law itself was not included in the Resolution. Each
                                Resolution was adopted unanimously.</p>
                            <p>No mention was made at any time of the prospective September 20 all
                                Korea “elections” to be organized by the “Democratic Front”. The
                                “Democratic Front” was often referred to but not in connection with
                                “elections”. At this date of writing Pyongyang Radio has still
                                failed to mention the September 20 “elections”, which have not been
                                mentioned over the air since July.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">See
                                    footnote 2, <ref target="#pg_1064">p. 1064</ref>.</note> It is
                                assumed, therefore, that the “elections” either have been postponed
                                or shelved indefinitely. Rumors and unverified reports to the former
                                effect have been received at the Embassy since about September
                                1.</p>
                            <p>Since the “elections” are not a necessary part of the governmental
                                process, but serve primarily as a propaganda device to support a
                                particular policy decision, two estimates for the reasons behind the
                                projected September 20 elections were that they were to support (1)
                                an invasion of South Korea soon after September 20, or (2) the
                                Russian tactical position at Lake Success, or (3) both. Current U.S.
                                military intelligence estimates do not support (1). It is assumed,
                                therefore, that (2) was the basis for “elections” on September 20.
                                It is now considered possible that the Soviets in reevaluating their
                                prospective position at Lake Success came to the conclusion that new
                                elections to prove the validity of a “government” whose validity
                                they had already proved in 1948 by reference to alleged universal,
                                popular Korean elections might hurt rather than help their case.</p>
                            <p>It seems possible, therefore, that the “elections” have not merely
                                been postponed but postponed indefinitely. The period from October
                                11 to October 21 has been declared “Soviet-Korean Friendship Week”,
                                when numerous Soviet artists and intellectuals will be in Pyongyang
                                and numerous Koreans of similar type in Moscow. It seems unlikely
                                that a simultaneous propaganda campaign, for Soviet-Korean
                                friendship, and for universal “elections”, could be conducted
                                successfully. After October 21, there would be no point in
                                “elections” to bolster the Soviet case at Lake Success. “Elections”
                                after October 21 might be helpful only to support claims leading to
                                a campaign to “liberate” South Korea. Current United States military
                                intelligence estimates do not support such an estimate of the
                                situation, although should presently numerous but quite unverified
                                reports of entrance of Chinese <pb n="1079" xml:id="pg_1079"
                                    facs="0493"/>communist forces into North Korea be verified, this
                                estimate might change. Snow flies in Seoul before or about
                                Thanksgiving and is on the ground earlier in Pyongyang. An
                                “election” to give propaganda support to such a campaign would have
                                to be held soon after October 21, if that campaign were not to
                                become a winter battle.</p>
                            <p>None of these estimates can be considered as more than of the most
                                tentative nature, but the failure of the Fourth Session of the
                                Supreme People’s Assembly, or Pyongyang Radio, since it adjourned,
                                to mention elections gives them some basis of support.</p>
                            <p>Upon adjournment, the members of the Supreme People’s Assembly are
                                reported to have dispersed to their homes under orders from the
                                Supreme Presidium to inform their constituents of the work done and
                                the information gained at the Session.</p>

                                of $10,000,000, exclusive of transportation charges.</p>
                            <p>General Roberts’ recommendations were necessarily prepared within the
                                limits of the $10,000,000 figure. Attention is invited to the
                                concluding sentence of his letter to me expressing the opinion that
                                the “request outlined herein is the absolute minimum with which the
                                Korean Security Forces can be expected to maintain internal quiet
                                and to secure the existing boundaries”. In this connection, I should
                                like to point out that, in the unfortunate event of the outbreak of
                                large-scale hostilities between North and South Korea, the over-all
                                amount of $10,000,000 would obviously be inadequate to keep the
                                security forces of the Republic of Korea in the field for any
                                extended period of time.</p>

                            <p>With regard to General Roberts’ recommendations respecting the
                                furnishing of naval vessels to Korea, it is my earnest hope that the
                                $500,000 recommended to be set aside can be used to purchase a
                                number of surplus or second-hand patrol craft, submarine chasers,
                                and high-speed Diesel Picket boats. In other words, I hope that
                                means can be found to spread the use of the $500,000 for the
                                purchase of a number of vessels and not have it limited to the
                                purchase of a single new craft.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the question of military aircraft for the Republic
                                of Korea, it will be noted that General Roberts has recommended that
                                expenditures be limited to $26,956 for the purchase of seven L–4
                                aircraft and spare parts. It will be obvious that L-type aircraft
                                cannot be regarded as constituting the basis for the building up of
                                a small but efficient air force. This is keenly felt by the Korean
                                authorities, who have gone so far as to authorize the expenditure of
                                some $200,000 for the purchase of ten AT–6 trainer aircraft. The
                                Korean authorities are desirous of augmenting the L-type aircraft
                                and the AT–6 type aircraft with a few military craft of a higher
                                performance. In this connection, recent and persistent reports from
                                north Korea suggest that the Soviets are supplying the north Koreans
                                with a relatively sizable number of comparatively high-performance
                                military aircraft. At this time our intelligence agencies are making
                                a special effort to obtain a reliable and clear report regarding the
                                present strentgh of the north Korean air arm. Should it be
                                confirmed, as now seems indicated, that the north Koreans are hi
                                possession of military aircraft giving them a greater superiority,
                                it will then be necessary to consider steps looking to the
                                strengthening of the air arm of the Republic of Korea. It is
                                expected that as soon as a reliable picture of the North Korean air
                                force becomes available, a report with our recommendations will be
                                submitted to Washington respecting the desirability of increasing
                                the strength of the Korean air force.</p>

                                <item>Reportedly, a Chinese official, Dr. K. C. Wu, a former vice
                                    minister of foreign affairs and mayor of Shanghai, conferred
                                    with Korean Premier Lee Bum Suk, Foreign Minister Ben C. Limb
                                    and Admiral Son Won Il of the Korean Navy during the course of
                                    the Chinhae conference. Possibly Chinese apart from Wu were
                                    present at the discussions, but if so the Embassy is not so
                                    informed. Wu is said to have proposed at the discussions that
                                    the Chinese be given air base facilities on Cheju Island—about
                                    fifty miles off the south coast of Korea—where the Chinese would
                                    base three fighter-bomber groups for the purpose of attacking
                                    the Shantung peninsula and the terminus of the Lunghai railway
                                    (Haichow). The Chinese proposed that the Koreans supply naval
                                    security for Cheju Island and reportedly inquired as to the
                                    capabilities of the Korean Navy. In response, Admiral Son gave a
                                    complete account of Korean ships and their capabilities. The
                                    Chinese expressed surprise and disappointment over what they
                                    considered to be the weakness of the Korean Navy. The Koreans
                                    reportedly asked what naval protection the Chinese could offer
                                    and were told “none”. According to information available to the
                                    Embassy the Korean Foreign Minister and Admiral Son did most of
                                    the talking for the Korean side, with the Korean Premier largely
                                    silent. The Koreans reportedly raised the question of gasoline
                                    supply for the Chinese planes, and the Chinese are reported to
                                    have said that they would supply gasoline from stocks made
                                    available to them by the United States.</item>

                                <item>There is some indication that the foregoing conversation took
                                    place without the express authorization of President Rhee.
                                    Following the conversation the Foreign Minister is said to have
                                    related the gist of the conversations to the President who
                                    immediately took the view that an assignment of air bases on
                                    Cheju for the purposes indicated would be tantamount to
                                    involving Korea directly in the Chinese civil war. Reportedly
                                    the Korean Foreign Minister told Dr. Wu that Korea could not
                                    afford to be dragged into the Chinese conflict without adequate
                                    air power to cover the Korean Army against Chinese communist
                                    retaliation. In any case the Korean Government would not make
                                    the desired bases available. The Korean Foreign Minister is then
                                    reported to have inquired, presumably on the President’s
                                    instructions, what air support the Chinese could render if the
                                    Korean Army invaded north Korea. Dr. Wu reportedly replied that
                                    the Chinese could supply one fighter-bomber group. The Foreign
                                    Minister, and presumably the <pb n="1082" xml:id="pg_1082"
                                        facs="0496"/>Premier, reported to President Rhee that the
                                    Chinese proposals appeared to be beneficial to China but not to
                                    Korea. President Rhee is believed to have concurred in this view
                                    and to continue now to entertain this conviction.</item>

                                <item>The conversations between Dr. Wu and the Koreans reportedly
                                    collapsed with no agreement or understanding. It is reliably
                                    understood that during the Rhee–Chiang conversations, the
                                    subject of the use by the Chinese of Korean air bases was not
                                    touched upon. Evidently, the course of the conversation between
                                    Dr. Wu and the Korean Premier and Foreign Minister had not been
                                    such as to cause the Generalissimo to bring up the subject with
                                    President Rhee.</item>

                                <item>The foregoing account agrees substantially with one given by

                                <item>On September 12, an Embassy officer in a conversation with the
                                    Korean Foreign Minister, raised the question of the
                                    conversations described above, basing his remarks on alleged
                                    rumors coming from the Chinese Mission in Tokyo. The Foreign
                                    Minister heatedly denied that the Koreans would grant bases on
                                    Cheju to the Chinese or anyone else. He said that Korea was too
                                    jealous of her own sovereignty and territory to alienate any of
                                    it for purposes of doubtful advantage to Korea and in any case
                                    the Korean Government was not yet in a position as to know how
                                    to develop Cheju for its own interests and advantage.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>Subsequently, rumors which have yet to be substantiated, have
                                    come to the Embassy’s attention that Koreans and Chinese are
                                    negotiating on the use of Inchon by the Chinese as a naval base
                                    and on the bombing of Antung from Korean bases. These rumors
                                    also suggest that President Rhee has written the Chinese a
                                    letter on these subjects. In the light of these rumors, an
                                    Embassy officer again raised the question of their validity with
                                    the Foreign Minister on September 18, during the course of a
                                    conversation on another subject. The Foreign Minister stated
                                    categorically that he knew of no such conversations since the
                                    Chinhae conference, that such proposals had not been discussed
                                    in cabinet meetings, that he himself believed the assignment of

                                <item>In this general connection, the Korean Minister of Defense, in
                                    the course of an informal conversation with an Embassy officer
                                    on September 16, stated that the Chinese military attaché has
                                    recently approached the Korean Army <gloss target="#t_G21"
                                        >G</gloss>–2 with a proposal that there be an exchange of
                                    information on the subject of communism and that the Chinese be
                                    allowed to establish certain intelligence installations on the
                                    Korean mainland and on certain Korean islands. The Korean
                                    Defense Minister stated that these proposals had been brought to
                                    his and the President’s attention and that they had issued
                                    instructions that conversations with the Chinese military
                                    attaché on this subject be discontinued. The Minister of Defense
                                    indicated that in no event would the Chinese be allowed to
                                    install their own intelligence installations on Korean
                                    soil.</item>

                                <item>On the morning of September 19, following a conversation with
                                    President Rhee on another subject, an Embassy officer told the
                                    President that rumors were prevalent of negotiations with the
                                    Chinese for Korean bases and inquired as to their accuracy. The
                                    President’s first reply was “wait, and you will know from the
                                    results”. The Embassy officer then said, “In that case, I take
                                    it there actually are negotiations in progress with the Chinese
                                    on the subject of bases”. President Rhee thereupon replied to
                                    the effect that the Chinese Embassy was pressing him to grant
                                    both bases and domicile to Chinese personnel (presumably
                                    intelligence personnel although he did not make this clear) and
                                    he felt that relations with China were such that a flat
                                    rejection of their proposals would be inappropriate. He went on
                                    to say, however, that he did not intend to accede to any of the
                                    Chinese proposals, whether for bases or for stationing of
                                    Chinese personnel in Korea. He further said that the American
                                    Embassy could rest assured that after the discussions were
                                    ended, despite his studied avoidance of a directly negative
                                    reply, the Chinese would be no further advanced in the
                                    attainment of their objectives then they were in the beginning.
                                    He cautioned the Embassy officer that information on his
                                    position was of the most sensitive nature and asked the Embassy
                                    officer not to pass on such information.</item>

                                <item>The Embassy is aware that President Rhee, while sympathizing
                                    with the Chinese National Government in its struggle against
                                    international communism, and desiring to maintain close
                                    relations with the Generalissimo, is at the same time highly
                                    suspicious of Chinese conduct and motives, does not intend to be
                                    dragged into the internecine struggles with the Chinese
                                    communists, and is determined not to alienate Korean bases to
                                    any Power no matter how friendly that Power may be toward Korea.
                                    The President would probably not be adverse to the visit of
                                    Chinese naval vessels to Korean ports, but it is highly unlikely
                                    that he would turn over any of these ports to the Chinese <pb

                                Assembly, made an address before the first plenary meeting on the
                                United States position on problems confronting the 4th General
                                Assembly (text in the Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, October 3, 1949, page 489). Regarding Korea, he
                                made the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… It is the view of the United States that a United Nations
                                        Commission should continue to be stationed in Korea. Among
                                        the principal responsibilities of such a body should be to
                                        observe and report on any developments which might lead to
                                        military conflict in Korea, to use the influence of the
                                        United Nations to avert the potential threat of internal
                                        strife in that troubled land, and to explore further the
                                        possibility of unification. The authority of the Commission
                                        to observe and report on the actual facts may be sufficient
                                        to prevent open hostilities. This is the fervent desire of
                                        all patriotic Koreans. …”</p>

                                of August twentieth on the subject of immediate requirements of the
                                military forces of the Republic of Korea, I have taken occasion to
                                review the nature of and the considerations affecting the military
                                assistance provided to Korea by the United States Government.</p>
                            <p>As you know, in order to aid the Republic of Korea in maintaining
                                internal security and to assist in building Korean military forces
                                which will serve effectively to deter external aggression, this
                                Government already has provided a considerable amount of military
                                equipment, valued at approximately $56,000,000, and has established
                                a United States Military Advisory Group in Korea. Also, there is
                                under consideration at present a world-wide program which, if
                                approved by the Congress, will include provisions for additional
                                military assistance to the Republic of Korea.<note n="2"

                                participating in the Military Assistance Program. It is felt that
                                the additional assistance which would become available upon approval
                                of the program now before the Congress would be adequate to provide
                                for the maintenance of the equipment already at hand in Korea plus a
                                limited amount of replacement items.</p>

                                Brigadier General W. L. Roberts has been established in Korea which,
                                among its other duties, is responsible to the Ambassador in

                            <p>The Ambassador has, from time to time, reported to the Department on
                                the subject of communist guerrilla activities in the territory under
                                control of the Republic of Korea. The Ambassador has reported, for
                                example, the successful operations carried out by the Korean Army in
                                the early part of this year on Cheju island and in the Chiri
                                mountain area of South Cholla and South Kyongsang provinces. The
                                Ambassador is glad to be able to report that the Cheju operation was
                                so devastatingly successful that the communist raiders have been
                                unable to make a come back of any kind on that most strategically
                                important island. With regard to the Chiri mountain area, however,
                                the communist guerrillas have been able to survive to a certain
                                extent. They have also been increasingly active during the past
                                three months in the more rugged mountain areas of North Kyongsang
                                and Kangwon provinces. <pb n="1087" xml:id="pg_1087" facs="0501"
                                />The persistence of these guerrilla operations is, of course, a
                                tribute to the untiring efforts of the North Korea communists,
                                spurred by their Soviet masters to create terror and chaos in the
                                south, the ultimate objective of which is unmistakably to insure
                                Soviet control of the South Korea peninsula and thus wipe out non
                                Soviet influence from the Asian mainland extending from the Arctic
                                Circle to French Indochina. It is clear that the North Korea
                                communists have been engaged in what might be termed an “all out”
                                guerrilla offensive during the summer months when nature’s cover was
                                such as to facilitate their operations. Those operations have been
                                accomplished in the main by the sending of many hundreds of trained
                                guerrillas and saboteurs, a good portion of whom possess arms, to
                                areas south of the Thirty-Eighth Parallel.</p>
                            <p>Considering their numbers, their evidently well prepared plans and
                                the fanatical nature of their mission, the guerrillas have not had
                                any large measure of success. It is true that they have been able to
                                marshal several hundred men for attacks on towns and villages on
                                several occasions. But in most cases these attacks have been beaten
                                off and ultimately the guerrillas have been subjected to heavy
                                losses. In the past three months, it would appear that the
                                guerrillas have lost well over a thousand men in engagements with
                                the Korean Army and Police. In this connection, the activities of
                                the Army, in particular, are being stepped up and it is thought that
                                even heavier casualties will be inflicted upon the communist bandits
                                in the course of the next two or three months.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps the main result of communist guerrilla depredation in the
                                territory of the Republic has been the creation of a feeling of
                                uneasiness and in some areas of terror. Materially the communists
                                have been unable to carry out sabotage of any real importance.
                                Neither have the guerrillas been able to establish anything but
                                transitory bases. There is no indication that they have been able to
                                gain the loyalty of the local inhabitants who fear and detest
                                them.</p>

                                increasing daily. It is apparent that a weak coast guard not only

                            <p>On October 24 President Rhee told an Embassy officer that he intended

                            <p>President Rhee said that this request for <gloss target="#t_CNAC1"
                                    >CNAC</gloss> landing rights was tied up with various requests
                                made by Chinese representatives for sea and air bases. In connection
                                with these requests, the Chinese had offered military equipment,
                                especially planes, saying they would transfer equipment received or
                                coming from the United States. The Korean Government, not wishing to
                                get involved in the Chinese civil war, did not wish to give the
                                Chinese any base of operations in Korea, but the Korean Government
                                was most anxious to get more arms, especially planes. The Koreans,
                                therefore, had urged the Chinese to make arms available for which
                                the Korean Government would pay in red ginseng which was considered
                                a valuable commodity in China. To this, the Chinese had made no
                                response, but instead urged the granting of landing rights to <gloss

                            <p>Coupled with the <gloss target="#t_CNAC1">CNAC</gloss> proposal, as
                                presented in the next to last paragraph of the Chinese Embassy’s
                                note, was the statement that <gloss target="#t_CNAC1">CNAC</gloss>
                                was authorized to negotiate for giving of assistance to the Korean
                                Government. This was a reference to continued negotiations on an
                                exchange of arms for bases, and probably the basing of Chinese
                                military planes in Korea.</p>

                                Ambassador was pressing for a reply. President Rhee supplied the

                                        were extemporaneous. It understood their gist reported by US
                                        press services whose correspondents were present. Briefly,
                                        Rhee welcomed the Navy, expressed appreciation for US
                                        economic and military aid, declared US stood for democratic
                                        principles and had no imperialistic designs despite what
                                        Communists might say to contrary, asserted Soviet Union
                                        predatory and imperialistic power now occupying northern
                                        half Korea and entertaining designs on remainder Korea,
                                        declared Republic of Korea would fight to end against Soviet
                                        aggression alone, if necessary, but preferably with US and
                                        UN aid. Rhee termed Korea today ‘a body cut in half’ and
                                        went on to declare ‘we can’t live much longer this way.’
                                        Rhee appeared to intimate force might be only way whereby
                                        Korean unity might be achieved.</p>
                                    <p>“Rhee has made similar statements on several occasions at his
                                        press conferences, but hardly in such forceful manner.</p>

                                Embassy officer pointed out substance Rhee’s remarks on <hi
                                    rend="italic">St. Paul</hi> had been published all over world.
                                Rhee appeared surprised and indicated some concern. In conversation
                                with me November 3 he expressed regret his remarks had aroused so
                                much interest. He wished me to know his thinking had not changed. He
                                explained that in talk he wished convey idea he had no plan to move
                                north today or tomorrow but that Republic of Korea would have to be
                                prepared to fight and unify country by force if necessary. Present
                                intolerable division, he explained, could not go on
                                indefinitely.</p>
                            <p>At his conference with Korean correspondents this morning Rhee was
                                queried about his remarks on <hi rend="italic">St. Paul</hi>. He
                                replied as follows (in translation): “At that time, I was not
                                prepared to make a speech <pb n="1094" xml:id="pg_1094" facs="0508"
                                />before the Navy men. I gave them this opinion of mine
                                accidentally. It seems that what I said at that time has been
                                reported throughout the world. But this speech of mine does not mean
                                any change of policy taken to date. We have reserved our opinion.
                                Everybody should know that when this situation proves critical for
                                us, we should take some decisive countermeasures. However, this does
                                not mean an immediate attack on the north”.</p>

                                must be taken to enable Republic of Korea to put up effective
                                defense against expanding North Korean air power. Unless such
                                program is taken in hand at early date Korean security will be
                                jeopardized and we will consequently risk loss our objectives in
                                Korea. I strongly hope, therefore, Department will exert every
                                effort to see that very modest air program recommended by General
                                Roberts is carried out. Incidentally President Rhee and other
                                responsible Korean officials are likewise showing deep concern over
                                persistent reports of Soviet strengthening of North Korean Air Force
                                and continued failure of US to lend support to commensurate building
                                up of Republic of Korean Air Force. In consequence, as Department
                                aware, Rhee has taken steps to purchase ten AT–6 aircraft, is
                                interested in purchase of other aircraft, and is presently
                                considering employment General Russell Randall<note n="2"

                                experience with Harold Lady as Rhee’s advisor in economic field, I
                                am loath to face possibility of similar setup in political field. I
                                am confident a small amount of air aid encouragement on our part
                                would forestall employment of private advisors and dissipation,
                                through purchase of aircraft, of meagre Korean foreign exchange

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my
                                despatch no. 569, dated September 16, 1949, with which I transmitted
                                the recommendations of the Chief, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss>, for additional military assistance to the
                                Republic of Korea for the fiscal year 1950, pursuant to the terms of
                                the Department of Army’s telegram Warx–92292. I stressed, in my
                                despatch, the fact that the recommendations of the Chief, <gloss
                                    target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>, had been prepared within the
                                framework of an expenditure of $10 million, exclusive of
                                transportation charges, and I pointed out that in certain
                                contingencies this sum would be inadequate to insure the military
                                security of the Republic of Korea.</p>
                            <p>I therefore requested the Chief, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss>, to institute a careful overall survey of the
                                general security situation, having particularly in mind persistent
                                reports of the recent strengthening by the Soviets of the North
                                Korean security forces. The Chief, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss>, has now submitted his supplementary
                                recommendations, copies of which are attached.<note n="1"

                                Korean army of 65,000 (we have thus far so equipped an army of
                                50,000 except for the supply of an additional 15,000 M–1 rifles) but
                                to take early steps to strengthen certain weaknesses which are
                                evident in the Korean security forces. As brought out in the Chief,
                                    <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>’s recommendations, the
                                Korean security forces urgently require strengthening in the
                                following categories: (1) more and heavier artillery, (2) limited
                                aid to the Korean Air Force, and (3) further strengthening of the
                                Korean Coast Guard (Navy).</p>
                            <p>In my opinion, implementation of the Chief, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                    >KMAG</gloss>’s recommendations—preferably at the earliest
                                possible date—would enormously strengthen the security of the
                                Republic of Korea and would serve to remove the constantly growing
                                threat implicit in the steady increase by the Soviets of the
                                military power of their North Korean puppets.</p>
                            <p>It is to be remarked that the cost estimates used by the Chief,
                                    <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>, in connection with his
                                recommendations are based on new United States’ procurement costs.
                                It will be obvious that if the recommended aircraft and coast guard
                                vessels could be obtained as surplus at low prices, the cost figures
                                would be greatly diminished. It is my <pb n="1096" xml:id="pg_1096"
                                    facs="0510"/>earnest hope that the recommended equipment can be
                                so obtained for the Korean security forces.</p>
                            <p>I wish to point out that the basic requirements of the Korean
                                security forces, set forth in the enclosure to my despatch no. 569
                                of September 16, 1949, should continue to have first priority. In
                                this connection, it would appear that the funds to be allocated to
                                the Republic of Korea under the Military Assistance Program will be
                                largely if not wholly exhausted in filling those priority needs. If
                                so, it is hoped that funds will be found in some other quarter to
                                meet the supplementary needs of the Korean security forces here
                                discussed. In this relation, it is respectfully suggested that
                                consideration be given to utilization of a portion of the $75
                                million appropriated for use “in China and the general area” for the
                                further strengthening of the Korean security forces.<note n="3"

                                related the immediate question of the counterpart rate to the
                                overall financial position of the Republic of Korea, which has been
                                deteriorating in recent months under the impact of increasing
                                deficit spending by the Government.</p>
                            <p>Enclosure No. 2<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">Not printed.</note> is a
                                summary comparison of major economic indicators in the Republic of
                                Korea, which was compiled by the Program Review Staff of the
                                American Mission, to be used as a basis for discussion with the
                                Korean Government officials. This comparison of major economic
                                indicators, including prices of major commodities, wages and
                                salaries, charges for utilities and government services, currency in
                                circulation, and public and private finance, is designed to point up
                                some of the basic problems which must be resolved in the immediate
                                future so that the goals of economic recovery and stability can be
                                achieved.</p>
                            <p>Enclosure No. 3<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn4">Not printed.</note> is a
                                recent tabulation of won pricing of aid supplies imported into
                                Korea, which was also distributed to Korean officials participating
                                in the Government–<gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> conferences.
                                This tabulation indicates that, on the basis of current Office of
                                Supply won pricing of 15 major commodities imported into Korea with
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> funds, the average won rate
                                charged (in relation to the current landed dollar cost) equal won
                                553.27 per U.S. dollar.</p>
                            <p>The Korean Government officials, including two leaders in the
                                National Assembly, initially took the position that any official
                                changes in the counterpart rate from won 450 to $1.00 should be
                                deferred, at least until July 1, 1950. Their position was based upon
                                the contention that such increases at this time would be
                                inflationary, and should be postponed until production increased
                                further.</p>
                            <p>The Chief of the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> Mission, in
                                turn, made it very clear to the Korean officials that the American
                                Mission considered the continued heavy deficit spending by the
                                Government to be the most important inflationary factor, and that
                                the Korean economic recovery program is being placed in jeopardy by
                                the present unsound financial practices of the Government. Dr. Bunce
                                presented the Korean Government with a proposed eight point program,
                                designed to achieve greater financial stability, as follows.</p>

                            <p>These recent conferences appear to have impressed President Rhee and
                                his Ministers with the apprehension and urgency with which the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> Mission views present
                                financial trends in Korea, and the Government is now giving top
                                priority to consideration of these problems. In his press conference
                                with Korean reporters on November 11, President Rhee indicated that
                                the price of goods distributed by the Government should be gradually
                                increased until they are in line with market prices.</p>
                            <p>At the conclusion of a conference with <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> Mission officials on November 11, Prime Minister
                                Lee, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Korea
                                agreed that the Counterpart Rate for imported aid supplies should be
                                gradually increased, to reflect actual prices charged by the Office
                                of Supply. Under this plan the Korean Government will institute
                                selective increases in the won prices of aid supplies, raising the
                                rate at which deposits are made into the Counterpart Fund to
                                correspond to the average dollar–won rate of resale prices of the
                                Office of Supply. Under this procedure, it is hoped the Counterpart
                                Rate for November 1949 can be set at won 500 to $1.00, and for
                                December 1949, at won 600 to $1.00.</p>
                            <p>Because the actual collections of won from end-users for <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> imports are actually more important
                                in combatting inflation than the nominal counterpart deposits made
                                into the Counterpart Fund, every effort is being made to step up
                                counterpart collections. Enclosure No. 4<note n="4" xml:id="d294fn6"
                                    >Not printed.</note> is a letter sent from the Deputy for

                                            two documents requesting further military aid from the
                                            United States in the form of specific items for the
                                            Korean Army and Navy. Ambassador Muccio indicated that
                                            both he and General Roberts had been unaware that the
                                            Korean officials intended to present these requests. In

                                seriously crippling because expenditure such spare parts by <gloss

                                replacement. Reduction by 50 percent of all types priority two items
                                probably most damaging and dangerous cut. In view large number of
                                troops training with each individual and crew-served weapon, it is
                                imperative that ammunition be supplied at greater than US rate of
                                supply per weapon. For example, in view of shortage of calibre 30
                                machine guns for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army of 100,000

                                spare parts mentioned above, many more crews train on each weapon
                                than in US Army. Thus lack spare parts and ammunition snowballs into
                                an intolerable shortage. All of this is of course entirely aside
                                from real danger to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of having

                                                Briefly Randall’s recommendations (based on US aid)
                                                envisage 99–plane air force made up of 8 L–4’s, 21

                                                14 L–type planes and 10 AT–6’s under procurement, 75
                                                planes would have to be acquired. Under Randall’s
                                                plan, of these planes 9 would be acquired by April
                                                1950, another 33 by July, another 14 by October, and

                                        of view risks involved are not inacceptable. While Soviets
                                        are gradually increasing North Korean military power, we are
                                        by no means convinced Soviets willing take risk of
                                        unleashing all-out war, ramifications and course of which
                                        are highly unpredictable. In our view Soviets will instead
                                        continue present tactics of subversion and sabotage in hope
                                        of building up indigenous guerrilla movement in south.

                                        fields of agriculture and industrial production. Under no
                                        circumstance should MDAP for Korea be abandoned. Such a step
                                        would constitute utter reversal of a consistent policy
                                        toward <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, would subject us
                                        criticism and ridicule in UN and elsewhere, and would
                                        utterly destroy faith and confidence of Koreans and
                                        virtually all other Far Eastern peoples in professed

                                        Far Eastern areas. Further justification for acceptance of

                            <p>Brigadier General Russell E. Randall, U.S. Air Force, Retired, who
                                returned on November 26 after a brief visit to Korea at the
                                invitation of President Rhee, called at his request and touched upon
                                the following points:</p>
                            <p>1. During his recent visit here, General Chennault<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d299fn1">Claire Lee Chennault, President of Civil Air
                                    Transport.</note> asked General Randall if he would be
                                interested in becoming an “air advisor for the Korean Government”.
                                General Chennault had been offered this position, but because of the
                                pressure of his present interests in China, he did not feel he could
                                assume such a position and had recommended General Randall as his
                                alternate. General Randall stated that he had made the trip to Korea
                                without undertaking a commitment beyond rendering “advice” to
                                President Rhee upon the immediate problem of establishing a Korean
                                Air Force. He indicated that his future interest would depend upon
                                developments in this connection that might be approved and financed
                                by the United States, or adopted by the Korean Government with the
                                sanction of the United States. In any case, he intended to maintain
                                his first loyalty to the United States.</p>
                            <pb n="1105" xml:id="pg_1105" facs="0519"/>
                            <p>2. In response to Mr. Butterworth’s question, General Randall
                                indicated that although General Chennault may not feel it to his
                                advantage to accept a position with the Korean Government at this
                                time, his interest in Korea doubtless lay in the location of that
                                country as a possible refuge and base of operations should his
                                airline and other interests in China deteriorate.</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>4. General Randall reviewed the recommendations he has made relating
                                to the establishment of a Korean Air Force. These have been the
                                subject of recent telegrams from the Embassy at Seoul.</p>
                            <p>5. Following the discussion with Mr. Butterworth, General Randall
                                indicated to Mr. Williams that during the course of the conversation
                                he was afraid he had not stressed sufficiently President Rhee’s
                                reiterated statements to General Randall asserting that the
                                Government of the Republic of Korea would not embark upon offensive
                                action in north Korea without the approval of the United States
                                Government.</p>

                                    <p>President Knee’s letter, not printed, read in part:</p>
                                    <p>“… In presenting this request for the consideration of the
                                        United States Government, I wish to reiterate that the
                                        Korean Government has neither the ambition nor the intention
                                        to develop or to use an air force for aggressive purposes.
                                        Our sole concern is the security and defense of the Republic
                                        against unprovoked attack.…”</p>
                                </note> Details of the request are set forth in an attached
                                    memorandum<note n="3" xml:id="d300fn3">Not printed.</note>
                                which, as the Department is aware, was prepared by Brig. Gen.
                                Russell E. Randall, U.S. Air Force, who came to Korea at the request
                                of President Rhee to discuss with him the question of the Korean Air
                                Force. President Rhee’s request for air assistance differs from the
                                recommendations presented by Gen. Randall apparently only to the
                                extent that President Rhee substituted three C–47s or C–46s for the
                                three C–39s recommended by Gen. Randall for <pb n="1106"
                                    xml:id="pg_1106" facs="0520"/>acquisition and asked for 24
                                anti-aircraft guns for the defense of Seoul and Inchon.</p>
                            <p>Reasons are set forth in the enclosure to the President’s letter for
                                the strengthening of the Korean Air Force, and with these I agree.
                                As indicated in my telegram no. 1473, December 7, I feel that the
                                President’s request is a modest one, except that I cannot see the
                                need at this time for the six long-range reconnaissance aircraft
                                (B–25s). Also, I believe that the Korean Air Force could get along
                                adequately with three C–47 or C–46 transport aircraft rather than
                                the nine requested by President Rhee. My views in this respect are
                                shared by the Chief, <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss>, and the

                            <p>Should the United States Government find it desirable and possible to
                                supply the aircraft recommended, the question of the cost and the
                                source of the funds therefor will, of course, arise. It is my hope
                                that some way will be found to provide the aircraft outside the
                                scope of the 10.23 million dollars allocated to Korea under the MDAP
                                program, for all that sum will be needed for the urgent requirements
                                of the Korean Army. If the United States Government is willing only
                                to supply the aircraft out of the MDAP allotment to Korea and at
                                present replacement costs, then I am inclined to recommend that the
                                Republic of Korea consider the purchase of such aircraft from
                                dealers out of its own foreign exchange resources, provided the
                                aircraft are available at reasonable prices.</p>
                            <p>I should be glad to have the Department’s comment regarding ways and
                                means by which suitable aircraft could be obtained by the Republic
                                of Korea at the lowest possible cost.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Embassy’s Despatch No. 553,
                                September 7, 1949,<note n="1" xml:id="d302fn1">Not printed.</note>
                                and transmits herewith the Department’s views as to the desirability
                                of encouraging the Government of the Republic of Korea to appeal to
                                the General Assembly (or to the Security Council) if there should be
                                a major military attack across the thirty-eighth parallel.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State requests that the Embassy report to the
                                Department all particulars regarding any such military attack and
                                the extent to which the Government of the Republic of Korea is in
                                agreement with the course which the United Nations Commission
                                proposes to follow. At that time the Secretary of State will
                                transmit to the Embassy the views of the Department on any possible
                                United Nations action in light of the particular conditions and
                                circumstances contained in the report.</p>
                            <p>The resolution adopted by the General Assembly on October 21, 1949
                                reflects the fact that the Assembly has anticipated the
                                possibilities of major military conflict in Korea and that it is
                                taking steps to secure promptly from its own subsidiary organ
                                particulars regarding any attack which may occur. Standard
                                procedures are available whereby a Special Session might be called
                                to consider this information if in the opinion of a majority of
                                United Nations Member States such a session were to appear
                                necessary.</p>
                            <p>As the findings of the Commission are likely to weigh heavily in the
                                determination of any further United Nations action, the Government
                                of the Republic of Korea might wish to bring its own course as
                                closely as possible into harmony with the general tenor of
                                Commission findings regarding a major attack.</p>

                                items transcend in importance common use items set forth <gloss
                                    target="#t_reftel1">reftel</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>It is impossible to estimate specifically what diversion <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might make from civilian economy if
                                common use items not financed by <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                                or MDAP. However, based on recent experience and observations, it

                                public security. In event major crisis such as major attack from

                                diversions which would seriously impair <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> recovery program. Serious deterioration of Korean

                                interested agencies attention is invited following considerations
                                (1) MDAP program for Korea, as presently constituted, is wholly
                                inadequate and allows <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Security
                                Forces barest minimum of ammunition, some ordnance spares, small
                                quantity signal equipment, etc. It allows virtually no replacements
                                and fails to take care of pressing air force and coast guard
                                requirements. (2) Security force replenishment and replacement need
                                here are relatively greater than in virtually any other MDAP area
                                because of conditions existing here: armed forces facing each other
                                along entire stretch of thirty-eighth parallel with sporadic clashes
                                and daily battles with guerrillas in hinterland. (3) <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> must appreciate its program here
                                dependent on maintenance peace and order. The more <gloss

                                items, the more MDAP funds can be utilized for urgently needed
                                military items and consequently progress of <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                    >ECA</gloss> program better insured. In view foregoing

                            <p>A Land Redistribution Law applying to large Korean landholdings (some
                                1,800,000 acres) was passed by the National Assembly on <pb n="1111"
                                    xml:id="pg_1111" facs="0525"/>April 27, 1949. This law aims to
                                convert over two million farm families into owner-operators and
                                reduces the amount of land under tenant farming in Korea to less
                                than 10 per cent of the total cultivated land, as contrasted with 73
                                per cent in 1945 and 40 per cent at present. Under this law, the
                                Government is to purchase lands from landlords against the
                                equivalent in cash of 150 per cent of one year’s production and
                                transfer ownership to the tenant by collecting a total of 125 per
                                cent of one year’s crop at an annual rate of 25 per cent of each
                                year’s production of the principal crop over a period of five
                                years.</p>
                            <p>In June, 1949, President Rhee vetoed the Land Redistribution Law and
                                on June 21, 1949, the National Assembly overrode his veto and the
                                law was promulgated by President Rhee on June 22,<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d304fn2">An English text of the law is printed in U.N.
                                    document A/1881, p. 49.</note> although opposition within the
                                Korean Government has caused a delay in setting up the necessary
                                machinery to implement this law in time for the 1949 rice
                                harvest.</p>
                            <p>Amendments to the Land Redistribution Law submitted by the Assembly
                                Committee on Industry now under discussion in the Korean National
                                Assembly would increase the landlords’ compensation from 150 per
                                cent to 240 per cent and extend the period of compensation from five
                                to eight years. The expectation that the land reform law will be
                                implemented has exerted a downward pressure on land prices. Tenant
                                farmers in many cases are permitted to purchase their farms at less
                                than half their current market value since landlords are desirous of
                                selling at sacrifice prices. Article 10 of the law authorizes the
                                Government to give landlords “priority for participation in
                                enterprises contributing to the development of the national
                                economy.” The Government plans under this article to give landlords
                                a priority right to purchase formerly Japanese vested residential
                                and industrial properties.</p>
                            <p>The Assembly at its recent session failed to pass the budget for the
                                implementation of the land reform law; however, President Rhee has
                                authorized expenditure of 100 billion won to initiate the
                                program.</p>
                            <p>The American Mission in Korea which includes the <gloss

                                representation to the President of Korea stressing the urgent need
                                for implementing the Land Redistribution Law and plans are now being
                                discussed jointly by State–<gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss> to

                                harvest. However, it is difficult to find a method whereby landlords
                                may be equitably compensated without seriously aggravating the
                                already critical inflationary situation in the country.</p>

                                being threatened by the inflation, the implications thereof being of
                                such a serious nature as to warrant the strongest representations to
                                the President of the Republic. Accordingly, the Officer in Charge is
                                instructed, in close cooperation with the Economic Cooperation
                                Administration’s representative, to present a detailed set of

                                the reversal of the present inflationary trend. In making detailed
                                representations to the President, the Officer in Charge should
                                incorporate the substance of the following as considerations

                                        be reviewed in terms of its feasibility. In this connection,
                                        it should be emphasized that the counterpart fund is
                                        designed, as in other countries receiving economic

                                                measures must be taken to eliminate the system of

                                                immediately unless those subsidies can be financed,

                                    called a conference of the “Asian Organization of States” to
                                    meet at New Delhi in late January to consider, among other
                                    matters, the Indonesian situation. States represented were
                                    Afghanistan, Australia, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, Ethiopia, India,
                                    Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia,
                                    Syria, and Yemen, with China, Nepal, New Zealand, and Siam as
                                    observers. The conference resolved to explore “ways and means of
                                    establishing suitable machinery, having regard to areas
                                    concerned, for the purpose of promoting consultation within the
                                    framework of the United Nations.” On January 23 a resolution on
                                    Indonesia was adopted; for text, see the <hi rend="italic">New
                                        York Times</hi>, January 24, 1949.</note> might tend to
                                become an anti-Western bloc causing a split between East and West.
                                He answered with emphasis, “I will not permit it and Romulo will be
                                so instructed”. He said I am also instructing Romulo that there
                                should be no “yelling” by the Philippine Delegation in the
                                conference—that it should assume a calm attitude letting others
                                “carry the ball”. I told him New Zealand and Ceylon had accepted
                                invitation reluctantly and Turkey and Siam will not attend. He said
                                that is all the more reason why Romulo should conduct his activities
                                in the conference calmly though vigilantly.</p>
                            <p>I mentioned to the President that we hoped the activities and actions
                                of the conference would be kept within the framework of the UN. He
                                replied “that will be my purpose and Romulo will be so instructed”.
                                He said he held some apprehensions that some delegates to the
                                conference might attempt to direct its activities along the “color
                                line” thereby fostering an anti-Western bloc. He stated he thought
                                this would be a mistake and Romulo would be so informed of his ideas
                                on the subject. President Quirino said Moro Senator Pendatun is
                                irked at him (he did not attend dinner) because of his slow approach
                                to the Asian bloc idea. Quirino said the world knows we are for the
                                Indonesians but the formation of an Asian bloc should be approached
                                with caution and its activities wisely directed so as not to put the
                                East against the West.</p>
                            <p>Later saw Romulo. He said although he had not received his final
                                instructions the United States need not feel any uneasiness about
                                the activities of the Philippine Delegation in the conference. He
                                stated he would depart by Saturday January 15 (Manila time) for New
                                Delhi in order to hold preliminary conference with his friend Nehru
                                for purpose of “softening” any ideas which latter may have relative
                                to “color line” activities in conference. Romulo said any general
                                action of conference could not go beyond effective support which
                                Asian bloc could obtain outside its own organization and he said
                                that meant from the United States. Romulo stated he discussed this
                                particular point with Philip Jessup.<note n="5" xml:id="d308fn5"

                            <p>392. March of events in Asia confirms my conviction that Communists
                                cannot be stopped in this vast semi-colonial area by military force
                                or economic aid alone. The effective containment of Soviet
                                expansion-through-Communism requires in Asia new approach with
                                appropriate implementation not so much in terms of money or
                                munitions but in convincingly dramatized ideas. Collapse of Chiang

                                peasants, Communism represents dynamic socialized reform struggling
                                to overthrow corrupt reactionary bureaucracy. US has been in their
                                minds identified with latter.</p>
                            <p>I suggest, therefore, new approach; approach primarily to mind and
                                heart. UK, France, Netherlands should be invited to unite with US in
                                federation to assist restoration complete independence to peoples of
                                eastern and southeastern Asia; to protect them in process from more
                                subtle form of imperialism through high [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >highly</hi>] organized minorities of their own people linked to
                                international Communism.</p>
                            <p>India, Philippines and other countries in area might be included.
                                Concerning Indonesia and Indochina it might be argued they will also
                                sooner or later be engulfed and that it is to interest of democratic
                                solidarity as well as of Netherlands and France that they be
                                liberated graciously rather than grudgingly and as total loss. UK
                                might make unequivocal declarations as to Hong Kong and Malaya when
                                certain specified conditions will permit, until which time a
                                protectorate is to be maintained. Portugal might be asked make
                                similar declaration re Macao.</p>
                            <p>Any such proposals should of course be treated with strictest secrecy
                                until other governments have given their response. If this proves
                                favorable there should be fullest and most alluring publicity.
                                Technological education in realization of noble vision shown in
                                President’s inaugural address, together with economic and military
                                aid wisely planned, would supplement political action. But lesson of
                                China, as I interpret it, is that inspiring, high-principled,
                                generously conceived, forward-looking policies will be infinitely
                                more effective in Asia now and cost far less than any of the
                                traditional methods. As to China itself reaction would undoubtedly
                                be favorable to US. It might put Communists <pb n="1118"

                                their methods. It might help to arouse revolt against them under new
                                leadership and with popular support. It might lead to form of
                                temporary protectorate over certain provinces or areas similar to
                                pattern elsewhere. Communists are still long way from conquering all
                                China and such program would in any case make their aim much less

                                effects of the Communist successes there and the repercussions those
                                successes will have on Southeast Asia, and the means of containing
                                the Communist menace. He said that he had a further explanation of
                                the British views as to these matters, but particularly as to the
                                means to be employed to contain the Communist menace. This
                                explanation was given in a more or less personal communication to
                                him from Mr. Dening of the Foreign Office. The latter admitted that
                                any concerted move on the part of the UK and the US to build up a
                                front against Communism would result in whetting the appetites of
                                the countries in the Far East for increased assistance from the UK
                                and especially from the US. Accordingly, in the British approach to
                                countries of or those interested in the Far East the British had
                                been careful not to give the appearance of committing the US in any
                                way and had taken pains to point out that they could not comment
                                upon the US policy as regards the subject matter of the memoranda as
                                this had not been communicated to them. Mr. Dening continued that
                                the British ideas did not envisage an anti-Communist movement in
                                terms of US dollars but rather US cooperation in terms of moral
                                support of the British thesis that the Asiatic countries must set
                                their houses in order and must evolve a policy of their own in the
                                struggle against Communism. In other words, the concerted US–UK
                                effort <pb n="1119" xml:id="pg_1119" facs="0533"/>suggested by the
                                Foreign Office memoranda was destined merely to fill the gaps and
                                the greatest emphasis was to be put on self-help.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Graves then asked if we would reply to the Foreign Office
                                memoranda and give our suggestions as how best to implement the
                                proposals therein. I replied that I thought that the British should
                                first come forth with concrete suggestions so that we could start
                                with those as a basis of discussion, particularly as our policy
                                vis-à-vis Korea, Japan, the Philippines, China, Indochina, Siam,
                                Malaya and Indonesia, had been made sufficiently clear. After I had
                                rehearsed briefly the major points of our policy in those countries,
                                Mr. Graves in turn touched lightly upon British policy in the
                                mentioned countries, adding Burma to the list. From this exchange of
                                views it appeared that so far as the memoranda were concerned we
                                could agree that our concern was with the mainland and with the flow
                                of Communism southward through Indochina, Siam and Malaya, with a
                                corresponding impact on Burma.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Graves reiterated that his government would like to have a reply
                                to the memoranda even though, as he had mentioned, our answer would
                                be merely associating ourselves with the general principles of the
                                British memoranda.</p>
                            <p>[Following Mr. Butterworth’s departure Mr. Graves continued the
                                discussion of what might be suggested to implement the proposals
                                with Mr. Reed and Mr. Sprouse, in the course of which the thought
                                was expressed that Indochina could, if the solution of that
                                country’s problem could be found, be a bastion in the path of a
                                southward-rolling Communist tide. In this connection it was
                                proffered that if Indochina went completely Communist Siam would
                                probably not long resist the Communist pressure in view of Siam’s
                                traditional history of opportunism and going with the nearest strong
                                political force. At this juncture it was suggested as a point of
                                consideration that there might be high-level talks between the
                                British, the French, and the United States regarding how best to
                                solve the Indochina problem.]<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">Brackets

                                consultation with the British and Australian Ambassadors and myself.
                                In its present form it represents a tentative consensus of opinion

                                it deals with a subject outside of our authority, but the
                                interrelation between China and the area under discussion is

                                Southeast Asia will have favorable reactions for us in China. It is
                                also worth remembering that, except for Burma, the principal
                                Communist agents in that whole region are Chinese.</p>

                                        rend="italic">pace</hi> of events in the adjacent regions,
                                    reducing to the minimum the margin of time available for a
                                    peaceful transformation of the economy of these countries. The
                                    problem arising from the juxtaposition of a Communist controlled
                                    China with the semi-colonial economy of the Southeast Asian
                                    countries may be stated as follows.</p>
                                <p>2. Till now the dominant issue in all the countries of Southeast
                                    Asia was the recovery of freedom. This was essentially a
                                    political issue and with the independence of India and Burma,
                                    the principle may well be said to have been established, though
                                    the last chapter in this phase of history still remains to be
                                    written in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China and
                                    Indonesia. But it is accepted even by the Dutch and the French
                                    that their colonies will soon have to gain independence.</p>
                                <p>3. The achievement of independence does not however solve the
                                    problem which these countries have to face, which is one of
                                    transforming the typically “oriental” civilizations of these
                                    areas held together by anachronistic social bonds and based on a
                                    starvation economy into modern communities, organized on
                                    principles of social justice and economic freedom. In short,
                                    these countries have to <hi rend="italic">compress into a short
                                        period of time</hi>, the whole process of a century of
                                    European evolution, adopt the technology of mid-twentieth
                                    century to societies which are still living in the
                                    pre-industrial revolution era but with new <pb n="1121"
                                        xml:id="pg_1121" facs="0535"/>and destructive ideas sweeping
                                    their minds. The resulting condition is essentially
                                    revolutionary, both in its process and in its consequences, for
                                    it is seeking to force developments and not allowing the slow
                                    process of evolution to work.</p>
                                <p>4. If it is accepted that the situation is revolutionary in its
                                    content, then the question immediately follows as to how it can
                                    be brought under control and guided into proper channels, for if
                                    we do not bring it under control, the Communists with their easy
                                    solution of “Land to the Tiller” and “Power to the Worker” will
                                    step in and take charge.</p>
                                <p>5. In the circumstances of Southeast Asia, the Communist solution
                                    has an immense appeal. The situation has been foreseen by the
                                    Communist thinkers who recognize that the transition from
                                    feudalism to communism is in a way easier, as the resistance
                                    offered will be by classes which have ceased to be socially
                                    useful and represent no productive principles in society—the
                                    landlords and those who depend on them. In other words the
                                    anti-communist element furnished elsewhere in the world by the
                                    middle class is completely lacking. That is one of the reasons
                                    why Communism is more aggressive in Asia and seems to be less
                                    actively resisted by the masses.</p>
                                <p>6. Any idea that the Southeast Asian countries could be persuaded
                                    to resist the inroads of Communism by arming its opponents and
                                    encouraging the reactionary elements to band together in defense
                                    of “the four freedoms” or the new slogan of free competition is
                                    foredoomed to failure for the simple reason that an economic and
                                    social revolution is already in being throughout the whole
                                    area.</p>
                                <p>7. How then are we to act? Clearly by accepting the revolutionary
                                    content of the situation and providing a solution to the major
                                    issues which the revolution is seeking to solve. If the same
                                    objectives can be gained with greater safety in a reasonably
                                    short time, through a non-Communist solution, then there is
                                    every reason to think that Communism can be resisted in this
                                    area.</p>
                                <p>8. It might of course be argued that the alternative to the
                                    Communist revolution is really what is being done in India—the
                                    attainment of the same objectives by parliamentary methods—that
                                    is a revolution controlled by parliament and effectuated through
                                    legislation. But the circumstances of Southeast Asia do not seem
                                    to warrant any hope of successful action along these lines,
                                    primarily because there is no established principle of obedience
                                    in these countries and secondly because leadership requires an
                                    effectuating machinery—a highly trained efficient and loyal
                                    service—which notoriously does not exist in these countries.</p>
                                <p>9. What then is the alternative? The ultimate solution seems
                                    clear: a confederation of Southeast Asia with a planned and
                                    integrated economy, creating out of the small units in this
                                    region a viable State following a progressive economic and
                                    social policy. In the immediate <pb n="1122" xml:id="pg_1122"
                                        facs="0536"/>future such a solution would perhaps be
                                    impracticable, if only for the reason that the States which are
                                    struggling to acquire their independence like <gloss
                                        target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China, and the States which
                                    have only recently acquired independence like Burma, will not
                                    even consider anything which may limit their political
                                    independence. But the situation created by the existence of a
                                    Communist colossus in the North may possibly prove sufficiently
                                    dynamic to bring about a change in their attitude very much in
                                    the same manner as the Western European States which are so
                                    intensely nationalist have come together in similar
                                    circumstances.</p>
                                <p>10. While this should be the objective, towards which our
                                    activities should be directed, it is obvious that since this
                                    solution is not capable of immediate realization, we should have
                                    a short-term policy which could be put into effect with the
                                    least possible delay. A permanent Consultative Council of the
                                    States of this area which will work out common policies and
                                    provide for an integrated economy capable of resisting the
                                    pressure of Communist economic doctrines would seem to be the
                                    answer. But in order to bring into existence such a Consultative
                                    Council, it is necessary as a first step that <gloss
                                        target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China and Indonesia should
                                    acquire their political freedom and Malaya should have a
                                    constitutional set-up which will enable her at least to
                                    participate in economic policies.</p>
                                <p>11. Such a Consultative Council when brought into being should
                                    have before it an economic and social programme which
                                    realistically deals with the special problems of their backward
                                    societies. Such a programme will have to provide (a) for the
                                    liquidation of unproductive systems of landowning and for a
                                    reorganization of agriculture with aid of the most modern
                                    technology for the purpose of increasing production (b) for the
                                    absorption into industries of large masses of people now living
                                    on land without contributing to the increase of national <hi

                                    economy of the region so as to avoid wasteful inter-regional <hi
                                        rend="italic">competition</hi> (d) for large-scale medical
                                    and sanitary facilities which will eliminate the enervating
                                    effects of the climatic conditions of the ‘monsoon belt’, and
                                    (e) for a common system of education which will provide a
                                    background for democratic development: in short a programme of
                                    planned economy.</p>
                                <p>12. The first step, which should be taken <hi rend="italic"
                                        >now</hi>, is to utilize to the best advantage the time
                                    available before a settlement is arrived at in Indonesia and
                                        <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China and work out a
                                    programme for this region. This can only be done after a careful
                                    analysis of the prevailing social and economic conditions. Such
                                    a survey should cover not merely the present morphology of these
                                    societies, but should be primarily directed towards the shape
                                    they should assume in the future, that is, <hi rend="italic">it
                                        must formulate the principles on which the New Society in

                                <pb n="1123" xml:id="pg_1123" facs="0537"/>
                                <p>13. An enquiry of this nature conducted by a group of what are
                                    called in America “social engineers” would provide us with an
                                    alternative programme which may blunt the appeal of Communism
                                    and tame and regulate the revolutionary process in Southeast
                                    Asia.</p>
                                <p>14. The powers most immediately and directly interested in doing
                                    so are U.S.A., U.K., Australia and India and if the enquiry is
                                    entrusted to a small Committee of four or five high level
                                    political and economic thinkers from these countries, who have
                                    some experience of practical problems, men of the calibre of
                                    Lord Hailey who did the African Survey, then a workable and
                                    forward looking programme would be available for approval by the
                                    Governments concerned.</p>
                                <p>15. It seems likely however, that the Governments of Southeast
                                    Asia, even when working through their own permanent consultative
                                    Council would not be able to take full advantage of the
                                    programme without material assistance and technical advice. It
                                    might therefore be advisable to form some kind of advisory
                                    committee parallel to the permanent consultative Council and
                                    working in close collaboration with it, composed not only of the
                                    four Powers mentioned above but also of France and the
                                    Netherlands whose continuing economic interest in Southeast Asia
                                    must be considerable. This Committee would be responsible for
                                    determining, when invited to do so by the permanent consultative
                                    Council and in concert with that body, the amount and the kind
                                    of assistance required and its procurement.<note n="2"

                            <p>Following the original press publicity given to the negotiations
                                surrounding the proposed North Atlantic Treaty, the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Manila Bulletin</hi> published an editorial on
                                February 28 suggesting the formation of <pb n="1124"
                                    xml:id="pg_1124" facs="0538"/>a Pacific Pact to prevent
                                aggression in the Pacific. The <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>
                                editorial apparently was, in part, inspired by an article published
                                in the same paper on the same day by Vicente Villamin, entitled
                                “Pacific Security Pact.” In its editorial, the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, after examining the purposes of the North
                                Atlantic Treaty, went on to discuss its applicability to the Pacific
                                area. It posed the question “If a group of nations bordering on the
                                North Atlantic believe it necessary to band together for mutual
                                protection, why not the Pacific also?” The <hi rend="italic">Manila
                                    Times</hi> followed up the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>
                                editorial with one of its own on March 2 entitled “Me Too”. The <hi
                                    rend="italic">Times</hi> characterized the proposal for a
                                Pacific pact as something growing out of “the me too school of
                                political reasoning …” It ridiculed the idea as “plain hot air”
                                saying that the “implementation of such a proposed act is a physical
                                impossibility, logistically, financially and politically…”</p>
                            <p>These editorials apparently stirred only moderate discussion of the
                                idea. On March 20, however, President Quirino gave fresh impetus to
                                the idea through the medium of an exclusive interview with Ralph
                                Teatsorth, local chief of the United Press Bureau. Mr. Teatsorth had
                                apparently gone to the President seeking his comment on the North
                                Atlantic Treaty. The President took advantage of the occasion to
                                urge the United States not to neglect the needs of Asia. Speaking of
                                Europe, the President said “Europe is used up—an economic
                                liability.” Asia, however, said the President, “is a virgin region
                                with unmeasured resources and people who are eager to take advantage
                                of the blessings offered by democracy.” He appealed to America to
                                “take the lead in the Far East and not concentrate her entire
                                attention on Europe.” Asked specifically about a Pacific Pact, the
                                President said that such a pact “seems advisable.” He added “There
                                are no objections and, on the contrary, there are many
                                advantages.”</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Manila Bulletin</hi> featured the President’s
                                comments with a front-page headline “Quirino urges Pacific Pact,”
                                and other Manila newspapers also gave prominent attention to the
                                interview. The <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> also, in its issue of
                                March 21, continued to give editorial support to the idea of a
                                Pacific Pact. Other newspapers are also expected to comment
                                editorially on the subject within the next few days.</p>
                            <p>There is little doubt that the Philippine Government and Filipinos in
                                general are interested in the idea of a Pacific Pact. Most of them,
                                however, seem to have little confidence that such a pact can be
                                realized in the near future, if at all. The interest thus far
                                evidenced in the proposal reflects the anxious search of the
                                Filipinos for some measure of definite security against possible
                                outside aggression. It does not indicate any change in their basic
                                hope (and assumption, in many cases) that the United States will
                                come to the defense of the Philippines in the event of an emergency.
                                It does indicate that the Filipinos are anxious to have American
                                support and assistance whether it comes <pb n="1125"
                                    xml:id="pg_1125" facs="0539"/>in the form of a Pacific Pact or
                                whether it comes in the form of direct government-to-government
                                assistance from the United States.</p>

                                President Quirino’s press interview suggesting a Pacific pact
                                somewhat along the lines of North Atlantic agreement, President
                                Quirino told me he made the suggestion because he felt the moral and
                                economic chaos existing in much of the Far East could not be
                                improved without strong moral and economic leadership. He said he
                                felt the US is the only country that could supply a leadership
                                adequate to remedy existing conditions. He stated that by the
                                formation of a Pacific pact the leadership of the US, which would be
                                beneficial both to the Far Eastern nations and the US itself
                                regardless of whether or not the latter could commit itself with the
                                same firmness as in the Atlantic Pact or supply any appreciable
                                amount of military equipment.</p>
                            <p>Since the situation in China has produced uneasiness in a number of
                                Far Eastern countries, there has developed a strong desire to obtain
                                assistance and security from some potent source against the inroads
                                of Communism. In the case of the Philippines, I believe a feeling
                                exists that a substantial amount of the military equipment requested
                                by the Philippines will not be forthcoming under the military
                                assistance agreement. With this prevalent feeling President Quirino
                                turns toward the idea of a Pacific pact. Although assured that
                                over-all US military strength in the Far East is not being reduced
                                materially for the present he sees Philippine com [apparent
                                omission] almost completely disappearing and becomes more
                                apprehensive about Philippine security as the forces dwindle.
                                President Quirino is quite sincere in his desire to see a Pacific
                                pact. The formation of the Atlantic Pact has been generally well
                                received in the Philippines and the idea of a Pacific pact has been
                                received so far with enthusiasm.</p>

                                (on this as well as <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss> question,
                                Amb implied that Gen Romulo by his speeches had forced Pres
                                Quirino’s hand). Dir told him that he had understood Amb wished to
                                raise this question and that he had so notified his superiors. Dir
                                pointed out unique character of Atlantic Pact, calling Amb attention
                                to provisions therein making for its review at appropriate times.
                                Dir also referred to importance of existing bilateral arrangement
                                betw US and Philippines. Amb was able to give no indication that any
                                thought been given in Manila other than to name Pacific Pact. He
                                acknowledged awareness of attitude taken by Nehru and complexities
                                of situation as regards China, Japan and <gloss target="#t_NEI1"

                                indicate to him that it would not be good idea to play up Pacific
                                Pact and it would not, in present circumstances, evoke favorable
                                support from Wash. Amb Elizalde then went on say that in his

                                responsible for talk of Pacific Pact and he implied that it should
                                not be taken seriously.</p>

                            <p>783. ReEmbtel 758, March 22. In a further discussion with President
                                Quirino concerning his idea of a Pacific Pact the President stated
                                that all Far Eastern nations harbor a great fear of Japan. He said
                                it all means Japan should be a member of the Pacific Pact so that
                                its resurgence could be carefully observed and directed and so that
                                its responsibility to other Far Eastern nations would develop in the
                                right channels. The President said that Japan’s membership in a
                                Pacific Pact would tend to reduce the suspicions, fear and hatred
                                which exist toward that nation on the part of other Far Eastern
                                peoples. Knowing that President Quirino holds no love for the
                                Japanese, his idea that Japan should form a part of any Pacific Pact
                                is very significant. In such a pact he perceives the hope of
                                security and economic peace and <pb n="1127" xml:id="pg_1127"
                                    facs="0541"/>development in the Far East. President Quirino is
                                taking an intense interest in Far Eastern affairs and his leadership
                                would prove of great importance should the US participate in such a
                                movement. His friendship for the US is genuine and his desire is
                                that the moral, economic and democratic principles of the US should
                                be predominant in the Far East by means of a Pacific Pact. While the
                                North Atlantic Pact combined with other forces is striving to
                                maintain and assure peace in the future for Europe, I believe it
                                would be wise not to let the Far East crumble around us if there is
                                any way to avoid it. Some type of Pacific agreement might prove the
                                best means of more quickly bringing Japan to her responsibility
                                among nations and relieving the US of its burden in that
                                country.</p>

                                has not dampened the ardor of the advocates of the pact to any
                                perceptible degree as yet. President Quirino, on Saturday night,
                                March 26, in an address at the inauguration ceremony of the new club
                                house of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, renewed his
                                appeal for a Pacific pact and declared that the United States cannot
                                afford to neglect the Pacific basin, which is “the richest and most
                                important area in the world today.” The President reiterated his
                                belief that the leadership in the proposed Pacific pact should come
                                from the United States and not from a Far Eastern country. If the
                                President was quoted correctly on this specific point, what he
                                apparently had <pb n="1128" xml:id="pg_1128" facs="0542"/>reference
                                to was a recent statement of Nehru’s to the effect that the
                                leadership of the Pacific alliance should come from an Asiatic
                                country.</p>
                            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Manila Bulletin</hi>, in a front-page article
                                by Ralph G. Hawkins, on Monday, March 28, entitled “Envoy’s Report
                                on Pact Bid Reaction,” indicated that President Quirino had received
                                favorable reports from Philippine diplomatic emissaries abroad
                                concerning the reaction to his proposal. The first sentence in the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> article states “Ambassador
                                Joaquin Elizalde, reporting from Washington, said President
                                Quirino’s proposal for a defense pact among Pacific countries,
                                similar to the North Atlantic Pact recently consummated, had found
                                favorable reaction in official and public circles in the United
                                States.” This statement, coming from a usually reliable source, ties
                                in interestingly with the information conveyed in the Department’s
                                telegram of March 23. Apparently, Elizalde, while minimizing the
                                importance of talk about a Pacific pact to the Department in
                                Washington, may be sending the President rosy reports of Washington
                                reaction so as to please him.…</p>
                            <p>It is the Embassy’s considered opinion that the proposed Pacific pact
                                has aroused genuine interest here both in official and unofficial
                                circles. Few Filipinos hold out much hope that such a pact will
                                materialize, but most of them would, from all indications, be very
                                agreeable to such a pact. The average Filipino, be he in high or low
                                position, is today vitally concerned with the question of security
                                in the face of possible outside aggression, and if the proposed pact
                                were to hold any assurances of protection against outside
                                aggression, then he would most certainly be for the pact.</p>

                                the pact and the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> article referred to

                                        approaching <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> as a

                                    <item>This concept, however, has full meaning only if viewed in

                                            >SEA</gloss>. We should therefore view the <gloss

                                Southeast Asia—that of militant nationalism in Indonesia and
                                Indochina—cannot be resolved by any of the following policies on our
                                part: <list>

                            </p>
                            <p>Because the key to the solution of this issue lies primarily with the
                                Netherlands and France, we should as a matter of urgent importance
                                endeavor to induce the Dutch and the French to adapt their policies
                                to the realities of the current situation in Southeast Asia, as set
                                forth in this paper. Our first step should be, in conjunction with
                                the British, to set forth to the Dutch and French in candor, detail,
                                and with great gravity our interpretation of the situation in and
                                intentions with regard to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. We
                                should make a major effort to persuade them to <pb n="1130"
                                    xml:id="pg_1130" facs="0544"/>join us and the states mentioned
                                in the following paragraph in a constructive overall approach to the
                                region as a whole.</p>
                            <p>77. Having done this, we should promptly discuss with the British,
                                Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos and Australians a cooperative
                                approach based on the principles laid down in paragraph 75. We
                                should be prepared subsequently to work with a wider group, always
                                recognizing that while the area concerned is primarily Asian it is
                                in our interest to leaven the oriental nature of the collaboration
                                with sympathetic western influence. We should at the same time
                                attempt to discourage the extension of this cooperative effort to
                                include Middle and Near Eastern countries on the grounds that they
                                constitute a separate-natural regional group.</p>
                            <p>78. We should avoid at the outset urging an area organization.
                                Bather, our effort should initially be directed toward collaboration
                                on joint or parallel action and then, only as a pragmatic and
                                desirable basis for more intimate association appears, should we
                                encourage the area to move step by step toward formal organization.
                                If Asian leaders prematurely precipitate an area organization, we
                                should not give the impression of attempting to thwart such a move
                                but should go along with them while exerting a cautiously moderating
                                influence.</p>
                            <p>79. We should, of course, seek to cast the multilateral approach
                                recommended in the preceding four paragraphs within the framework of
                                the U.N. insofar as our Charter obligations require it and, where
                                there is no requirement, insofar as we consider it appropriate. We
                                should, however, be willing to act cooperatively outside of that
                                framework when that would be consistent with our Charter obligations
                                and when to proceed through U.N. mechanisms would constitute a
                                serious impediment to the achievement of our objectives.</p>
                            <p>80. In order to minimize suggestions of American imperialist
                                intervention, we should encourage the Indians, Filipinos and other
                                Asian states to take the public lead in political matters. Our role
                                should be the offering of discreet support and guidance.
                                Politically, Japan should be kept in the background.</p>
                            <p>81. We should seek vigorously to develop the economic interdependence
                                between <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>, as a supplier of raw
                                materials, and Japan, western Europe and India, as suppliers of
                                finished goods, with due recognition, however, of the legitimate
                                aspirations of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> countries for
                                some diversification of their economies. To achieve these ends we
                                should emphasize primarily the fourth point of the President’s
                                inaugural address.<note n="3" xml:id="d317fn3">January 20;

                                bilateral arrangements and through international agencies. The
                                propaganda value of the President’s fourth point should be fully
                                exploited.</p>

                            <p>82. We should greatly expand our cultural and informational program.
                                It should be directed at developing an appreciation and respect for
                                the humanistic values of western civilization and an understanding
                                of international political and economic realities.</p>

                                like-minded states, to bring about the creation of a sovereign
                                Indonesian state which will satisfy the fundamental demands of
                                militant nationalism in the archipelago. As the situation with
                                respect to Indonesia is now exceedingly confused and as it would
                                consequently be unrealistic to prescribe a hard and fast course of

                                        The longer the delay in accomplishing a transfer of
                                        authority from the Dutch to representative Indonesians, the
                                        weaker becomes the position of both the non-communist native
                                        leaders and the Dutch and the stronger becomes the influence
                                        of all extremist elements including the communists. The
                                        earliest feasible cessation of hostilities and transfer of
                                        authority from the Dutch to the Indonesians is therefore
                                        imperative, and will probably require additional pressure on
                                        the Dutch.</item>

                                        together with certain outstanding Federalists. As it is a
                                        combination of these two groups which can command the widest

                                        outside of the United States, the British Dominions, and
                                        possibly the Philippines.</item>

                                        Powers have our concept of civilization and in general our
                                        customs and ideals. To bring them into a Pacific Defense
                                        Pact, however, would open us to the accusation that we are
                                        underwriting the British, French and Dutch colonial
                                        policies, which it is certain that the American people do
                                        not wish to do and do not wish to be accused of
                                        doing.</item>

                            <p>An officer of the Embassy therefore pointed out to Dening that it
                                does not appear possible to have a Pacific Pact similar to the North
                                Atlantic Treaty except between the United States, the British
                                Dominions, and possibly the Philippines. The United States is
                                already underwriting the security of the Philippines and, therefore,
                                the Pact proposed by Australia would simply mean that the United
                                States would guarantee the security of the British Dominions in the
                                Pacific. Dening said that the proposed Pact in fact “boiled down” to
                                a desire by Australia that the United States should underwrite its
                                security, and added that it was “only human” for Australia to desire
                                this. Dening also said that some other type of Pact may be possible,
                                such as that mentioned by President Quirino of the Philippines, who
                                is advocating a Pact to combat Communism in the Far East.</p>
                            <p>There has been considerable comment in the British press regarding
                                alleged conversations between the four envoys recently sent to the
                                Dominions and the Dominion Governments regarding a Pacific Defense
                                Pact. Such newspaper reports have been denied by the Canadian
                                Government and by Sir Girja Bajpai, the Secretary General for the
                                Ministry of Foreign Affairs of India. The Embassy has also been
                                informed, both by the Foreign Office and by the Commonwealth
                                Relations Office, that they know nothing of any conversations
                                regarding a Pacific Defense Pact between the envoys sent abroad and
                                Dominion Governments. Dening of the Foreign Office said that the
                                whole thing seems to be a “pipe dream” of Australian politicians and
                                newspapermen.</p>

                            <p>The Russian threat to South East Asia for some time to come is
                                unlikely to be a military one. But there is a distinct danger that,
                                as measures are developed for the security of Europe and the Middle
                                East, pressure upon South East Asia will increase. Conditions there
                                are generally speaking favourable for the spread of Communism, and
                                if the general impression prevails in South East Asia that the
                                Western Powers are both unwilling and unable to assist in resisting
                                Russian pressure, the psychological effect may be that local
                                resistance is weakened, with the result that the process of
                                undermining the systems of government in that region will succeed to
                                the extent that eventually the whole of South East Asia will fall a
                                victim to the Communist advance and thus come under Russian
                                domination without any military effort on the part of Russia.</p>
                            <p>If this general concept is correct, it would seem to follow that we
                                must try to take steps to stiffen the will to resist on the part of
                                South East Asian territories simultaneously with our efforts to
                                strengthen the defensive position of Europe and the Middle East. It
                                may be argued that even the resources of the United States, joined
                                with the still very limited resources of Europe, are insufficient to
                                undertake commitments in South East Asia as well as in Europe and
                                the Middle East. But our preliminary examination of the position
                                suggests that no vast resources are required, and that at any rate
                                in the initial stages the question is one of political and economic
                                effort rather than of large-scale outright aid. The alternative to
                                such effort would appear to be the abandonment of the whole position
                                with consequences which can only react adversely upon the political
                                and economic situation of the world and give great encouragement to
                                the world-wide spread of Communism.</p>
                            <p>If South East Asia is to be built up as an area of resistance to
                                Russian expansion, no purely Western approach is likely to succeed
                                unless the various Asiatic Governments are persuaded of the
                                necessity to build up this resistance and are willing to take upon
                                their shoulders the principal burden involved. Any attempt, for
                                example, to create an area of resistance in the Indian sub-continent
                                without the full co-operation and even initiative of India and
                                Pakistan would be doomed to <pb n="1136" xml:id="pg_1136"
                                    facs="0550"/>failure. On the other hand, if these and other
                                governments in South East Asia can be pursuaded of the necessity, in
                                their own interests, of building up an area of resistance which
                                Russia would hesitate to attack, and if a serious effort is made by
                                the Governments concerned to stabilize the position in South East
                                Asia, then the Western Powers, including the United States, may be
                                able to contribute towards the fulfilment of this aim, even though
                                only to a limited extent, by technical assistance and advice, by the
                                provision of capital goods and even by the comparatively small-scale
                                provision of armaments.</p>
                            <p>It is recognised that a number of major difficulties will have to be
                                overcome before the countries of South East Asia are in any position
                                to band together in a common resistance against Russian expansion.
                                The friction between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the North West
                                Frontier Province; the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India:
                                the conflict between the Burmese Government and the Karens in Burma;
                                the uneasy political situation in Siam; the conflict with the Viet
                                Minh in <gloss target="#t_Indo1">Indo</gloss>-China; the Communist
                                attacks in Malaya; and, finally, the Indonesian situation; all
                                militate against the creation of a common front. Nevertheless, if a
                                realisation of the real significance of the Communist menace can be
                                brought home to all these territories, this may encourage the
                                settlement of local disputes, and all our efforts are already being
                                directed towards doing everything that can be done in the diplomatic
                                field to bring about such settlements.</p>
                            <p>The United Kingdom is in a special relationship with South East Asia
                                by virtue of the Commonwealth relationship which now exists with
                                India, Pakistan and Ceylon as a result of the attainment of
                                independence by these countries. There is also the treaty
                                relationship with Burma; our position in the Western Union results
                                in close contacts with the French and the Dutch; we have a close
                                relationship with Siam; and finally, there is our own position in
                                Malaya, in Borneo and in Hong Kong. The surge of nationalism which
                                has manifested itself in South East Asia since the war, however,
                                renders all these Asiatic countries very suspicious of anything
                                which savours either of imperialism, or of dictation or domination
                                by the West. Nor are the South East Asia countries likely to be at
                                all attracted by the possibility that closer relationship with the
                                West will involve them in hostilities with Russia on a European
                                issue, with which they would regard themselves as having no concern.
                                In these circumstances, South East Asia territories are only likely
                                to be willing to unite in a common front against Russian expansion
                                if they regard it as in their own self-interest. It follows
                                therefore that their own self-interest should provide the
                                inspiration for the unity which is necessary if Russian pressure is
                                to be resisted successfully.</p>
                            <p>It might be argued that such unity in South East Asia might create a
                                fresh danger of a pan-Asiatic union hostile to the West. But
                                provided <pb n="1137" xml:id="pg_1137" facs="0551"/>that friendly
                                and close relations are maintained, and provided the South East Asia
                                countries realise that mutual co-operation between South East Asia
                                and the West on a basis of equality and of mutual self-interest is
                                necessary for the maintenance of peace and stability in South East
                                Asia, this danger should not arise.</p>
                            <p>The above, in broad outline, is the general direction in which we
                                think we should go. Many difficulties remain to be overcome, and
                                many susceptibilities will have to be taken into account. Above all,
                                any suggestion that the United Kingdom or the United States seek to
                                dominate the situation in South East Asia must be avoided. The fully
                                sovereign governments of South East Asia must be prepared to take
                                the initiative themselves, but we might hope to prompt that
                                initiative. We also hope they can be brought to realise that our
                                co-operation for the attainment of their own ends will be necessary,
                                at any rate for many years to come. If a common front can be built

                                inclusive, then it should be possible to contain the Russian advance
                                southwards, to rehabilitate and stabilise the area, and to preserve
                                our communications across the middle of the world. A stable South
                                East Asia may also eventually influence the situation in China and
                                make it possible to redress the position there.</p>

                            <p>The conclusion is therefore that, while the strategic necessities of
                                Europe and the Middle East are greater and should have priority, the
                                requirements of South East Asia, though in a different category, are
                                of vital importance.</p>
                            <p>We should therefore, parallel with our efforts in Europe and the
                                Middle East, do our utmost to encourage a spirit of co-operation and
                                self-reliance in South East Asia with a view to the creation of a
                                common front against Russian expansion in that area.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> outlined his concept of present
                                world geographical-political factors. Since 1945 he had been
                                thinking along the following lines. It was to be expected that
                                Soviet Russia would succeed in expanding in the agricultural areas
                                of the world. The Western world must hold the “outer crust”
                                extending from Scandinavia to Turkey and including the Middle East.
                                At Potsdam he had opposed Four-Powered Ruhr control since this was
                                an industrial resource which must be preempted for the West. The
                                presence of U.S. troops in Europe was an additional reassurance. So
                                far we have done well in Europe. Some day Western Europe will
                                overcome the obstacles of Nationalism and will develop a
                                multilateral system. This was the concept the British Cabinet
                                approved in 1945 by taking the “terrific decision” to get the UK
                                into Europe.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> said we should now look ahead to
                                the primary producing countries. He had nothing against the Jews but
                                he was trying to hold the Arabs in line, since he was convinced that
                                the 100 million Moslems were one of the biggest potential forces in
                                the world. The UK was the best window toward this area. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> did not favor the elaboration of
                                joint military pacts for this sphere, but thought the US and UK
                                should adopt a common line for the development of the great
                                potential resources needed for our defense, particularly oil.
                                Moreover, he foresaw an industrial recession may eventually occur
                                and it was advisable now to plan for the creation of new capital
                                goods.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> said that once the Palestine
                                question is out of the way, he hoped to concentrate on two or three
                                great potential developments in the Middle East, which he proceeded
                                to enumerate. There were the Lake Victoria and Lake Tana water
                                schemes and furthermore a project for the growing of jute in
                                southern Egypt. The Euphrates scheme offered the possibility of
                                establishing, under good living conditions, a five or six million
                                population who could withstand Soviet pressure. Afghanistan, and
                                particularly Persia, also offered many possibilities and it was
                                desirable to finish the oil pipeline south of Aqbar. The Arab
                                refugees from Palestine were a problem, however, which was being
                                studied. Some 40,000 could be resettled on the slopes of the Jordan
                                and he was putting pressure on the Syrian government for the
                                settlement <pb n="1139" xml:id="pg_1139" facs="0553"/>of between
                                200,000 and 300,000 in northern Syria. He hoped the rest could be
                                absorbed in TransJordan.</p>
                            <p>As regards Arabia and this general area, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr.
                                    Bevin</hi> favored an economic drive by the Western countries
                                which would not be military in character, nor even primarily
                                political. Development was important for the capital goods market
                                and also for the production of food. On the whole, the Moslems were
                                sensible people and he hoped that we can hold these 100 million for
                                the West. He would like a US/UK working party set up for the
                                coordination of plans.</p>
                            <p>With respect to India, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> mentioned
                                that the Prime Minister had written the President. Coordination was
                                necessary here also, since haphazard planning could lead to needless
                                irritations.</p>
                            <p>With respect to Southeast Asia, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi>
                                mentioned the Dutch seemed to be coming into line but we must tell
                                the Republicans they must play, too. He was upset by a proposal made
                                in New York that the Republican government and Army return to
                                Jogjakarta. The government had no civil service and chaos might
                                result if the situation is not rightly handled. It is time for us to
                                tell the other side, namely the Republicans, what we want.</p>
                            <p>According to Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bevin</hi>, 60 percent of the
                                people in Southeast Asia are Moslems and Russia has an opening here.
                                The UK could exercise influence through Pakistan but hoped for U.S.
                                help. The UK was moving slowly in Malaya but was broadening the
                                basis of self government. With general reference to Indonesia,
                                Burma, and Malaya, he would like to see a sort of Southeast Asian
                                conference arrangement in which the US, UK, Australia, and New
                                Zealand could cooperate for economic and political purposes, as
                                distinct from a military understanding or pact for this area which
                                should not be considered now. I interposed we might like to set up a
                                kind of “Caribbean Commission” for Southeast Asia.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> said that China seemed to be
                                lost to us. He had furnished the U.S. with a documentary survey and
                                would like to exchange opinions with us. As regards Hong Kong, he
                                said the UK intended to stand firm, making it, if necessary, a sort
                                of “Berlin of the East”, which could be used to influence the
                                Chinese situation whatever might eventuate. The UK would assert its
                                rights and he doubted if they would be challenged. (In reply to Mr.
                                Bevin’s question, I said that the thought of another Berlin, if this
                                involved another airlift, filled me with considerable distaste!)</p>
                            <p>Summing up, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> said the next big
                                step was to proceed vigorously with economic, as distinct from
                                military, development of the Middle East. India should be helped to
                                reduce famine. Southeast Asia should be cleaned up in a kind of
                                “conference arrangement”. He wished to be informed about U.S. policy
                                in Japan and he would like <pb n="1140" xml:id="pg_1140" facs="0554"
                                />to examine the Chinese situation with us so that there might be
                                joint understanding.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I told Mr. Bevin that the President was greatly interested
                                in the development of the Middle East which he regarded as the other
                                side of the medal of Western European recovery.</p>
                            <p>As the President sees the problem, if no new markets are developed
                                after the termination of ERP in 1952, friction will occur and an
                                unbalance will take place in the bargaining position of the West
                                with the East. The Eastern countries would be in a strong position
                                to exploit barter arrangements by their rigid production controls,
                                but if there are other places than Europe to which the Western
                                European countries can look, they will be in a better position
                                vis-à-vis the East. The President was extremely interested in the
                                Euphrates scheme. He wished, however, to concentrate on development
                                problems and not diffuse our energies.</p>
                            <p>I said we wished to proceed on an international front and would like
                                to find some instrumentality, such as the International Bank or
                                other agency, through which we could act. Because of budgetary
                                deficits, we did not see our way clear to using U.S. Government
                                financing for the development of Point IV of the President’s
                                Program, and we thought the International Bank is the appropriate
                                and competent organization for this purpose. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >Mr. Bevin</hi> said he will examine the list of international
                                agencies which might be of help, but he pointed out that some of the
                                schemes may not be sufficiently definite to be handled in this way
                                at this time.</p>
                            <p>I said we were doubtful about India and that so far our thinking had
                                only been along vague lines. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi>
                                suggested we send experts to get in touch with planning groups who
                                have been working on India and Africa under Sir Stafford Cripps.</p>
                            <p>With respect to Indonesia, I recognized the situation could go to
                                pieces. The Dutch had stupidly delayed some obvious decisions. I had
                                urged the earliest dispatch of Van Royen to that area and had
                                assured the Dutch that Cochran will work with him. The main thing is
                                to get the Dutch and the Republicans talking together.</p>
                            <p>I said we had given a great deal of thought to China. The
                                Nationalists seem to be washed up and the Communists able to go
                                where they wished. The Chinese are tired and disillusioned. Help to
                                the Nationalists can have a contrary effect, since the Chinese might
                                take the view it is only prolonging a war which must end. We had
                                abandoned the idea of supporting the regime and were only extending
                                to June 2 a further 58 million dollars under the China Aid Act. We
                                thought the Moscow-trained Communists will be diluted, and that
                                Chinese inertia and the corruption of the civil service will
                                overcome them. After all the Chinese Communists must deal with the
                                West to a certain extent, since Russia has no resources to offer. It
                                had been difficult in this country <pb n="1141" xml:id="pg_1141"
                                    facs="0555"/>publicly to withdraw support from the Nationalists,
                                but the extreme supporters of Chiang Kai-shek in Congress were
                                gaining a better appreciation of realities. The U.S. henceforth will
                                pursue a more realistic policy respecting China.</p>
                            <p>As regards Japan, I said the Far Eastern Commission had become
                                useless, since it had become a forum for Soviet complaints. However,
                                we will let it go its way. Since the U.S. is spending about 900
                                million dollars a year in Japan, MacArthur has been told to take
                                more vigorous steps toward recovery. While reparations in themselves
                                are not much of a drain, they are a confusing factor in the Japanese
                                economy and we shall let them fall into oblivion. There was small
                                chance of a treaty being concluded, and as far as I knew, no work
                                was being done along these lines at present.</p>
                            <p>As regards the parts of the world we have discussed, <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bevin</hi> said we seem to agree we should
                                try to clean things up, leaving Japan out of account for the time
                                being and also China, which appeared to be lost. While we had
                                suffered a terrible blow in China, he was not too pessimistic and
                                thought we could get along without it. Many of the Chinese would
                                still be on our side, and after all, Great Britain had got along by
                                letting the U.S. go its own way in earlier times.</p>
                            <p>At the end of our talk, which lasted an hour, Mr. Bevin left with me
                                a Top Secret memorandum on Southeast Asia.<note n="1"

                            <p>During the course of a courtesy call today by the Korean Ambassador,
                                the latter raised the question of a Pacific counter-part to the
                                Atlantic Pact.</p>
                            <p>I pointed out to the Ambassador that the Atlantic Pact was the
                                product of a specific set of circumstances which are peculiar to
                                Europe and the Atlantic community and which are not even closely
                                duplicated in the Pacific area. While granting the very real threat
                                posed by Soviet intentions and capabilities in the Far East, I
                                emphasized that conditions in that area do not at the present time
                                lend themselves to the type <pb n="1142" xml:id="pg_1142"
                                    facs="0556"/>of approach embodied in the Atlantic Pact. To
                                demonstrate this point, I went on to underline the variety of
                                difficulties—the fluid situation in China, the attitude of Pandit
                                Nehru, etc.—which would be involved in drawing in the Far East a
                                firm line beyond which any further Soviet penetration would be
                                regarded as aggression against the entire community of signatory
                                powers.</p>
                            <p>The Ambassador said that he recognized these difficulties, and had
                                raised the subject merely because his Government had expressed
                                interest in the conclusion of a Pacific pact.</p>

                            <p>The Secretary of State made several statements at a press conference
                                on May 18, one of which dealt with the subject of a Pacific Pact
                                corresponding to the North Atlantic Treaty of April 4. Issued as a
                                press release on May 18, this statement by Secretary Acheson was as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“While the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty does not
                                        mean any lessening of our interest in the security of other
                                        areas, as I have taken the pains to make clear on several
                                        occasions, the United States is not currently considering
                                        participation in any further special collective defense
                                        arrangements other than the North Atlantic Treaty.</p>
                                    <p>Recently there have been a number of public suggestions about
                                        a Pacific pact modeled after the North Atlantic Treaty. It
                                        seems to me that some of those who make such suggestions may
                                        not have given study to the evolution of the North Atlantic
                                        Treaty, which was largely the product of a specific set of
                                        circumstances peculiar to Europe and the Atlantic
                                        community—the logical culmination of a long series of
                                        developments. Practical plans for effective collaboration
                                        for defense were in progress among the principal countries
                                        of Western Europe long before steps were taken to extend
                                        such collaboration to provide for the security of the North
                                        Atlantic as an integrated whole. There thus existed a solid
                                        foundation on which to build.</p>
                                    <p>While it is true that there are serious dangers to world
                                        peace existing in the situation in Asia, it is also true, as
                                        Prime Minister Nehru of India stated to the press the other
                                        day, that a Pacific defense pact could not take shape until
                                        present internal conflicts in Asia were resolved. He was
                                        quoted as going on to say that the time was not ripe for a
                                        pact corresponding to the North Atlantic Treaty, owing to
                                        these conflicts. Nehru’s view appears to be an objective
                                        appraisal of the actual, practical possibilities at the
                                        present time.” (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Secretary of State Acheson is quoted as having said
                                        yesterday to a press conference that the time is not right
                                        for a Pacific pact, in view of the disturbed situation in
                                        certain countries in Asia. Do you care to comment on this,
                                        Mr. President?</p>
                                    <p>“Answer: I really do not know what Secretary Acheson was
                                        referring to when he referred to disturbed situations in
                                        Asia. I think a Pacific pact will be beneficial not only to
                                        Asia but to the United States. But if the United States does
                                        not take kindly to the idea, I think that Asia as a whole
                                        can take action. I think there are a good many countries,
                                        like the Philippines, Australia, and some of the South
                                        American states bordering on the Pacific, which will be
                                        interested in a pact. Later on, the United States may be
                                        ready to participate in a pact.</p>
                                    <p>“Question: Mr. President, have any concrete steps been taken
                                        by any other countries to negotiate a Pacific pact?</p>
                                    <p>“Answer: No concrete steps have been taken by other
                                        countries, as far as I know. But some messages have been
                                        exchanged in some quiet way, and some countries themselves
                                        have indicated that they are interested.</p>
                                    <p>“Question: Mr. President, you just said that some messages
                                        have been exchanged in connection with a Pacific pact, and
                                        that some countries have indicated their interest in a pact.
                                        I wonder if you could tell us what countries have exchanged
                                        messages or expressed interest?</p>
                                    <p>“Answer: I think it is a little bit premature for me to
                                        mention what countries are participating. You know that the
                                        State Department is not in favor of the pact. And you know
                                        that the other day the Australian Foreign Minister<note
                                            n="1" xml:id="d325fn1">Herbert V. Evatt, Australian
                                            Minister for External Affairs.</note> declared in favor
                                        of the pact. About the South American states, I would rather
                                        not make any statement.</p>
                                    <p>“Question: Secretary Acheson said that in Europe preliminary
                                        discussions had taken place before the negotiation of the
                                        North Atlantic Pact, but that they had not yet taken place
                                        in Asia or the Pacific. Do you care to comment on this, Mr.
                                        President?</p>
                                    <p>“Answer: I think I had better not start a discussion on this
                                        question. I know there are reasons for Secretary Acheson’s
                                        policy. However, countries are interested in the pact.</p>
                                    <p>“Question: Acheson stated that the pact was not feasible now
                                        because of disturbances in certain areas of Asia but when
                                        affairs resolved themselves talks could begin again. Do you
                                        care to comment, Mr. President, on the disturbed situations,
                                        especially in China, and their relation to the pact?</p>
                                    <p>“Answer: I think that reason is very weak. All democratic
                                        nations should not wait, but should take definite action and
                                        help build up the democratic camp, instead of remaining
                                        neutral. They should settle the <pb n="1145"
                                            xml:id="pg_1145" facs="0559"/>Communist problem in favor
                                        of the democratic countries. I do not see why the democratic
                                        countries should not band together and form a defense bloc.
                                        If we open up a Pacific pact and invite the Kuomintang, I
                                        think that this is strengthening the democratic elements in
                                        China rather than weakening them. The democratic nations
                                        must stand together and show some backbone, rather than
                                        standing individually. In the First and Second World Wars
                                        the democratic nations got the worst of it. Why? The
                                        totalitarian powers stuck together and took the democratic
                                        countries one by one. Hang together or hang separately. I
                                        think in China all the democratic nations of the world are
                                        abandoning rather than helping democratic elements.”</p>

                            <p>Mr. Drumright saw the Korean Foreign Minister<note n="2"

                                    C. Limb.</note> at a dinner given by the British Minister last
                                evening. Mr. Drumright engaged the Foreign Minister in conversation
                                following the dinner. He said that according to a Seoul newspaper
                                report of May 25, the Foreign Minister was quoted as saying that a
                                Pacific Pact would be concluded at the earliest possible time for
                                the purpose of maintaining Asian and world peace. Mr. Drumright told
                                the Foreign Minister that he would be grateful for any information
                                which the Foreign Minister could give him with respect to this
                                subject.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister said it was the thought of his Government that a
                                Pacific Pact was desirable. He went on to say that some preliminary
                                steps had been taken with a view to initiating discussions among
                                concerned Pacific area countries. He said further that the matter of
                                a Pacific Pact was being discussed at the present time between the
                                Korean and Philippine Governments. The Foreign Minister then spoke
                                of the Asiatic components of the British Commonwealth of Nations,
                                saying that they could provide a valuable nucleus on which to
                                develop a Pacific Pact. The Foreign Minister said that he expected
                                to discuss this prospect with the British Minister shortly. The
                                Foreign Minister then mentioned the countries which he thought might
                                be interested in a Pacific Pact. These are: Korea, Philippines,
                                Australia, New Zealand, Burma, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Siam,
                                Canada, and several countries along the west coast of Central and
                                South America.</p>
                            <pb n="1146" xml:id="pg_1146" facs="0560"/>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister expressed the view that the United States could
                                not very well object to the discussion of a Pacific Pact among the
                                nations he had just mentioned. Should the discussions have fruitful
                                results, he expected that the countries concerned might then
                                approach the United States with the request that it participate.</p>
                            <p>(Mr. Drumright gathered from his conversation with the Foreign
                                Minister that the discussions referred to by the Foreign Minister
                                have hitherto been limited to an exchange of views with the
                                Philippine Government. It would appear that if the prospects seem
                                favorable, these two countries might take the initiative in the
                                calling of a conference of the Pacific nations mentioned above to
                                discuss the conclusion of a Pacific Pact.)</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Suggested Attacks on Power Bloc Theory</p>
                            <p>One of the most serious obstacles to the achieving of the orientation
                                of the governments and peoples of South Asia toward the United
                                States and the western democracies is the wide-spread concept in
                                that area that the United States and the USSR are respectively heads
                                of clearly defined power blocs, that there is little difference
                                between the fundamental objectives of the blocs, and that the role
                                of South Asia should be the creation of a third “force” to act as
                                mediator between the two blocs already existing. Most articulate
                                exponent of this concept is Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India
                                whose great personal prestige in the area provides millions of
                                unquestioning followers. The new Indian Ambassador in Washington,
                                Madame Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the Prime Minister’s sister, is
                                supporting the same point of view in the numerous public addresses
                                which she is making throughout the United States. Since the recent
                                decision of India to remain in the British Commonwealth there have
                                been indications that one objective in so doing might be the
                                persuasion of the Commonwealth members to join the third “neutral
                                force” leading to a virtual isolation of the two “aggressive blocs”
                                led by the US and the USSR.</p>
                            <p>The American Ambassador in New Delhi, Mr. Loy W. Henderson, has
                                repeatedly attacked this theory along the lines that cooperation
                                among nations for the purpose of frustrating aggressive tendencies
                                of certain countries or groups of countries does not constitute the
                                formation of a power bloc and that the United States is not in fact
                                a member <pb n="1147" xml:id="pg_1147" facs="0561"/>of any such bloc
                                but stands rather for mutual understanding and collaboration within
                                the framework of the United Nations of all countries genuinely
                                devoted to the furtherance of world peace. The Ambassador has been
                                handicapped in the exposition of this doctrine by the tendency among
                                even American authors to write of the “two power blocs” in the
                                world. He has, therefore, recommended that a high official of our
                                Government in the immediate future attempt to explode from a
                                platform commanding world attention the theory of two antithetical
                                power blocs.</p>
                            <p>Although it is recognized that numerous general policy pronouncements
                                have been made in the past emphasizing US confidence in the UN
                                rather than in power blocs, because of the value that a clear
                                restatement of this point would have in American relations with
                                countries of its area, <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss>
                                recommends that serious consideration be given to implementing
                                Ambassador Henderson’s recommendation at the earliest appropriate
                                opportunity either by the Secretary of State or by the

                                <p>1. It is apparent that in the American public mind our policy
                                    toward Asia is suffering from an acute case of negativism. That
                                    the objective situation in East and South Asia does not permit a
                                    wide range of solid action on our part is not adequately
                                    understood and, even if it were, would not satisfy the demand in
                                    the American nature for “positive action”. The White Paper on

                                        (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1949).</note> may
                                    do much to provide a rational explanation for our policy of
                                    disengagement in China. We have little to be ashamed of in that
                                    record and much of which to be proud. While the White Paper will
                                    go far toward justifying our policy toward China and quiet most
                                    of our critics, it will also probably provide some fuel for the
                                    more extreme partisan critics of our policy in the Far East.
                                    Furthermore, the issuance of that paper will be, essentially,
                                    another negative act. The public may say, “Very well, you were
                                    right in not doing anything, but where do we go from here?”</p>
                                <p>2. A change of climate is needed in our policy toward East and
                                    South Asia. It is needed not only to win the confidence and
                                    support of the American public. It is needed also to improve the
                                    psychological atmosphere in East and South Asia, an atmosphere
                                    which is becoming surcharged with nervous apprehension.</p>
                                <p>3. The course of action presented below is directed at bringing
                                    about this necessary change in political climate. It is designed
                                    to achieve, so far as is possible, certain tangible objectives.
                                    But because there is so little that we can do in a concrete way
                                    in East and South Asia, the true measure of our success will not
                                    be in what we do but how we do it. The political climate in East
                                    and South: Asia is going to be noticeably improved only if we
                                    undertake the following actions with a real sense of theater. In
                                    this oriental setting, the gesture and the show are as important
                                    as the substantial deed.</p>
                                <p>4. The following proposed actions are cast in the form of a
                                    detailed timetable. This has been done in an attempt, not to lay
                                    down a hard and fast operational schedule, but to emphasize the
                                    necessity of comprehensive and closely-timed actions on a wide
                                    front if we are to create a new and hopeful atmosphere in our
                                    East and South Asian policy. The following suggestions are
                                    therefore subject to modification both in timing and in
                                    substance.</p>

                                <p>6. President Quirino should be invited to visit Washington for

                                    the Far East. This invitation and the reason for it should be

                                <p>7. If in our present examination of the Japanese problem we find
                                    that we can, within three or four months, move toward a peace
                                    settlement with that country without jeopardizing our essential
                                    security interests, we should do so. And as we do so, we should
                                    prepare the American public for the forthcoming changes,
                                    including those mentioned in paragraph 22. At the same time, we
                                    should, through diplomatic means, thoroughly prepare the ground

                                    now taking place between the Dutch and the Indonesians.</p>
                                <p>9. We should continue our efforts to strengthen the Thai
                                    Government by (1) expediting the transfer to Thailand of the
                                    gold at Tokyo claimed by the Thai Government; (2) organizing
                                    technical missions to assist the Thai Government in its
                                    agricultural and industrial reconstruction programs; (3)

                                    facilitate future Thai procurement of military equipment in this
                                    country; and (4) instituting periodic naval visits with naval

                                    main conclusions to be drawn from the White Paper and sets forth
                                    in broad, affirmative, confident tones the future course of our
                                    policy with respect not only to China but also to East and South

                                    attended by wide publicity concluding with a joint communiqué
                                    announcing close U.S.-Philippine collaboration in the Far East.
                                    We should give Quirino: <list>

                                    of East and South Asia and the U.S. collaborate in training
                                    native technicians for the development of their individual

                                    While the attraction that such an institution would exert
                                    throughout the region would be largely technical, it should be
                                    our purpose that the university have a political significance
                                    through developing a consciousness of interdependence within

                                    the Philippines and Australia on the desirability of a Three
                                    Power Defense Treaty, along the general lines of the Atlantic
                                    Pact, composed initially of the U.S., the Philippines and
                                    Australia, Eventually, this pact should embrace these three
                                    countries plus Canada, Japan and possibly New Zealand.</p>
                                <p>17. If Australia and the Philippines are willing to go along with
                                    us, we should begin conversations, looking toward the creation
                                    of such a defensive arrangement and make public announcement of
                                    that fact.</p>
                                <p>18. Provided that we have come to a conclusion that we can move

                                    our minimum desiderata, and provided that we have firm reason to
                                    believe that the Japanese Government and people would welcome an
                                    invitation to join the three-power treaty, we should propose the
                                    convocation of a peace conference composed of the <gloss

                                    should promptly move to draft a treaty of our own and obtain the
                                    concurrence of whatever powers wish to participate or, if none
                                    do, on a basis of direct negotiation between the U.S. and
                                    Japan.</p>
                                <p>19. If we decide that American bases should be retained in Japan,
                                    we should have, in addition to assurances of Japan’s desire to
                                    adhere to the three-power treaty, a clear understanding that
                                    Japan will, as its contribution to the treaty obligations,
                                    invite the U.S. to establish the bases which we seek.</p>

                            <p>It seems to us Chinese would have most gain from inclusion

                            <p>A good start toward organizing the Pacific peoples in their fight
                                against Communism has been made by President Elpidio Quirino of the
                                Philippine Republic and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of China. As I
                                have made plain on several occasions, the Republic of Korea stands
                                ready to join in this movement. Although I have not received an
                                official report on the Baguio conference, press reports telling of
                                the common understandings reached by the two leaders in their
                                discussions are highly encouraging. They see, as we see and as all
                                free nations of the world must see, that the common enemy is
                                Communism. <pb n="1153" xml:id="pg_1153" facs="0567"/>The way to
                                stop a forest fire is to fight it. We are all in the forest;
                                everyone must join the fight or get burnt in this world-threatening
                                conflagration. I sincerely hope that the Generalissimo or President
                                Quirino or both can pay us a visit at this time and let us know how
                                we Koreans can best aid our mutual fight against Red terror and

                            <p>My reaction to your suggestion of consolidating a united front in
                                regard to China and the Far East generally is strongly
                                affirmative.</p>
                            <p>As to method, I believe the first approach should be made either
                                through our Ambassadors in the respective Capitals or through the
                                Foreign Embassies in Washington. I do not think we should begin by
                                having any kind of a meeting until there has been some exploratory
                                conversation. I do not think it is feasible at this stage for me to
                                make the trip suggested by Kennan in paragraph 12 of his memorandum
                                of July 7.<note n="1" xml:id="d331fn1">See annex to memorandum of
                                    July 8, <ref target="#pg_1148">p. 1148</ref>.</note> One of the
                                first things would be to determine the list of countries to be
                                consulted.</p>
                            <p>As to substance, I think we should discuss inter alia: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>the problems of continued recognition of the Nationalist
                                        Government and of non-recognition of the Communist
                                        Government;</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>protection of nationals in Communist areas; and</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>trade with Communist areas.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>I do not think that this effort to build a united front would
                                preclude proceeding with some of the other steps suggested by Kennan
                                in his memorandum of July 7. For example, I think his suggestion in
                                paragraph 6 about the visit of President Quirino is good. I
                                understand that the presidential election is in November and that a
                                visit of Quirino here in the fall would be helpful to him. Query
                                whether there would be any undesirable elements in having it known
                                that the invitation had been issued so soon after the
                                Generalissimo’s visit to Baguio. Offhand I should think not.</p>
                            <p>I should hope that we could also act upon some of the suggestions in
                                Kennan’s paragraph 9 regarding Thailand.</p>
                            <p>I think we ought to keep up steady pressure on the French to promote
                                favorable developments in Indochina and avoid a new Indonesian
                                situation.</p>
                            <pb n="1154" xml:id="pg_1154" facs="0568"/>
                            <p>I like very much Kennan’s suggestion in paragraph 14 for a University
                                in Manila. This is the kind of psychological move which we rarely
                                undertake and which can be particularly valuable in the Far East.
                                Private foundations might be interested in assisting with this
                                project.</p>
                            <p>I am quite unfamiliar with the Japanese Peace Treaty situation, but
                                offhand it seems to me it would be very useful to press ahead with
                                plans for a peace conference while we can still use the Nationalist
                                Chinese Government even though the Soviet Union boycotts the
                                conference.</p>
                            <p>I think we should make very special efforts in connection with
                                Nehru’s visit in the fall. Columbia University is inviting him
                                there, and I think some similar attention from some of our other
                                leading universities might be highly desirable. I have personally
                                supported Columbia’s invitation in a letter to Mrs. Pandit.</p>

                                joint statement issued Baguio evening July 11 by President Quirino
                                and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“During the past 2 days, we had a full exchange of views on
                                        matters concerning Sino-Filipino cooperation and the
                                        relations among all the Far Eastern countries. We both feel
                                        happy to state that throughout the meeting, the atmosphere
                                        was permeated with a spirit of frankness and harmony.</p>
                                    <p>In our discussions, we agreed that the relations between
                                        China and the Philippines should be further strengthened and
                                        that concrete and practical measures should immediately be
                                        taken by our respective governments for the promotion of a
                                        closer economic and cultural cooperation.</p>
                                    <p>We also had a full discussion on the imperative of
                                        coordinated full development of the Far Eastern countries in
                                        order to insure their stability and security. In view of the
                                        lack of close collaboration among them in the past, and
                                        considering the gravity of the Communist menace which
                                        confronts their freedom and independence today, we deem it
                                        necessary that these countries should at once organize
                                        themselves into a union for the purpose of achieving
                                        solidarity and mutual assistance to contain and counteract
                                        that common threat.</p>

                                should be convened at the earliest possible moment to devise
                                concrete measures for its organization. It is our hope that other

                                Netherlands Minister has highly developed political sense and
                                succeeded obtaining information some of which Quirino probably would
                                not have conveyed any US representative. He July 13 passed on to me

                                        point view US authorities. Quirino told Toussaint he did not
                                        know whether US would invite him but felt Baguio talks might
                                        provide US additional incentive do so.</item>

                                neglecting real friends in Far East, while even the USSR is helping

                                through humiliations in US.</p>
                            <p>Italian Minister has informed officer Embassy [that] Quirino also
                                quoted Chiang as saying US post-war aid could not be used in
                                reconstruction North China, so Chinese Government had retained and
                                still holds funds intended therefor. Quirino told both Italian
                                Minister and myself Chiang says he still has 21/2 million troops or
                                about as much as Communists, can fight 3 years more, will fight to
                                last ditch in China, and was not seeking asylum. Quirino quoted
                                Chiang as saying he was in general well-received Taiwan and is able
                                draw from it assistance mostly in shape supplies. He said some of
                                Chinese oppose him, but they are in cahoots with Communists. As for
                                Philippine military assistance to China, Quirino told me, it is out
                                of question as “You have not fulfilled your commitments to me under
                                the military assistance pact”.<note n="1" xml:id="d335fn1">Signed at

                            <p>When he first mentioned the idea of a Pacific Union, Quirino told me,
                                he had no other thought than that the US should be its rightful
                                leader. As the US too indifferent or occupied, the Philippines,
                                China, and Korea had gone ahead to develop cooperative measures
                                protect themselves against advance communism. Should the US wish to
                                participate, it would of course be welcome.</p>
                            <p>The union, he said, is primarily not military, but social and
                                economic. Philippine economic aid to China, he thought could best be
                                in the guise of expanded exports to that country. I asked what
                                products China wants are produced here, and he replied shipments
                                might be composed US goods now imported duty-free into Philippines
                                which Philippines could then reexport China. (Comment: I doubt the
                                President has thought this through.)</p>
                            <p>When I asked about plans for further meetings, Quirino said at first
                                meeting, which purely preliminary, it was decided he should take
                                lead, and he wanted Romulo come home latter part next week, work out
                                further details. He added he wants show that he considers this task
                                more important than that Romulo doing in US [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >UN</hi>]. Romulo is to sound out other Pacific nations,
                                including Indonesia and Australia. Quirino said he told Netherlands
                                Minister that Indonesian Republicans would have be included
                                Indonesian representation either as separate group or with others,
                                but that no white man should be on Indonesian delegation. He added
                                he had contacted local Indonesian Republican representatives who
                                will accept immediately if invited.</p>

                            <p>As will be gathered from above, Quirino displayed considerable
                                resentment toward US in course discussion. At one point he
                                specifically asked why Secretary had made statements discouraging
                                attempts form Pacific Union. I replied that Secretary of State’s

                                July 14. Chinese Minister Chen Chih-ping called on me July 15 for
                                apparent purposes, attempting learn our reactions proposal for
                                Pacific Pact and advance arguments in favor US support therefor. In
                                course conversation he confirmed much of information supplied
                                reference telegrams and asserted China, Philippines and Korea
                                determined go ahead with union even if no other states join it. He
                                stated that these three states want US leadership but suggested that
                                leadership might go elsewhere by default; he remarked Great Britain
                                has its sphere of influence in the Pacific and queried whether US
                                willing stand aside while Britain assumes leadership. (I judge this
                                line was agreed in advance as President Quirino made remark
                                yesterday about British leading and aiding members [of] pro-British
                                bloc though he presented it in manner which was not very
                                meaningful.) Chen added that he hoped US would give Pacific Union at
                                least moral support and stated any US recognition of Chinese
                                Communist regime would deal a fatal blow to morale [of] members such
                                union including, of course, China.</p>

                                attitude toward proposed union was based on statement Acheson and

                            <p>Apart from 1948 Chinese semi-official suggestions for an
                                anti-Communist alliance among China, Korea and Japan, the Pacific
                                Pact concept appears to have been originally an instinctive “me too”
                                reaction to announcement of the North Atlantic Treaty. Individual
                                countries and leaders have then developed ideas about the nature of
                                such a pact in terms of their own situations and pressing needs,
                                with US moral and/or material support in each case being assumed as
                                the eventual cornerstone of the structure.</p>
                            <pb n="1161" xml:id="pg_1161" facs="0575"/>
                            <p>Korea, fearful of attack from Communist-dominated north Korea and
                                seeking arms and a US military guarantee of its frontiers, has been
                                most vociferous in advocating a pact with US participation. Direct
                                appeals for large supplies of arms and a US military commitment
                                having failed, Rhee is heartily endorsing the Chiang–Quirino move,
                                presumably hoping to attain his goals indirectly.</p>
                            <p>Similarly Chiang Kai-shek doubtless discounts the possibility of his
                                being able to secure a US military commitment and large supplies of
                                arms directly. Like Rhee he probably believes the Philippines and
                                other states in the proposed Pacific Union might be utilized as
                                instruments to bring further pressure on the US for aid, most of
                                which might be expected to accrue to China at present. Chiang and
                                Rhee apparently desire that Quirino take the lead in “pulling their
                                chestnuts from the fire”, and Quirino seems to have responded to
                                their flattery.</p>
                            <p>The views of the Philippine (and Australian) leaders are obviously
                                colored by the domestic political requirements of imminent national
                                elections. There is every indication Quirino has fallen in with
                                Chiang’s (and Rhee’s) flattering suggestion that he take the lead,
                                not only from genuine concern for Philippine security, but because
                                his emergence as an Asian leader would improve his political
                                prospects, and because of resentment of real or fancied slights by
                                the US. Romulo’s shrewd memorandum apparently reached him after he
                                had made a commitment to Chiang. Romulo has advised us he has since
                                told Quirino the maneuver was a blunder. According to Romulo,
                                Quirino has responded by saying he wants Romulo to return, repair
                                the damage and bail him out.</p>
                            <p>Determined opposition to the maintenance of “European imperialism”
                                may be expected to emerge as an important factor in the attitudes of
                                India, Indonesia, the Philippines and perhaps other countries, as
                                Romulo points out.</p>
                            <p>Concern for their security in any global conflict is apparent in the
                                attitudes of Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. Concern
                                for immediate military assistance predominates with Rhee and
                                Chiang.</p>
                            <p>Secretary Acheson’s May 18 statement caused sharp changes in approach
                                in most countries. Australia and New Zealand emphasized that
                                consultation and planning was all they envisaged at present,
                                acknowledging that the North Atlantic Treaty took precedence.
                                Filipino and Korean spokesmen began to stress that Asian nations
                                must take the lead and organize on their own. Quirino and Romulo
                                began to define the union they had in mind as being political,
                                economic and cultural in nature, at least at first, where previously
                                they had let it be assumed the mere words “Pacific Pact” meant
                                primarily military alliance. Chinese newspapers and spokesmen simply
                                decried America’s “short-sighted” neglect of the problem of stopping
                                Communism in Asia. The UK welcomed the US statement.</p>
                            <pb n="1162" xml:id="pg_1162" facs="0576"/>
                            <p>In effect Chiang and Rhee have succeeded in getting Quirino committed
                                to a Pacific Union with themselves as charter members. Their
                                inclusion will vitally affect the nature and aims of the proposed
                                union. Chinese Nationalist membership saddles the union from the
                                start with an almost hopeless cause and makes it more difficult for
                                the US and possibly other western powers to give their support. It
                                may also be expected to alienate other south Asian countries,
                                particularly India. Thus the charter membership roster may be
                                expected to inhibit the development of any alternative structure for
                                a viable Asian union or association of non-Communist states, since
                                India is essential to such a grouping.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft">
                                <hi rend="italic">Suggestions</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>The U.S. would welcome the development of an effective association of
                                non-Communist countries in south and east Asia, which might develop
                                into an active anti-Communist front. The January New Delhi
                                conference and the Chiang–Quirino meeting are evidence that steps
                                toward Asiatic cooperation will be taken with or without our support
                                or advice. The Chiang–Quirino meeting suggests that a primary aim of
                                this movement is to force our hand.</p>
                            <p>The Chiang–Quirino–Rhee basis for a Pacific Union does not seem to be
                                the beginning of an effective structure, since Chiang’s inclusion
                                saddles the embryonic union with a military problem it cannot hope
                                to solve, and will probably repel other countries essential to an
                                effective association of non-Communist countries. The present
                                maneuver, if it crystallizes, may well split Asian countries into
                                non-Communist and anti-Communist segments, increasing the problems
                                of Australia, New Zealand and the western powers.</p>
                            <p>Two more promising approaches to the problem have already been made
                                by Asians: 1) Nehru’s somewhat vague suggestions for an Asian Union,
                                and 2) Romulo’s specific suggestions to Quirino in his telegraphed
                                memorandum of July 7 (Tab “A”).<note n="1" xml:id="d338fn1">See

                                    posts abroad on July 22, 8:25 a. m., for the information of
                                    mission chiefs.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>Quirino has summoned Romulo to Manila, reportedly to help work out
                                the details, to contact other countries and to make arrangements for
                                the next formal conference which would presumably crystallize the
                                proposed union. Romulo does not propose China as a charter member.
                                These circumstances indicate there may be opportunity and time for
                                intensive diplomatic and propaganda activity designed to help
                                Quirino overcome what Romulo calls his “blunder”. Our objective
                                would seem to be to wean Quirino from the Chiang plan and influence
                                him to espouse the “Philippine Plan” as outlined by Romulo. If
                                Quirino would prolong the interval of diplomatic discussion and
                                preparation before the second general conference, politely stalling
                                Chiang, the problem <pb n="1163" xml:id="pg_1163" facs="0577"/>of
                                China’s membership might resolve itself. It is possible that within
                                a few months Nationalist China will either prove itself viable as a
                                re-vitalized and able segment of China able to carry on resistance
                                as a worthy partner in the enterprise, or will be so clearly doomed
                                that the other necessary member countries will avoid entering a
                                hopeless alliance. Publication of the White Paper will probably
                                affect this aspect of the problem.</p>
                            <p>We have several useful avenues to Quirino: the Embassy, with
                                Ambassador Cowen<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">Myron M. Cowen, in
                                    Washington from Manila.</note> soon to return; Romulo himself,
                                due to return next week; and Consul General Abbott<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d338fn3">George M. Abbott.</note> in Saigon, a personal
                                friend of Quirino who is going to Manila within a few days and
                                expects to call on Quirino. The first step would appear to be to
                                persuade Romulo to tell Quirino he has shown us his July 7
                                memorandum, and to report we had reacted most favorably. We should
                                immediately send the full text of this memorandum to New Delhi and
                                other key points. (Infotel outlining it already sent.<note n="4"

                            <p>Supplementary activity with Nehru, with the UK, the Netherlands,
                                France, Korea, Australia and New Zealand would seem indicated. We
                                should make it clear to all that we consider that the development of
                                healthy and increasing economic and political ties between
                                non-Communist countries in the area essential to the growth of a
                                strong community of independent Asian and Pacific nations; that such
                                an association of Asian and Pacific nations offers the best means of
                                protecting and advancing the interests of individual Asian and
                                Pacific countries; that settlements in Indonesia and Indochina are
                                essential first steps; that increased, mutually beneficial trade
                                within the area, resulting from taking full advantage of the
                                potentials of Japanese and Indian industry and the productive
                                resources of the other countries, is another; and that in our view
                                the movement and any structure which might be evolved must have
                                inherent strength in Asia, and not appear to be an instrument
                                designed primarily to extract and channel U.S. or other western
                                aid.</p>
                            <p>As Romulo suggests, Nehru is the key. We should be most adroit.
                                Perhaps we should not broach the subject to him at all, leaving that
                                to Romulo and Quirino, but remaining ready to respond to any
                                inquiries in the sense of the paragraph immediately above.</p>
                            <p>Our public information and propaganda policy will be most important.
                                To avoid the “kiss of death” effect, it might prove best for us
                                publicly to maintain our present public coolness to the whole idea,
                                creating the impression of an Asiatic development real and hardy
                                enough to start and grow despite our obtuse aloofness. Romulo, Nehru
                                and Quirino might prefer this. On the other hand, or at the same
                                time, <pb n="1164" xml:id="pg_1164" facs="0578"/>we might well
                                emphasize our interest in contributory developments, such as
                                outlined above, without mentioning them as contributory toward a
                                union.</p>
                            <p>Adroitly handled, we might find this whole development an added
                                instrument of pressure for accomplishment of our specific aims in
                                Indonesia, Indochina, Japanese-Asian trade, etc.</p>

                                <p>826 Secret. Having read excerpts from your recent address in the
                                        <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> advocating Pacific
                                    Union, I wish to submit the following memorandum for your
                                    consideration:</p>
                                <p>The time has come when the people of Asia should begin taking
                                    steps in their own defense. It is obvious that the present
                                    American administration will give no support to those resisting
                                    Communism in China until the Chinese show some aptitude for that
                                    task. As in Iran in 1946, so in China in 1948: “No assistance
                                    without resistance.” Until now, the various independent
                                    governments of Eastern Asia have been concentrating on the need
                                    of eliminating the remnants of European imperialism in our area
                                    rather than in stopping the growing Communistic imperialism of
                                    the Soviet Union.</p>
                                <p>It is said that since the United States, which alone could
                                    provide the military force to stop the Communists, is not now
                                    disposed to do that in Asia, nothing at all can be done. I do
                                    not share this view. I believe that in the next six months,
                                    during which it will probably become apparent how much
                                    resistance to Communism free China can provide, the free states
                                    of Southeast Asia could profitably take the following steps: <list>
                                        <label>(1)</label>
                                        <item>Korea, the Philippines, Siam, New Zealand, Australia,
                                            India, Burma, Ceylon and Indonesia should organize
                                            themselves into a political and economic union. The
                                            purposes of this union should be public and its
                                            formation should be an act of solidarity against any
                                            encroachment on the freedom and independence of the
                                            signatory governments. It should be aimed at the
                                            Russo-Ohinese Communists while at the same time
                                            repudiating the maintenance of European imperialism. For
                                            this latter reason, it would seem, at least in the first
                                            stage, that Britain, France, the Netherlands as well as
                                            the United States should be excluded from the
                                            pact.</item>
                                        <label>(2)</label>
                                        <item>Once the union is proclaimed, the same governments
                                            could make a common offer of economic cooperation with
                                            the United States under the Truman Point-Four program.
                                            The United States Government <pb n="1165"
                                                xml:id="pg_1165" facs="0579"/>might be asked to send
                                            to that area an economic mission headed by a
                                            well-informed government official but including two or
                                            three outstanding American industrialists.</item>
                                    </list>
                                </p>
                                <p>These two steps taken would, I think, change the political
                                    climate in all Eastern Asia. They would help destroy the notion
                                    that Communism is in any sense the “wave of the future” which
                                    must be accepted passively. They would show that the objections
                                    to Chinese Communism will by no means be an exclusive American
                                    worry or a stratagem of the European colonial powers.</p>
                                <p>Finally, within perhaps a year after it had become apparent that
                                    there was some chance of limiting the spread of Communism from
                                    China to the rest of Southeast Asia by force, the nations
                                    signatory to the union could then consider whether it is to
                                    their best interests to appeal collectively to the United States
                                    for military assistance. It is possible that assistance might,
                                    in the meanwhile, have been given to the Chinese resistance
                                    group provided they show willingness and capacity to use it
                                    effectively.</p>
                                <p>Tentative moves have been made by the British Commonwealth
                                    members in the region to establish a security organization among
                                    themselves. Economically they are already bound together by
                                    imperial preference. Obviously this smaller unit must give way
                                    to a larger one if the idea of regional union is to prevail.</p>
                                <p>It is equally obvious that no such Asian group could get very far
                                    without the full support of the government of India. Recent
                                    internal political developments in India may have started to
                                    shake Nehru’s former belief that India can by herself alone
                                    stand as a third force between the United States and Russia.
                                    Therefore, before any step is taken to form this union, I would
                                    recommend that you take up directly the whole question with
                                    Nehru as soon as possible and discuss all its implications.</p>
                                <p>Such concrete action on your part would remove the question from
                                    the realm of wishful thinking and pure speculation. It would
                                    prove to the United States that an important development is
                                    afoot in Asia that it could not ignore, and your hand would be
                                    strengthened when you come to Washington as reported in the
                                    press and of which so far I have no official knowledge.</p>

                                <p>The Chiang–Quirino talks looking toward an anti-Communist Pacific
                                    front invite the good wishes though not the jubilant
                                    expectations of Americans. Any degree of understanding between
                                    anti-Communist <pb n="1166" xml:id="pg_1166" facs="0580"
                                    />elements in Asia is to be welcomed, though it must be
                                    carefully evaluated as a bid for American military support.</p>
                                <p>There has been much talk of a Pacific pact to match the Atlantic
                                    defense treaty. It may be thought that an agreement between the
                                    Philippines and the Chinese Nationalists, with the probable
                                    addition of South Korea, could serve as the nucleus of a larger
                                    international agreement. Yet it is improbable that a Pacific
                                    pact will develop in just this way.</p>
                                <p>The forthcoming White Paper on China which is being prepared in
                                    Washington should make clear why most students of the Far East
                                    put little faith in the “retired” president of Nationalist China
                                    as the leader of a new and enlarged crusade against communism.
                                    The reasons which have argued against America’s underwriting of
                                    further military misadventures by the Nationalists are unlikely
                                    to be altered appreciably by any agreement Generalissimo Chiang
                                    may reach with Presidents Quirino and Rhee.</p>
                                <p>Other elements of more importance to a Pacific pact than the
                                    Chiang rump regime are a final Dutch–Indonesian agreement, the
                                    integration of Japanese economic recovery with Asian development
                                    as a whole, the continental leadership of Prime Minister Nehru
                                    and the effective cooperation of India with other members of the
                                    British Commonwealth, the economic strengthening of South Korea
                                    and the Philippines. So far as American policy can forward these
                                    ends, it should bend every effort to do so.</p>

                                alliance or mutual assistance, he said. Also must have American
                                support and hoped America good will toward Philippines and China and
                                own considerations South Korea would have desired effect on American

                                    <p>“At the invitation of His Excellency, President Elpidio
                                        Quirino of the Republic of the Philippines, Generalissimo
                                        Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang, paid a visit to
                                        Baguio on July 10th for an exchange of views on matters
                                        concerning Sino-Philippmes relations and the general
                                        situation in the Far East. As a result of this exchange of
                                        views, a joint statement was issued on July 11th.</p>
                                    <p>“The joint statement, apart from affirming the desirability
                                        of closer economic and cultural cooperation between China
                                        and the Philippines, proposed the immediate formation of a
                                        union of Far Eastern countries for the purpose of achieving
                                        solidarity and mutual assistance to contain and counteract
                                        the spread of Communist menace in the world and particularly
                                        in Asia.</p>

                                        had the support of the representatives of the Social
                                        Democratic and Young China Parties, is of the opinion that
                                        the proposed union of the Far Eastern countries is consonant
                                        with the needs of both the current general situation in the
                                        Far East and the particular conditions prevailing in
                                        China.</p>

                            <p>292. Immediately on return from Baguio via Tainan, K. C. Wu, who was
                                one of four advisers, called on me [to] “give me the whole story”.
                                Seemed worried over some public reactions. Said conference was part
                                of overall effort to emphasize solidarity in and out of China in
                                preparation for further disasters, including loss of Canton. Was not
                                primarily attempt to influence Congress and US public opinion.
                                Generalissimo currently intent on self-help, which advisers trying
                                to temper with realization of need for eventual US aid while
                                supporting initial self-help moves. Wu described China, PI,<note
                                    n="1" xml:id="d341fn1">Republic of the Philippines.</note> and
                                South Korea as Far East orphans as result State Department inaction
                                but still in US camp and hoping for better treatment.</p>
                            <p>At Baguio Chinese agreed to approach Siam, PI to approach Indonesia
                                to join union. Burma, India, New Zealand, and Australia will not be
                                approached for time being since they are in British camp; British
                                have separate two-sided policy and approach now might annoy London.
                                Chinese fear that British if crossed may try to influence US against
                                Nationalist Government. As for French Indochina must await
                                determination of Bao<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">Bao Dal, Chief of

                                MacArthur which means US; so no action will be taken there.</p>
                            <p>Chinese wanted title Far East Union but PI committed to Pacific
                                Union. Formal charter will be drafted at early three-party
                                conference using Atlantic Pact, etc., as guides.</p>

                                preparatory stages discussions proposed Pacific Union will be
                                restricted to China, Philippines, Korea. Now that political decision
                                has been taken, implementation will be handled through normal
                                diplomatic channels. Generalissimo hopes eventually secure
                                participation Siam, Burma, Indochina, and Indonesia. He excludes
                                India, Pakistan and Australia, saying they are members of British
                                Commonwealth and have their own anti-Communist measures. He
                                dismisses Japan because of its special status, but admits trade with
                                Japan will be important element in program. I suggested, and he did
                                not deny, that program envisaged cooperation in cultural and
                                economic as well as military fields.</p>

                                the matter of the recent talks between the Generalissimo and
                                Quirino. He referred to the joint release which was made at the
                                conclusion of the talks in Baguio and stated that the Chinese
                                Government was anxious to have the moral support and sympathy of the
                                U.S. Government for the objectives and aims expressed by Chiang and
                                Quirino.</p>
                            <p>In response I referred to the Secretary’s statements to the press
                                with regard to the Baguio conference at which time he indicated that
                                the U.S. Government was not unsympathetic toward the desires of
                                nations in the Far East to align themselves against the spread of
                                Communism. I pointed out, however, with regard to the conclusion of
                                a “Pacific Pact” along the lines of the Atlantic Pact, that the
                                Secretary had stated that his views on this subject remained as he
                                had indicated on May 18, namely, that the time was not appropriate
                                for the conclusion of such a pact among the nations of the Far
                                East.</p>

                                Quirino re next step in what Yeh prefers call “Far Eastern Union”.
                                Decision has not yet been reached as to whether original

                                that thought is predominant anti-Communist pact covering political
                                and economic phases. Mutual military aid might come later. He
                                wondered this connection whether Philippines had surplus war stocks
                                which might some way become available.</p>
                            <p>Yeh says Chinese have word that British Commonwealth nations in Far

                                Commonwealth anti-Communist pact which would include India,
                                Pakistan, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand. This is among reasons
                                he prefers restricting original signers proposed Far Eastern
                                pact.</p>

                                    >Dept</gloss> suggests you refer to Secy’s May 18 statement on
                                Pacific Pact (wireless bulletin May 18 no. SX-B-A) which on July 13

                            <p>Re Secy’s statement that Atlantic Pact of lengthy evolution you might
                                point out inherent differences between Atlantic and Pacific
                                communities, particularly that Atlantic community is stable one
                                whereas Pacific community comprises areas torn by internal strife
                                and until this strife is settled such areas may well be inordinate
                                drain on more stable Asiatic partners in such union. Consequently
                                time does not appear ripe for Pacific Union similar in character to
                                Atlantic Pact. Foregoing not indication US Govt wld be unsympathetic
                                to spontaneous moves toward a voluntary association of non-commie
                                states in Pacific area through which polit aims and economies of
                                those states cld be correlated to serve their mutual interests.</p>
                            <p>You will appreciate that while <gloss target="#t_Dept1">Dept</gloss>
                                wld welcome such an association it has had to consider whether or
                                not the Chiang–Quirino proposal in its present form gives any
                                promise of success (see first para Depcirtel, Jul 20). Also any
                                indication US actively endorses such a union or suggests an
                                alternative is likely to be distorted or misinterpreted as US
                                initiative, which wld jeopardize any chance of its success. In other
                                words the association shld be purely Asiatic development created by
                                Asiatic initiative, and if Thai Govt in course discussion suggests
                                alternative to Chiang–Quirino proposal you will find views expressed
                                in penultimate para Depcirtel, Jul 20 of possible use.</p>
                            <p>Altho US constrained reserve its position at this time with respect
                                Chiang–Quirino proposal you will no doubt find opportunity during

                            <p>955. At weekly press conference with Korea reporters July 29
                                President Rhee was asked following questions: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It is generally admitted that without US aid the Pacific
                                        Pact cannot become effective and will exist as nothing more
                                        than a political gesture. A foreign despatch indicated that
                                        there was a radical difference in the opinions of President
                                        Quirino and Mr. Romulo regarding the Pact. Does not Mr.
                                        Romulo’s opinion reflect the United States opinion that the
                                        conclusion of the Pacific Pact is premature.”</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Rhee replied as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Since the time of President George Washington the US has
                                        adhered to a policy of isolation. Recently the US has given
                                        up that policy in order to keep abreast of the changing
                                        world situation. Rather because of the influence of the
                                        previous isolation policy some Americans still might object
                                        to the conclusion of any international treaty. At any rate,
                                        so far as I know, the US will not oppose the conclusion of
                                        any anti-Communistic alliance in the Far East. In principle
                                        there is no reason why the Pacific Pact may not be
                                        concluded. If there are any who oppose it, I dare say it is
                                        because they do not understand the world situation. It is
                                        reported that Ambassador at Large Philip Jessup was ordered
                                        by the Department of State to organize a committee to study
                                        the US policy of the Far East.<note n="1" xml:id="d356fn1"

                                            established more or less on July 19 at Washington in a
                                            conference between the Secretary of State, the Director

                                            President Quirino was entirely clear on this point but
                                            that he was scheduled to speak with him at eight o’clock

                            <p>1678. We fully concur with Department infotel July 20 re
                                Chiang–Quirino proposal for Pacific Union that Nationalist China in
                                its present stage of defeat is a liability to proposed union.</p>
                            <p>We note some discrepancy between Soviet and CCP<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d359fn1">Chinese Communist Party.</note> reactions to
                                proposed union. According to Moscow telegram 1818, July 22 to
                                Department, Soviets view it with certain measure of glee because it
                                would be inherently weak, because it would be so vulnerable to their
                                propaganda in Asia and because it might widen divisions between
                                American and British policies in southeast Asia. Presumably Soviets
                                might also welcome it as method of diverting Anglo-American
                                resistance against them in all-important arena of Western
                                Europe.</p>
                            <p>CCP on other hand seems to take more serious view of proposed union
                                (according to New China News Agency commentary of July 18, CCP
                                considers that “this criminal act not only aims at opposing Chinese
                                people, but also aims at opposing peoples in Philippines, Korea and
                                other Far Eastern countries.”) In other words, CCP views <pb
                                    n="1181" xml:id="pg_1181" facs="0595"/>proposed union as
                                directed against itself rather than Soviet imperialism.</p>
                            <p>Despite community of interests between CCP and USSR, it is only
                                natural that two should view proposed union somewhat differently,
                                for it would be in front yard of one and backyard of other,
                                respectively. Contradictions between basic national interests of
                                Communist China and USSR tend to increase this disparity.</p>
                            <p>We therefore suggest that proposed union might also be analyzed as
                                respects extent to which it would be instrument of Nationalist
                                Government to contain CCP power and extent to which it would be
                                instrument of all participating nations to contain Soviet power.</p>

                                imminent arrival Chiang, I called on President Rhee late yesterday
                                and discussed with him four points set forth <gloss
                                    target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 633, July 29. I also conveyed
                                to him in general way pertinent portions Depcirtel July 20,
                                stressing that we consider development healthy economic political
                                ties between non-Communist countries in Pacific area essential to
                                growth strong associated Asian-Pacific nations, offering means
                                protecting individual countries concerned.</p>
                            <p>2. Rhee explained it his idea to establish pact among East Asiatic
                                countries based on broad principles similar those of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NAP1">NAP</gloss>; primary purpose of pact would be
                                to oppose Communist aggression. He expressed view if East Asiatic
                                countries could consummate such a pact, US Government would not
                                object and would eventually support it.</p>
                            <p>3. Rhee stated he understood US position regarding Nationalist China;
                                that he would exercise care in conversations with Chiang; that he
                                would not commit himself to narrow pact with Philippines and
                                Nationalist China but would seek one of wider character; and that he
                                would inform me of his discussions with Chiang.</p>
                            <p>4. I gather from Rhee that he will not enter into any hard and fast
                                commitments as result of talks with Chiang. In all probability
                                conversations will not get beyond exploratory stage.</p>
                            <p>5. President and Mrs. Rhee left by plane this morning for Chinhae
                                where talks with Chiang will be held. Rhee told me he was informed
                                only yesterday afternoon of Chiang’s expected arrival today. He
                                immediately <pb n="1182" xml:id="pg_1182" facs="0596"/>requested
                                Sino Ambassador telegraph Chiang, requesting he delay arrival for
                                day or two so adequate preparations could be made. It unknown
                                whether Sino Ambassador’s message will have reached Chiang in time
                                delay departure. If not, Chiang may arrive Korea today. Otherwise,
                                it appears he will arrive 5th. Meantime, an advance party of Chinese
                                from Formosa arrived in C–47 at Kimpo airport late yesterday.</p>

                                    <p>“We are strongly of the opinion that countries of the Pacific
                                        in general, and Far Eastern countries in particular, are
                                        facing a greater danger from international Communism today
                                        than any other part of the world. Solidarity and concerted
                                        action among these countries is more urgently needed than
                                        elsewhere. It is our firm belief that the world cannot be
                                        free if Asia is to go under, and mankind cannot afford to be
                                        divided into half free men and half slave.</p>
                                    <p>“Basing on the above considerations, we have arrived at full
                                        agreement concerning the idea of a union as conceived in the
                                        joint statement issued by President Quirino of the
                                        Philippines and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on 12 July,
                                        1949 at Baguio.</p>
                                    <p>“We both agreed further that the President of the Philippines
                                        should be requested to take all necessary steps to bring
                                        about the birth of the proposed union. For this purpose we
                                        are asking President Quirino to convene in the immediate
                                        future at Baguio a preliminary conference to devise concrete
                                        measures for its organization.”</p>

                            <p>1016. In conversation with Rhee yesterday afternoon, I asked his
                                impressions of Chinhae conversation. He stated they [the Chinese?]
                                were “somewhat disappointed but they understood” Korean desire not
                                to enter into exclusive pact with Chinese and Filipinos. Rhee stated
                                he had proposed and <gloss target="#t_Gimo1">Gimo</gloss> had agreed
                                that Quirino should take initiative in calling conference of
                                like-minded Pacific powers. Rhee stated following Chinhae conference
                                he and <gloss target="#t_Gimo1">Gimo</gloss> had sent joint message
                                to Quirino in Washington<note n="1" xml:id="d367fn1">See final

                                been received. Rhee indicated that in initial stages at least
                                proposed Pacific Union would not be expected to include either
                                “British bloc or US”. He indicated that India would be welcome to
                                join but he felt that Nehru’s attitude is negative.</p>

                                and Korea will receive American assistance after which China will be

                            <p>In connection with formation of Southeast Asia Union of which as you
                                know President Quirino has placed me in charge, may I ask you to
                                note that I have endeavored to form, through the President’s letter
                                of instruction to me, concept of the proposed union in line with my
                                conversations with you in Washington prior to my departure for
                                Manila. In accordance with the President’s instructions I have
                                succeeded in obtaining the support of all the political parties in
                                the country for the calling of a conference in Baguio in order to
                                organize a Southeast Asia Union without military commitments,
                                dedicated to the promotion of the common political, economic and
                                cultural interests of the member states.</p>
                            <p>I am now engaged in sounding out the reaction of the governments of
                                India, Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, Burma, Pakistan and Siam
                                towards this proposal. It is obvious that the replies of most of
                                these countries would greatly depend upon the attitude towards such
                                a <pb n="1187" xml:id="pg_1187" facs="0601"/>union of the major
                                powers concerned in the area, Regarding therefore this aspect of our
                                proposal, I would like to know whether I could give some indication
                                to the invited countries of the US attitude towards the proposed
                                union to the following effect: that the US Government, while not in
                                a position at this time to take active part in the formation of the
                                proposed union, regards with sympathy the efforts of the free
                                countries of Southeast Asia to cooperate more closely with one
                                another in promoting their common interests. In addition, I believe
                                that the State Department itself might give some indication of its
                                attitude directly to the envoys of the interested countries in
                                Washington the better to facilitate their agreement to the principle
                                underlying the Philippine proposal. I should be grateful to receive
                                some assurance that we could adopt such a two-pronged approach to
                                this aspect of the problem in order that the interested countries
                                may consider the proposal of the Philippine Government with the
                                necessary degree of confidence and self-assurance. Thanks and
                                regards. Ambassador Romulo”.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Corner<note n="1" xml:id="d371fn1">Frank H. Corner, First
                                    Secretary of the New Zealand Embassy.</note> stated during the
                                course of a general conversation on Far Eastern matters that his
                                government had received a telegram from General Romulo inviting it
                                to take part with other like-minded governments in a conference at
                                some unspecified date in the future concerning possibilities of a
                                regional pact among Pacific powers. According to Mr. Corner, General
                                Romulo’s telegram quoted extensively from the letter of President
                                Quirino to General Romulo and also attempted to divorce this
                                approach from the recent Chiang–Quirino talks and tie it up with the
                                New Delhi conference of last January. General Romulo’s telegram made
                                clear that the pact envisioned by him would be primarily economic
                                and cultural and that it would have no military commitments. The New
                                Zealand Government, according to Mr. Corner, had replied to General
                                Romulo stating that it would give the matter serious study but that
                                before reaching a decision as to whether or not it would be willing
                                to participate in a conference on this subject it would like to have
                                General Romulo inform it as to the attitude of such powers as the
                                United States and the United Kingdom without the cooperation of
                                which, in the opinion of the New Zealand Government, any Pacific
                                Pact would appear to be meaningless. Mr. Corner went on at some
                                length to explain the New Zealand position. <pb n="1188"
                                    xml:id="pg_1188" facs="0602"/>According to him the New Zealand
                                Government does not look upon itself as an Asiatic government but
                                rather as an extension into the southern Pacific of Western Europe.
                                The New Zealand Government has been somewhat disturbed at the
                                possibility that the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact might leave New
                                Zealand neglected by its Western friends and associates and it does
                                not feel that a Pacific Pact made up of only the nations of
                                Southeast Asia and India would be a suitable substitute. Mr. Corner
                                frankly said that the New Zealand Government feels that if it aligns
                                itself in a pact with only Asiatic nations there would be the danger
                                of certain of these nations’ coming to look at the comparative
                                wealth of New Zealand and its comparative under-population with
                                covetous eyes. According to Mr. Corner, the New Zealand Government
                                realizes that it might not be possible for the United States to
                                enter a formal security pact in the Pacific at this time and it does
                                not believe that this is necessary but it does think that a general
                                understanding among New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and
                                the United States regarding security in the Pacific would be a most
                                desirable thing. I informed Mr. Corner that this Government’s
                                attitude toward a Pacific Pact had been made clear in various
                                statements by the Secretary and that our attitude toward the
                                Philippine initiative had been expressed in the last sentence of the
                                joint communiqué issued upon the departure of President
                                    Quirino.<note n="2" xml:id="d371fn2">For White House press

                            <p>In the course of a conversation the Thai Ambassador referred to a
                                proposal made by the Philippine Government that Thailand participate
                                in a conference looking toward the possible formation of a Pacific
                                Union including other like-minded nations which might desire to
                                cooperate in opposing communism. The Ambassador said that his
                                Government had accepted the invitation to participate in the
                                conference and that he had been instructed to inquire what the
                                Department’s views were on the question of a Pacific Union.</p>
                            <pb n="1189" xml:id="pg_1189" facs="0603"/>
                            <p>I said that I regretted I could give him no authoritative comment at
                                this time as the many factors involved were still under
                                consideration. However, I could recall to his attention the
                                Secretary’s press statement of May 18 regarding a possible Pacific
                                Pact, which had been reiterated on several subsequent occasions, and
                                to the final sentence of the joint communiqué issued by the
                                President and President Quirino.</p>
                            <p>I added that speaking personally I believed that a voluntary union of
                                the non-communist states of the Pacific area, for the purposes
                                recently publicized by General Romulo—economic and cultural
                                cooperation—could not but be mutually beneficial to all the
                                participants. Such a union by the development of common interests in
                                cultural, economic and social matters could become a potent force in
                                the building up of a strong Far Eastern community.</p>
                            <p>I said that I hoped to be able to give him further information in
                                this respect in the not too distant future.</p>

                                August 22 (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 996, August
                                19). While appreciative of contents, Modulo expounded at length on
                                theme that <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> union will die unborn
                                unless State Department is willing, if asked by representatives of

                                Britain, to indicate that US approves project. He explained he
                                conceives union as instrument assist US in struggle with advancing
                                Commie power this part of world and that if US evinces lack interest
                                nobody in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> will have necessary
                                confidence in union’s future.</p>

                            <p>I suggested that struggle against aggressive Communism is fight of
                                nations <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> no less than of US and
                                reemphasized importance indigenous motivation and effort if <gloss

                                While agreeing Romulo continually reverted his original theme. I
                                therefore stated we would convey his ideas to Department prior his
                                return Washington in order that officers with whom he wishes further
                                discuss his plans for <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> union may
                                be apprised in advance of his views.</p>
                            <p>Romulo appears to be only one who has any influence with Quirino on
                                foreign affairs. I consider that he is completely sincere and is
                                making every effort to straighten out situation here in accordance
                                with his conversations with Department and to steer Quirino’s
                                thinking along sound lines. I accordingly would greatly appreciate
                                anything that Department can do to assist him.</p>

                                I would gather that the U.S. does not consider itself party to the
                                region of which the Philippine Islands are a part; that the U.S. is
                                sympathetic to a regional approach based on “indigenous incentive
                                and momentum developed in countries concerned”; but that the U.S.
                                wishes to remain aloof for two reasons: <list>

                                        the proposed association and the U.S. being an “outside
                                        power” would only distract and mislead nations seeking to

                            <p>It seems to me that the U.S. cannot, and indeed must not, avoid an
                                active part in any Pacific or Asiatic association of nations or
                                peoples primarily for two reasons: <list>

                                        Asia; and because the security of the U.S. is involved we
                                        cannot remain aloof.</item>

                                    <item>It would hardly be in our best interest, or that of the
                                        Asiatic peoples themselves, to have a solely Asiatic
                                        association develop. After all, the great political danger
                                        to be avoided is the sort of association which is best
                                        described by such terms as “Asia for the Asiatics” or the
                                        “Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere”.</item>

                            </p>
                            <p>It seems to me that we should either oppose an association of nations
                                and peoples in Asia and the Pacific or we should encourage and
                                participate in such an association. The question of timing, the
                                degree of participation and the manner of assertion of leadership
                                and direction are all tactical matters to be handled in a manner
                                best designed to accomplish our policy decisions and need not, if
                                skillfully done, have the unfortunate repercussions suggested in the
                                attached message.</p>
                            <p>The “Pan-American Union” would not be the powerful instrument for
                                good that it is if it were the “Latin-American Union”. If a “Pacific
                                Union” becomes an “Asiatic Association” either because we shirk our
                                position of power and leadership or because they become convinced we
                                have abandoned Asia through timidity or neglect, we, I believe,
                                shall have lost a great opportunity and a step will be taken in
                                separating Orient from Occident.</p>
                            <p>It seems to me that before we drift into a position we should decide
                                either to oppose or to support a “Pacific Union” and should then
                                develop a program of action and adopt an attitude based on that
                                basic policy decision.</p>
                            <p>I need hardly add that for my money we should support and lead the
                                Asiatics in their movement toward association with one another and
                                with us. It need not cost us more than the Pan-American grouping
                                costs us and could return as much or more.</p>

                            <p>2062. At President Quirino’s request I called on him at Baguio August
                                27. Romulo was present during interview and Quirino touched on
                                question <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> union. I took
                                opportunity remark that Nehru would be visiting US during October
                                and that I hoped Philippine Government would avoid action which
                                might give rise to speculation that his visit connected with
                                proposed union. I particularly alluded proposed meeting
                                representative <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> countries Baguio
                                and said I hoped it would not occur till date sufficiently after
                                Nehru’s visit to ensure that two events would not appear connected.
                                Quirino and Romulo agreed. Former stated Romulo would continue be
                                responsible for sounding <pb n="1193" xml:id="pg_1193" facs="0607"
                                />out prospective members and developing plans for union and latter
                                stated he believed Baguio meeting could not in any case be held
                                before November and might not be possible before early months 1950.
                                Quirino also alluded Romulo’s expected departure for US afternoon
                                August 27 and stated he wants Romulo keep in touch with State
                                Department and work closely with its representatives.</p>
                            <p>After conclusion our talks with Quirino, I asked Romulo what sort of
                                structure he has in mind for <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                                Union and what he believes can be accomplished through Union. He
                                replied he does not anticipate that it will have any secretariat or
                                other structure which would remain in being between meetings. He
                                said union could accomplish following: <list>

                            <p>The situation in the Far East is serious. It threatens the interests
                                of the United States. An element in the situation is the belief in
                                Asia and among many people in the United States that the Communists
                                (USSR) have taken from us the initiative. This belief is a fact of
                                political importance. It must be acknowledged privately and
                                countered openly.</p>
                            <pb n="1194" xml:id="pg_1194" facs="0608"/>
                            <p>We do not believe that the counters are primarily either arms or
                                money. They are rather those used in psychological warfare. The
                                technique is similar to that used in advertising. It is less
                                necessary to convince the intellect than to appeal to the
                                imagination.</p>
                            <p>The first necessity is therefore to find actions which contain
                                dramatic elements. They must be chosen in relation to sound concepts
                                of political strategy but, if not antagonistic to such concepts,
                                their psychological or propaganda value would in itself be
                                sufficient justification for their adoption.</p>
                            <p>The following steps are recommended as meeting these requirements: <list>

                            <p>2. I am glad note Department prepared consider giving some support
                                such conference since we feel here any effort, even though
                                faltering, on the part SE Asian countries get together at this
                                critical juncture is of decided value, and should at least receive
                                our quiet encouragement. However, with view avoiding confusion and

                                Irritation between Philippine and Thai Governments over conference,
                                I would like suggest Department through Embassy Manila ascertain
                                whether President Quirino definitely intends go ahead plans for
                                conference and, if so, he instruct Philippine Minister here issue
                                formal invitation and present written statement outlining in as much
                                detail as possible our posts and objectives as well as plans for
                                convening conference. If it is clear Quirino has lost interest in
                                convening conference, then I think we would do well to give some
                                support Phibun’s idea convening conference here, but I agree with
                                Department that initial stages any effort countries <gloss

                                    >Embtel</gloss> 2062, August 27. In opinion Embassy, Philippine
                                Government intends go ahead with plans for conference <gloss
                                    target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> nations for purpose discussing
                                proposed union. Department will recall, however, that Romulo gave
                                opinion as reported Embassy’s reference telegram that meeting could
                                not be held prior November and that he and Quirino pledged not call
                                conference till date sufficiently after Nehru’s US visit to ensure
                                that two events not appear connected.</p>
                            <p>For Embassy to take action suggested Bangkok’s reference telegram
                                would, in my opinion, place US in position of actively fostering
                                union, particularly as steps of this sort can scarcely be kept
                                secret in Manila. Moreover, it would place President Quirino in
                                position of being encouraged to arrive at important decisions re
                                union in Romulo’s absence. On basis President’s past performance, we
                                feel strongly that initiative should be left in hands Romulo.</p>

                            <p>The United States supports the emergence of a community of
                                independent Asiatic states in response to the nationalist
                                aspirations of Asiatic peoples. We believe that the governments of
                                Asiatic states <pb n="1197" xml:id="pg_1197" facs="0611"/>should be
                                based as broadly as possible upon the consent of their people and
                                should move at whatever pace is possible toward an increasing degree
                                of constitutional processes reflected in individual liberties,
                                representative government, free elections, and the due process of
                                law. It is a fundamental aim of United States policy to establish
                                friendly relations between the Asiatic states on the one hand and
                                the United States and other members of the Western World on the
                                other. It is in our interest to bring Asiatic states into active
                                cooperation with the rest of the world in terms of the Charter of
                                the United Nations and of other basic international charters. It is
                                in the interest of the United States to assist, through appropriate
                                means and within our capabilities, in bringing about an improvement
                                in the economic condition of the peoples of Asia and in stimulating
                                vigorous trade between Asia and the Western World.</p>
                            <p>In order to preserve conditions in which the above objectives can be
                                obtained over a period of time, it is essential that the spread of
                                Soviet Communism throughout Asia be halted as soon as practicable.
                                The incompatability between the objectives of Communism and the
                                objectives stated above is so fundamental and the security
                                implications of the association between Communist Asia and Soviet
                                Russia are so great that all forces in Asia which can be mobilized
                                to resist Communism should be encouraged even though some elements
                                do not meet the political standards which we would approve or expect
                                in other areas.</p>

                            <p>At my invitation Mr. Dening opened the conversation.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d383fn1">For earlier conversation oil Southeast Asia,

                                said that Mr. Bevin was concerned to discuss ways and means to
                                defend Southeast Asia against Communism. In reply to my question,
                                Mr. <pb n="1198" xml:id="pg_1198" facs="0612"/>Dening said that, for
                                their purposes, the expression “Southeast Asia” included
                                Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Indonesia,
                                Malaya, Indochina and the Philippines. Mr. Dening said that his
                                Government had earnestly considered the desirability of the
                                development of the Southeast Asian alliance and the regional
                                consciousness necessary to the formation of such an alliance. He
                                said Mr. MacDonald was of the view that the key to such an
                                arrangement was India; that Nehru’s India is at present disposed to
                                join no bloc, believing that it can successfully provide the basis
                                for a third force in the Asiatic world. In these circumstances Mr.
                                Dening believed that the British Government concurs that neither a
                                political nor a military regionalism is possible of development at
                                this time. Mr. Dening said that it was his Government’s view that
                                since a regional arrangement of the Southeast Asian states was
                                necessary to the successful resistance to Communism in Asia, the
                                economic approach to such a regional arrangement was the only one
                                possible in the circumstances. Mr. Dening went on to say that he
                                felt the Southeast Asian states could successfully be encouraged to
                                make a common approach to their economic problems and through this
                                experience to acquire the habit of thinking regionally. He stated
                                the intention of his Government in several ways, all designed to
                                make it clear that the British Government considered that the first
                                and necessary step toward meeting the Communist threat in Southeast
                                Asia was to develop the economies of the countries of the area to a
                                degree of strength equal if not superior to Communist pressure. Mr.
                                Dening said that his Government believed if such a program was
                                successful even in preserving the present standard of living in
                                Southeast Asia that area could be successfully oriented toward the
                                West.</p>
                            <p>I replied that while we were fully aware of the importance of the
                                economic factor in Southeast Asia, we were not convinced that a
                                solution of the economic problems of the area was a general panacea
                                for the general instability which has afflicted it. I suggested that
                                perhaps in the case of Siam and Malaya, where no great political
                                problems exist, a solution of outstanding economic problems might be
                                helpful if not decisive but that in Indonesia and Indochina the
                                essential political instabilities were an almost unsurmountable
                                obstacle to the successful extension of financial and economic
                                assistance; that indeed it was difficult to accept the desirability
                                of extending economic and financial assistance to those areas until
                                their political problems had approached a solution. Mr. Dening
                                replied that he understood Mr. Bevin and Mr. Acheson had agreed on a
                                previous occasion that no general formula for the solution of the
                                political difficulties of the area was forthcoming and that it was
                                possible in the circumstances to do no more than make a piecemeal or
                                a selective contribution to the solution of the political
                                difficulties which beset the area. I answered that it <pb n="1199"
                                    xml:id="pg_1199" facs="0613"/>appeared to me that the Department
                                was less pessimistic about the possible emergence of a regional
                                arrangement in Southeast Asia than Mr. Dening appeared to be. I said
                                that I thought India and the Philippines would doubtless play the
                                principal roles in this development, the Philppines almost certainly
                                playing a second to India’s first; that as we wanted any South Asian
                                alliance to arise from indigenous motivation, we had been at pains
                                to take no initiative toward its creation. I continued to say that
                                whatever financial assistance we might find ourselves able to extend
                                to the Asiatic states, we felt those states should move of their own
                                volition toward a solution of the Communist problem, both internal
                                and external; that India should soon recognize the character of the
                                Communist menace not only to her but to the other states of
                                Southeast Asia; and that India should be moved to impress upon her
                                neighbors the fact that the great enemy to their independence and
                                political and economic welfare was not colonialism but Communism. I
                                pointed out that apparently India’s efforts to impress upon Burma
                                the validity of these ideas had met with some success. Mr. Dening
                                said that India’s approach to Burma had been the result of
                                Commonwealth pressure and that the very fact that India did approach
                                Burma only upon the initiative of the British Commonwealth was an
                                evidence of the lack of cohesion between the Southeast Asian states.
                                He agreed that it was essential for the United States and the
                                British Commonwealth to keep out of the limelight of Southeast Asian
                                regional affairs but felt it absolutely essential to “pull the
                                strings” whenever necessary. I did not dissent from this general
                                proposition and stated that we had exerted some influence on General
                                Romulo to the end that President Quirino’s proposals for a
                                conference between the Asian states at Baguio be modified to a
                                somewhat more reasonable direction.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening opined that Mr. Acheson would be unable to express an
                                opinion as to the desirability of Western economic and financial
                                assistance to Southeast Asia, as proposed by his Government, until
                                he had examined the particulars of the proposals which Mr. Dening
                                said he hoped to place at Mr. Acheson’s disposal. He went on to say
                                that his Government had developed particular projects which it
                                thought recommended themselves as desirable recipients of economic
                                and financial aid from either the United States or the British
                                Commonwealth. I observed that I thought it relevant and useful to
                                bear in mind our experience with <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1"
                                    >ECAFE</gloss>. I pointed out that we had been obliged to
                                discourage the members of <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> in
                                their efforts to lay the foundations for a Marshall Plan for Asia,
                                not only because a Marshall Plan for Asia was in itself impractical
                                but because we felt that the Asiatic states should make increased
                                efforts to solve their own economic problems. I told Mr. Dening that
                                we had carefully considered what individual projects seem to
                                recommend themselves to us as <pb n="1200" xml:id="pg_1200"
                                    facs="0614"/>desirable recipients of economic and financial
                                assistance and that we had come to the conclusion that public
                                financing of practical projects should be done through the
                                Export–Import Bank and the World Bank.</p>
                            <p>There followed a somewhat general discussion of the character of
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> and of the part it might
                                play in the containment of Communism in Southeast Asia. Mr. Dening
                                observed that <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>, far from
                                proving a useful instrument to the creation of regionalism in
                                Southeast Asia, had, because of the presence of the Russians, been
                                virtually useless. I pointed out that while we had neither
                                encouraged the formation of <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss>
                                nor participated in its proceedings with enthusiasm, we had found it
                                necessary to address ourselves to the problems which Its very
                                existence created; that we had been obliged to discourage the
                                efforts of <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> to lay the
                                foundations for a Marshall Plan for Asia; and that we had used
                                    <gloss target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> as a forum in which to
                                instruct the Asiatic members of that organization as to the
                                necessity of their learning to help themselves. Mr. Dening pointed
                                out that the Asiatic powers had demonstrated, during <gloss
                                    target="#t_ECAFE1">ECAFE</gloss> conferences, no great ability
                                to agree amongst themselves on regional economic policies. I agreed
                                pointing out that the economies of the Asiatic states were
                                independent of each other while the economies of the West were
                                interdependent.</p>
                            <p>I returned to consideration of the British proposal by saying that I
                                was sympathetic to the British program of increasing food supply
                                throughout, the Southeast Asian states and to extending economic and
                                financial assistance to such a program through the World Bank and
                                the Export–Import Bank. I added that I felt it was a matter of great
                                importance that Japanese foreign trade be increased as a part of
                                such program both for the benefit of the Asiatic countries which
                                needed Japanese-manufactured goods and the Japanese which would
                                benefit enormously by recovering access to food and other raw
                                materials in Asia. As Mr. Dening appeared to agree in principle, I
                                asked if he considered such a trade with Malaya could be further
                                developed. Mr. Dening and Mr. Ford replied that while Japanese goods
                                were necessary to the normal functioning of the Malayan economy, the
                                fact that trade balances must be settled every six months in dollars
                                inclined the Malayans to minimize their trade with Japan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Lacy, referring to Mr. Dening’s belief that the influence of
                                India on the political orientation of Southeast Asia, asked if Mr.
                                Dening believed that the influence of anti-Communist minded Asiatic
                                states would have any appreciable influence on India. Mr. Dening
                                replied that he did indeed believe so; that India was learning more
                                about Communism in Asia as time went on; that for example Ho Chi
                                Minh’s radio association with Stalin had had a salutary effect upon
                                the Indian estimates of the Communist character of Ho Chi Minh’s
                                Government. <pb n="1201" xml:id="pg_1201" facs="0615"/>Mr. Landon
                                asked if Mr. Dening believed that Marshal Phibun’s proposal for a
                                convocation of the Southeast Asian states to plan an anti-Communist
                                front could be helpful in the circumstances. Mr. Dening said that he
                                thought India might be resentful of such proposals coming from small
                                powers since she had, as recently as the winter of 1949, failed in
                                her effort to create a South Asian confederation. Mr. Dening
                                repeated again his conviction that no cohesion in Southeast Asia was
                                possible unless provided by the Western powers.</p>
                            <p>Mr. McGhee asked if it was the British plan that projects for
                                economic development in Southeast Asia to receive assistance from
                                the West should receive that assistance from the World Bank and
                                Export–Import Bank. Mr. Dening replied in the affirmative. Mr.
                                McGhee asked if it was the British proposal that each project be
                                accepted or rejected in accordance with its practicality as a
                                bankable proposition. He added that a bankable project is not always
                                necessarily the most desirable project from a political point of
                                view. Mr. Dening replied that he hoped in the course of his visit to
                                the United States, Mr. Nehru might acquire some useful economic and
                                financial education.</p>
                            <p>I adverted to the subject of Southeast Asian regionalism by stating
                                that we were inclined on balance to consider that we could make use
                                of a regional arrangement in Southeast Asia in our anti-Communist
                                operations as long as we were at pains to avoid the appearance of
                                initiating the development of that regionalism. Mr. Dening appeared
                                to agree. I referred to the presently irreconcilable differences
                                which appeared to separate India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and
                                pointed out that the influence of India in bringing about a regional
                                arrangement of the other states of Southeast Asia might be lessened
                                by the effect of those very differences. Mr. Dening neither agreed
                                nor disagreed with this proposition but added that there existed
                                throughout Southeast Asia a considerable fear of India and that this
                                would require India to move very slowly in any regional arrangement
                                of states in Southeast Asia. I said that the presence of Chinese
                                minorities in Indochina, Siam, Malaya and Indonesia had alerted
                                those states to the imminence of Chinese Communist pressure. Mr.
                                Dening anticipated me somewhat by saying there were no Chinese
                                minorities in India which perhaps accounted for the lower
                                sensibility on the part of Indian leadership to Communist danger as
                                compared with leadership of other Southeast Asian states. Mr. Dening
                                remarked in this connection that he understood that US–UK war plans
                                contemplated great commitments in Europe and in the Middle
                                East—commitments so large that very little would be left over for
                                Asia; that in these circumstances it was important that we bend
                                every effort in the pre-war period toward enabling the Asiatics to
                                stand on their own feet in the event of conflict. I agreed.</p>
                            <pb n="1202" xml:id="pg_1202" facs="0616"/>
                            <p>Mr. Hare asked Mr. Dening if he considered Chinese Communism the
                                principal threat against which Western preparations should be made.
                                Mr. Dening replied that while Chinese Communism was certain to
                                continue to be a grave threat to the internal stability of the
                                states in that area, it was not considered that Chinese Communist
                                armies would engage in open aggression toward those states in the
                                near future. Mr. Hare then asked what plans if any the Commonwealth
                                had for the education of Indian leadership to the imminence of
                                Communist danger. Mr. Dening replied that Indian leadership was
                                still inclined to think in terms of India as a third world force. He
                                added that he thought India, as well as certain other Asiatic
                                states, was inclined to avoid associating itself with political
                                blocs because it feared U.S.S.R. opposition in the United Nations.
                                He thought that India, for example, should know that the U.S.S.R.
                                would veto Indian membership on the Security Council on [<hi
                                    rend="italic">or?</hi>] Indonesian Membership in the United
                                Nations without regard to the association of those states with any
                                political coalition. I agreed, pointing out that world Communists
                                regarded the present Indonesian Republic leadership as inplacable
                                enemies.</p>
                            <p>I turned the conversation to Indonesia by saying that it was the
                                general view in the Department that the creation and maintenance of
                                stability in Indonesia was in some part dependent upon the presence
                                in the area of Dutch troops; that as a practical matter the
                                Netherlands was short of transport capacity, a shortage that would
                                make a swift withdrawal of Netherlands forces impossible. I asked
                                Mr. Dening if he did not agree that withdrawal of Netherlands troops
                                from Indonesia should be both gradual and staged. Mr. Dening agreed
                                and said that he thought India and Pakistan should be convinced of
                                the desirability of a gradual withdrawal of Netherlands forces and
                                that he thought the Indian Ambassador at The Hague could be helpful
                                in this respect. He said the Indian Ambassador at The Hague seemed
                                convinced of the desirability of the Indonesians retaining Dutch
                                advisers after their independence had been attained. I then asked
                                Mr. Dening to dilate on his previously expressed view that the
                                matter of the Dutch retention of military and naval bases in
                                Indonesia should be left to informal agreement between the Dutch and
                                the Indonesians, and conversely should not be incorporated in the
                                statute of the union. Mr. Dening said that this was precisely the
                                view of his Government; that the British Ambassador at The Hague had
                                discussed this proposal with the Netherlands Foreign Office; that
                                the Netherlands Foreign Office had appeared to agree in principle
                                but had replied that unfortunately the problem of defense
                                arrangements was to appear early on the agenda of The Hague
                                Conference, and that they considered it unlikely that the
                                Indonesians would be prepared to defer to a later date discussion of
                                this matter. I referred to a report received by the Department to
                                the <pb n="1203" xml:id="pg_1203" facs="0617"/>effect that Mr. Nehru
                                had advised the Indonesians to avoid permitting disagreements on the
                                matter of Dutch bases in Indonesia to disrupt the negotiations at
                                The Hague. Mr. Dening said he had no knowledge of Mr. Nehru’s
                                position in this particular but thought the Indian Ambassador at The
                                Hague should be considered. I said, in summary, that the United
                                States Government was particularly anxious to preserve Dutch
                                influence in Indonesia in the economic, political and strategic
                                sense; that it was our hope that the Dutch, when they withdrew,
                                would provide the Indonesians with both training and equipment so
                                that the Indonesian armed forces could gradually take over the
                                responsibility for the preservation of law and order.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hare suggested that some of the confusion in analyzing the
                                likelihood of the emergence of a Southeast Asian union of states
                                arose from a failure to recognize that India, taken by itself, was
                                perhaps not the strong point in such a union that some had supposed.
                                Mr. Dening agreed. There followed something of a general discussion
                                on what could be done to contribute to a solution of the Kashmir
                                dispute. It was the consensus that the acceptance of the principle
                                of partition would only result in narrowing the area and not the
                                problem; that Pakistan would not be satisfied by partition and that
                                Nehru was incapable of a reasonable approach to the Kashmir problem.
                                It was also agreed that while a solution reached through arbitration
                                and imposed on both parties seemed the logical solution, an imposed
                                solution is invariably unsatisfactory to either side and results in
                                the abuse of the arbitrator. In answer to Mr. Hare’s question, Mr.
                                Dening and Mr. Meade expressed the view that India’s record in the
                                Kashmir case would undoubtedly have an adverse effect upon her
                                candidacy for membership on the Security Council. Mr. Dening
                                suggested that India might well be made aware of the fact that her
                                performance in Kashmir had made her unpopular in the United Nations
                                to the end that her intransigence in this particular might be
                                reduced. Mr. Hare suggested that perhaps it would be necessary to
                                “accept the absurd” and recognize the Afghanistan dispute as
                                involving a complex of special factors giving rise to a problem for
                                which no solution presently exists. There appeared to be general
                                agreement with this view; Mr. Mathews and Mr. Dening observing that
                                no rational solution was possible when the individuals involved were
                                of an unreasonable frame of mind.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dening then addressed a few remarks to the Burmese problem
                                stating that his Government believed it had no choice but to support
                                the present Government of Burma in spite of its highly
                                unsatisfactory character. Further discussion of Burma was deferred
                                until Wednesday morning at 10:30.</p>
                            <p>In answer to questions concerning the present status of the
                                Dutch–Indonesian dispute, Mr. Dening expressed the opinion that:
                                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the Indonesians could not be brought
                                to accept the principle of the retention <pb n="1204"
                                    xml:id="pg_1204" facs="0618"/>by the Netherlands–Indonesian
                                union of executive power. He added that since only consultative
                                powers resided in the British Commonwealth arrangements, his
                                Government would find it difficult to press the Indonesians to
                                accept a different principle for the Netherlands–Indonesian Union,
                                and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that the Indians could be helpful, if
                                not decisive, in inducing the Indonesians to adopt a reasonable and
                                constructive attitude toward compliance with the cease fire order,
                                the embodiment of reasonable economic and financial provisions in
                                the constitution of the United States of Indonesia, and in the
                                granting of military and naval bases to the Netherlands; and (<hi
                                    rend="italic">c</hi>) that the Indonesian attitude toward the
                                formation of a common front against Communism would coincide with
                                that of India.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Butterworth then summarized his recent discussions with Dening of
                                the British Foreign Office. He said that the British were now
                                desirous of pressing vigorously forward with the Japanese Peace
                                Treaty, urging that all the eleven nations concerned be invited to
                                attend the conference but that the conference be held even though
                                Russia and China did not attend. The British felt that U.S. security
                                requirements such as for bases can be met through a separate
                                agreement between the United States and Japan.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth said that he had impressed on Mr. Dening that before
                                calling a peace conference the United States must have firm
                                commitments from the British Commonwealth powers that they would
                                support a common attitude on the key issues. Mr. Butterworth urged
                                that the Secretary press this same point with Mr. Bevin and that he
                                also attempt to obtain from Mr. Bevin a more tolerant attitude in
                                regard to extending the authority of the Japanese Government prior
                                to conclusion of the treaty.</p>
                            <p>As to China, Mr. Butterworth said the British were willing to control
                                exports of 1–A commodities and petroleum, including control of
                                exports from Hong Kong, and to join the United States in seeking an
                                agreement of the other principal trading countries. They would not,
                                however, agree even to stand-by controls for 1–B commodities. As to
                                Hong Kong, the British are fully determined to hold the Island and
                                not to negotiate in regard to its ultimate disposition with any
                                unfriendly Chinese Government. They consider Hong Kong one end of
                                the bastion in Southeast Asia, of which India is the other. The
                                British would not, however, defend Macao and doubt that the
                                Portuguese could hold it. The over-all British attitude toward China
                                is that the Civil War is over, that they must deal with the Chinese
                                Communists, that they will not liquidate their commercial interests,
                                that they will not hurry recognition but will probably recognize
                                sooner or later. Mr. Butterworth pointed out that this British
                                attitude represented an unusual alliance between the City, which was
                                interested in the commercial stake, and the Left, which wishes to
                                normalize relations with the Communists. Mr. Kennan commented that
                                the British are suffering from a delusion if they think they can
                                profit in China from a policy of disunity between themselves and the
                                United States. The important point is on whose terms trade is
                                carried on. Mr. Butterworth mentioned the necessity of keeping in
                                mind the effect on Japan of a restrictive trade policy. Ambassador
                                Stuart remarked that the top Communist leaders are quite aware that
                                they cannot get economic help from the Soviets and must obtain it
                                from us in order to survive.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Kennan referred to telegram No. 1994 of September 5 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">3</hi>] from Nanking<note n="3" xml:id="d384fn3"
                                    >Scheduled for publication in volume <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >viii</hi>.</note> as being an excellent brief statement of
                                the desirable overall policy to pursue toward the Chinese
                                Communists. It developed that the Consultants, <gloss
                                    target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> and Ambassador Stuart were all in
                                general agreement with the line of policy stated in this telegram.
                                Mr. Kennan felt that in addition it was vital that there be a firm
                                stand on protection of U.S. representatives and nationals in China
                                and that this implied the application of unilateral sanctions if
                                necessary. He also pointed out that the policy outlined in the
                                telegram may require different action than Britain on the question
                                of recognition and that the U.S. public should be prepared for this
                                difference. The Secretary pointed out that there would be some
                                difficulty in applying the policy set forth in this telegram in view
                                of the attitude of U.S. public opinion and the Congress. For
                                instance, there was the question of the use of 75 million dollars of
                                discretionary funds in the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Act.
                                Mr. Jessup urged that the apparently negative aspects of the
                                proposed policy should be counteracted by affirmative action
                                wherever possible, such as a reaffirmation of the “Open Door” policy
                                and action on the Japanese Treaty. The Secretary inquired what
                                concretely would the phrase about not making the Communists’ bed
                                easier have on our trade policy. Dr. Fosdick suggested that we
                                follow the policy set forth in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                                    41.<note n="4" xml:id="d384fn4">February 28, approved March 3;
                                        <ref target="frus1949v09#pg_826">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                            >ix</hi>, p. 826</ref>.</note> The Secretary indicated
                                there might be contradiction between the telegram’s recognition that
                                the Communists be forced to learn the “hard way” that they cannot
                                get along without the West, and the suggestion in <gloss
                                    target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 41 that such a policy might throw
                                them into the arms of the Soviets. Mr. Butterworth felt that in view
                                of all the present obstacles to trade with Communist China, the mere
                                continued absence of loans and credits from the West would keep it
                                to small proportions and result in the Communists learning the “hard
                                way” that they cannot get along without the West.</p>
                            <p>As to recognition of the Communist regime, the Secretary said he
                                would urge Bevin to go slow and to exact satisfactory performance
                                from the Communists on their international obligations. Mr.
                                Butterworth expressed the hope that recognition would not come soon
                                and that there would definitely be consultations before any action
                                was taken. He asked the Secretary to mention to Bevin the ambiguous
                                effect of continued presence of the British ambassador in Nanking.
                                Mr. Jessup urged that we and the British jointly approach the
                                Southeast Asian governments at a somewhat later time in order to
                                explain fully our position on recognition before action is taken. He
                                felt that we must consider very carefully before we put ourselves in
                                a unilateral position on this question. Mr. Rusk urged that we in
                                any case wait until it was clear that the Communists controlled
                                substantially all of China.</p>
                            <pb n="1207" xml:id="pg_1207" facs="0621"/>
                            <p>The Secretary inquired what we should do about Formosa. Mr. Jessup
                                suggested the possibility of a United Nations commission if Chiang
                                Kai-shek could be persuaded to ask for it. Mr. Merchant declared the
                                British were defeatists on this subject and felt that referring the
                                matter to the U.N. would do more harm than good. Mr. Rusk urged that
                                we at least approach Chiang on the matter and pointed out that U.S.
                                opinion will demand some action by this Government on the Formosa
                                question short of military intervention. The Secretary was doubtful
                                whether reference to the U.N. would be successful. He felt it might
                                only show off the weakness of the United Nations. Ambassador Stuart
                                pointed out the danger of inflaming anti-United States sentiment in
                                China by our stand on Formosa. Mr. Merchant expressed doubt that
                                Chiang would make any substantial concessions in view of the fact
                                that he expects shortly war between the United States and
                                Russia.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary summed up our attitude on trade with Communist China by
                                saying that we would let normal cash trade go, that we would prevent
                                exports of 1–A items and that we would place 1–B items under control
                                but would for the present issue licenses freely.</p>
                            <p>As to Indochina, Mr. Butterworth said that the British are cautious
                                of supporting Bao Dai and of putting pressure on the French to this
                                effect. He hoped the Secretary would urge Bevin to persuade the
                                Commonwealth Governments to take the lead in recognition of Bao Dai
                                and to press Schuman to carry out French commitments rapidly. Mr.
                                Jessup strongly supported this recommendation. Mr. Butterworth
                                urged, however, that it would be desirable that recognition by the
                                Asiatic states precede recognition by the Western states.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Butterworth mentioned briefly two or three of the more serious
                                issues which confront the Round-table Conference on Indonesia but
                                did not feel these need be taken up with Bevin at this time.</p>
                            <p>As to a Pacific Pact, Mr. Butterworth reported that the British are
                                reluctant to have a rival to the Empire in this part of the world;
                                that they consider the Asiatics will be reluctant to do much unless
                                pressed from behind and they consider the Empire the proper
                                instrument of pressure. Bevin will, however, ask what economic help
                                we can provide in Southeast Asia. Mr. McGhee pointed out the
                                difficulty created by the fact that on the one hand the other states
                                of the area are suspicious of India’s taking the initiative, while
                                India will refuse to let others take the initiative. The British
                                solution appears to be a program of economic aid country by country
                                rather than jointly. It does not appear, however, that they intend
                                to dump India’s economic problems into our lap. He doubts that the
                                International Bank would be able to meet India’s needs fully but
                                pointed out that we had no overall policy in regard to the area on
                                which we could base a program of grants. The Secretary commented
                                that this problem had been discussed in the recent financial talks
                                and that it would be further studied by a continuing <pb n="1208"
                                    xml:id="pg_1208" facs="0622"/>body. He said that the British
                                realize they cannot go on bearing this burden indefinitely. Mr.
                                Jessup pointed out that our economic approach is close to that of
                                the British and it should not be difficult to merge projects which
                                we may both propose. Mr. McGhee said that a grant program in fact is
                                not necessary for India and that we need in any case a better
                                accounting of the use India is making of her dollars. Mr.
                                Butterworth recommended that the Secretary point out to Bevin that
                                we believe a Pacific Union should have indigenous roots but that we
                                also believe we should encourage it. A security pact in that area is
                                not necessary at this time but may eventually be so. Mr. Jessup
                                suggested that the Secretary in his conversation with Bevin refer to
                                the latter’s support in the April conversations of a Far Eastern
                                regional grouping.<note n="5" xml:id="d384fn5">See Mr. Bevin’s April

                                He also recommended there be discussed with Bevin the proposed
                                reaffirmation of the “Open Door” policy in connection with Chinese
                                United Nations case. Mr. Butterworth agreed but urged there be no
                                mention of the Nine Power Treaty which had been so ineffective.<note

                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> is of the opinion that the
                                subject paper presents what is in effect a North and East Asian
                                policy. South Asia is relegated to a secondary and even minor role.
                                India, the dominant nation of South Asia, will not accept such a
                                role, and any US policy which presumes that it will is doomed to
                                failure—as an Asia-wide policy.</p>
                            <p>The over-emphasis on North and East Asia reveals itself many times.
                                Section 5 points out that if Japan were added to the communist <pb
                                    n="1209" xml:id="pg_1209" facs="0623"/>bloc the balance of world
                                power might become dangerously weighted against the US. A similarly
                                specific assessment of the dangerous implications of communist
                                domination of India and Pakistan is lacking. It may be argued that,
                                if achieved by means short of war, communist domination of these two
                                countries would be even more adverse to our interests than communist
                                control of Japan. If India and Pakistan fell to communism, it would
                                almost certainly be impossible for the West to retain any foothold
                                on the Asian continent, with the possible exception of South Korea.
                                We should be reduced to the minimum offshore defense line discussed
                                in Section 20. The loss of Japan would not necessarily entail such a
                                withdrawal from the mainland of Asia.</p>
                            <p>Section 15 states that US ability to exert influence in terms of
                                power and prestige flows primarily from our occupation of Japan and
                                our rights in the Philippines and other Pacific islands. This may be
                                true in North and East Asia, but in South Asia our influence is not
                                primarily so founded. To the contrary, South Asia tends to suspect
                                that our activities in the Western Pacific reflect imperial
                                ambitions.…</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff concept of a Pacific
                                Association again looks to North and East Asia. (The term itself is
                                a misnomer if it is intended to include the South Asian countries.)
                                We know that the Philippine Republic, Korea and presumably Japan
                                would welcome the realization of this concept—particularly because
                                of its security aspects; we know equally well that India would at
                                present oppose it—particularly because of its security aspects.</p>
                            <p>In summary, it appears to <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> that
                                the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Staff has approached the
                                problem of Asia with an “either-or” attitude, i.e. we must
                                concentrate on either Japan and North and East Asia, or India and
                                South Asia. <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> holds that we can
                                and must, in formulating policy for Asia, give full consideration to
                                the special circumstances and potentialities of both areas and of
                                the intermediate Southeast Asian area.</p>

                                                  recognizing the Chinese Communist regime until it
                                                  is clearly in the United States interest to do so.
                                                  The United States should continue to express to
                                                  friendly governments its own views concerning the
                                                  dangers of hasty recognition of the Chinese
                                                  Communist regime but should not take a stand which
                                                  would engage the prestige of the United States in
                                                  an attempt to prevent such recognition. In
                                                  general, however, it should be realized that it
                                                  would be inappropriate for the United States to
                                                  adopt a posture more hostile or policies more
                                                  harsh towards a Communist China than towards the
                                                  USSR itself. It should also be realized that the
                                                  according of recognition by other friendly
                                                  countries would affect the bargaining position of
                                                  the United States in the absence of United States
                                                  recognition and would affect United States private
                                                  and national interests in China. In the event that
                                                  recognition of the Chinese Communists is
                                                  anticipated, appropriate steps should be taken to
                                                  make it clear that recognition should not be
                                                  construed as approval of the Chinese Communist
                                                  regime, or abatement of our hostility to Soviet
